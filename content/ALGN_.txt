clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting approximately 60 to 75 of the global population annually approximately 21 million people globally elect treatment by orthodontists today most orthodontic patients continue to have their malocclusions treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces augmented with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may recommend the patient use a retainer appliance of the 21 million cases started we estimate that approximately 90 or 19 million could be treated using our invisalign system in addition globally approximately 500 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth this represents a significant opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by training more doctors including gps as well as orthodontists educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using the invisalign system and connecting consumers with an invisaligntrained doctor of their choice 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computersimulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear polymer removable aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and access to proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

diagnosis and transmission of treatment data  an invisalign trained dental professional prepares an online prescription form on our invisalign doctor site and submits the patients records which include a digital intraoral scan or a polyvinylsiloxane “pvs” impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition intraoral digital scans may be submitted through align’s itero scanner or certain thirdparty scanners capable of accurately interfacing with our systems and processes globally more than 85 of invisalign system case submissions are now submitted via digital scan increasing the accuracy of treatments reducing the time from prescription submission to patient receipt and decreasing the carbon footprint resulting from the shipment of the materials used to form pvs impressions to the doctors and shipping those pvs impressions back to us additionally it is during this stage that exocad’s cadcam software platform can be used to identify assess and assist doctors and dental labs to collaborate on any needed orthorestorative treatment options through comprehensive interdisciplinary workflows 

computersimulated treatment plan  using the digital scans or pvs impressions certain doctor preferences and digital data provided we generate a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck ® treatment plan using proprietary software we have developed through significant ongoing investments over more than 20 years a patient’s clincheck treatment plan simulates desired tooth movement in stages and details the timing and placement of any features or attachments to be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to affect the desired movements 

review and approval of the treatment plan by an invisalign trained doctor the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via align’s invisalign doctor site enabling the dental professional to evaluate projected tooth movement from initial position to final position and compare multiple treatment plan options by reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control of the patient’s treatment 

manufacture of custom aligners following the dental professional’s approval of a clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation as input for the next stage in which we use stereolithography technology a form of 3d printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear polymer removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series designed to correspond to each stage of the patients clincheck treatment plan 

shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear once manufactured all the aligners for a patients doctorapproved treatment plan are typically shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals aligners are generally worn for a short period of time corresponding to the stages of the patient’s approved clincheck treatment plan and their doctor’s discretion the patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement through each stage at various points in each patient’s treatment their doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and the approved clincheck treatment plan additionally for patients treated using many of our invisalign system treatments doctors have the option to adjust treatment plans to achieve desired results by ordering additional clear aligners in accordance with predefined terms 

clear aligner products 

we offer our invisalign system in a variety of treatment packages designed to correspond with the casebycase treatment needs of our doctors and their patients the table below provides a general description of the categories of treatment products we offer in various regions as they typically correspond to the severity of malocclusion and length of anticipated treatment 



 the number of stages can vary by product and region 

most of our invisalign system treatment plans described above provide dental professionals with the option to order additional aligners if the patients treatment deviates from the original treatment plan the number and timing of additional aligner orders are subject to certain requirements noted in our terms and conditions 

comprehensive products  invisalign treatment options 

invisalign comprehensive packages  the invisalign comprehensive package is used to treat adults and teens over a wide spectrum of mild to severe malocclusion and contains a broad variety of invisalign features to address the desired treatment goals it also addresses the frequently complex orthodontic needs of teenage or younger patients with advanced features such as mandibular advancement compliance indicators and compensation for tooth eruption these packages include invisalign comprehensive invisalign first phase 1 and invisalign first comprehensive phase 2

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to iso 134852016 an internationally recognized standard for medical device quality we are routinely audited by third party certification bodies as well as global health authorities for our compliance to this quality standard as well as international regulations we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capacity and capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supplier relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single or sole source suppliers we also currently purchase our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source a discussion of the risks of our supply and manufacturing operations including foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  risk factors 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing efforts are focused on increasing adoption and utilization of the invisalign system and vivera retainers by orthodontists and gps worldwide and integrating the itero scanner and exocad cadcam products into dental labs and practices the scanner is an important component to the customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of invisalign treatments in each region we have direct sales marketing and support 

organizations which include quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration we also have distribution partners in certain markets our sales and marketing personnel are organized to support orthodontists and gps separately allowing highly trained and specialized personnel to serve each customer category thereby increasing our focus and effectiveness on both we continue to expand in existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources professional marketing and education programs additionally our consumer marketing programs are designed to create awareness and educate consumers on the benefits of invisalign treatment and vivera retainers including where they can find a trained doctor to provide treatment 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 122500 active invisalign trained doctors we define doctors as active if they have submitted at least one case in the prior 12month period 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass digital technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion our intraoral scanners as the preferred scanning technology for digital dental scans and our exocad cadcam software as the solution of choice for dental labs 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing digital technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and solutions to enable the align digital platform these activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies products and software 

in an effort to demonstrate the broad treatment capabilities of the invisalign system various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign treatment to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity similarly various studies have also been published demonstrating the capabilities of our scanners including advanced features such as our niri technology we undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to our products and manufacturing process we furthermore fund research in the field of orthodontics and dentistry through initiatives such as our annual research award program which was in its 12th year in 2021 our donations to the american association of orthodontists foundation and our partnership with medtech innovator asia pacific a nonprofit startup accelerator for the medical technology industry that connects healthcare industry leaders with innovative medical technology startups for mentorship and support 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property portfolio represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2021 we had 642 active us patents 724 active foreign patents and 736 pending global patent applications our active us patents expire between 2022 and 2040 when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided which could negatively impact our operating results however as we continue to pursue new innovations we seek intellectual property protection for new inventions and knowhow through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we furthermore have a broad and diverse trademark portfolio that we use to highlight and protect our universally recognized brands information regarding risks associated with our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we have historically experienced seasonal trends within our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve sales of the invisalign system are often weaker in europe especially southern european countries during the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday and seasonally higher in china during the third quarter similarly other international holidays like lunar new year can impact our sales in apac in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our systems and services segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates moreover the covid19 pandemic with its consequent office closures or capacity constraints imposed to curtail the spread of the virus and its variants and the easing and 

reimplementation of those restrictions has exacerbated the timing and extent of seasonal patterns and it remains unclear when or if they will return to historical norms 

competition 

our clear aligner products compete directly against traditional orthodontic treatments that use metal brackets and wires and increasingly against clear aligner products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us although the number of competitors varies by segment product geography and customer they include new and wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities due in part to the expiration of certain of our clear aligner key patents beginning in 2017 and the significant benefits of clear aligner treatment over traditional brackets and wires competition in the clear aligner market is increasing in addition corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has increased competition outside the us these competitors include existing larger companies in certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us directtoconsumer “dtc” companies that provide clear aligners requiring little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed doctors and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3d printing technology unlike our dtc competitors we are committed to doctors being at the core of our business strategy and invisalign treatment requires a doctors prescription and an inperson physical examination of the patient’s dentition before treatment can begin 

additionally we face competition in the emerging and rapidly evolving markets for intraoral scanners and software solutions including cadcam the global intraoral scanner market is very dynamic with participants spanning from traditional dental conglomerates to companies dedicated primarily to scanner development and sales with new entrants from south korea and china playing larger roles information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “ risk factors ” 

we believe we are well positioned to compete in the markets we target we have a dedicated sales force of over 4000 employees who are focused on key demographics in our target markets that allow us to uniquely address customer needs and thereby enhance the customer experience our significant historical and ongoing investments in research and design around the movement of teeth smarttrack aligner materials and design intraoral scanning 3d manufacturing global scale of manufacturing and treatment planning strong brand name recognition and an in depth understanding of the drivers and motivations within the orthodontic and gp dental markets are among a few of our key competitive factors that compare favorably with our competitors’ products and services 

government regulation 

many countries throughout the world have established regulatory frameworks for commercialization of medical devices as a designer manufacturer and marketer of medical devices we are obligated to comply with the respective frameworks of these countries to obtain and maintain access to these global markets the frameworks often define requirements for marketing authorizations which vary by country failure to obtain appropriate marketing authorization and to meet all local requirements including specific quality and safety standards in any country in which we currently market our products could cause commercial disruption andor subject us to sanctions and fines delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such marketing authorizations or the loss of any previously received authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

with regards to premarket authorization in the us many of our products are classified as medical devices under the us food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” the fdc act requires these products when sold in the us to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with medical device regulations defined by the fda the regulatory framework depends on a set of written processes for ensuring consistent quality called a quality management system “qms” coupled with a product marketing authorization which depends on the risk classification of the product this regulatory framework is comparable to the framework established in the european union “eu” within the eu our products are subject to the requirements defined by the medical device regulation eu 2017745 which replaced the medical device directive 9342eec with a final transition date of may 26 2021 similar market access regulations exist in brazil china japan and other countries our qms is routinely audited by certification bodies as well as country regulators for compliance with applicable regulations we believe we are in compliance with all state federal and international regulatory requirements applicable to our products 

we are also subject to various laws around the world that govern interactions with our customers as healthcare professionals or government officials the laws govern different interactions and may include prohibiting improper influence of or payments to healthcare professionals and government officials setting out rules for when and how to engage healthcare professionals as our vendors requiring price reporting regulations requiring proper and on label promotion sale and marketing 

of our products and services importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products and disclosure of payments to healthcare professionals and entities as we expand our operations footprint countries to which we sell and invest in new business models compliance with applicable laws becomes more complex and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement 

initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by state or federal funded programs such as medicaid a foreign national healthcare program or private pay insurance each of which may offer some degree of oversight as we expand our customer base and product offering it is increasingly possible that there will be new opportunities to seek reimbursement from public and private payors for services that include our products and additional laws or regulatory enforcement requirements may apply now or in the future also as a medical device manufacturer and seller we are subject to transparency reporting laws also known as sunshine laws that in certain countries require us to report transfers of value to healthcare professionals that perform services or receive other items from us eg meals travel branded promotional or educational items or other benefits of value many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years enforcement actions and associated efforts to respond or defend against such actions can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection and storage requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us china and other countries to multinational requirements in the eu including laws that regulate or restrict cross border data transfers in the us we must comply with final regulations implementing amendments to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the associated hipaa security rule we are also required to comply with the california consumer privacy act and are preparing for a number of statelevel laws and bills in the us including the california privacy rights act of 2020 in the eu we must comply with the general data protection regulation which serves as a harmonization of european dataprivacy law and the swiss federal act on data protection where align has its emea headquarters in latam markets we must comply with brazils lei geral de proteção de dados meanwhile the apac and emea regions have also seen rapid development of privacy laws including turkey morocco ghana india russia china south korea singapore hong kong israel and australia

risks relating to our business operations and strategy 

our results of operations have been materially adversely affected by global and regional efforts to mitigate the spread of covid19 and we expect this will continue in as yet unknown ways and to varying degrees as the virus evolves and circumstances dictate 

the broad and extensive impact of the covid19 pandemic on virtually all aspects of our business and society has exacerbated many preexisting risks to our business by making them more likely to occur or more impactful when they do occur accordingly you should consider the risks described in this risk factor in addition to and not in lieu of the risks described elsewhere throughout these risk factors 

covid19 has created significant widespread and unprecedented volatility uncertainty and economic instability disrupting broad aspects of the global economy our operations and the businesses of our customers and suppliers many of these effects continue to varying degrees and further mutated variants and outbreaks globally or regionally continue to harm recovering consumer confidence and have led to renewed implementation of harsh preventative measures by local and regional governments and businesses therefore comparing our financial results for the reporting periods of 2021 to the same reporting periods of 2020 or 2019 may not be a useful means by which to evaluate the health of our business and our results of operations 

as a result of the pandemic customer demand and doctor availability has been inconsistent and difficult to predict although the practices of the doctors dental service organizations and labs that are our principal customers have largely reopened many continue to operate at less than prepandemic capacities in addition new variants of the virus have caused unpredictable fluctuations in the number of patients seeking treatment and the number of doctors providing the services and 

treatments while the pandemic increased demand for digital solutions such as the products and solutions we offer for the dental field it is unclear whether increased demand for our products will continue for instance if the use of video conferencing declines when employees return to office work environments or the availability of travel dining entertainment and other consumer spending categories rebound demand for our products or the growth rates for our products may decline these fluctuations have adversely impacted our results of operations from time to time in the recent past and are expected to continue to impact our results particularly in the near term 

in response to the pandemic in 2020 we implemented measures aimed at limiting its spread for the health and safety of our employees customers patients and the communities in which we live and work as well as in accordance with orders and decrees of governmental agencies these measures included diagnostic screenings at our facilities increased social distancing mandates closures of physical offices manufacturing and treatment planning facilities including our us corporate headquarters and regional facilities worldwide implementing remote working where feasible and prohibiting nonessential travel many of these actions remain in effect to varying degrees and we may implement new or revise existing measures as circumstances require the actions and reactions to voluntary and involuntary protective measures have been highly disruptive to our business and may continue to be disruptive 

the rules and regulations for reopening and operating our offices will likely increase in complexity making compliance more difficult furthermore if employees perceive the protocols and requirements we implement to create a safe and effective work environment to be inadequate overly burdensome or no longer necessary or alternatively if we require employees to return to the office when they prefer the safety or convenience of working from home employees may choose to leave productivity may decline or we may experience employee unrest slowdowns stoppages or other demands additionally we may fail to timely meet customer demand or fulfill orders the costs to maintain or implement protective measures or deliver our products may increase and we may be subject to increased litigation including product liability and occupational safety and condition claims for further discussion or the risks related to employee satisfaction retention and engagement see the risk factor “ we rely on our personnel and i f we fail to attract motivate or retain personnel or if our growth harms our corporate culture it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities” 

as the economic and societal impact of the pandemic continues we are continually evaluating macroeconomic as well as industryspecific factors including the extent our business and financial results and the business and financial results of our customers’ and suppliers’ have been and in the future may be impacted the financial health and stability of businesses and consumers overall depends on numerous evolving factors many of which we cannot control nor accurately predict examples include 

• the duration scope and severity of governmental business and societal actions in response to the pandemic 

• the impact on worldwide economic activity employment rates and actions taken by central banks and governments 

• customer and consumer purchasing behavior changes as pandemicrelated restrictions are curtailed lifted or reinstated and travel and discretionary spending patterns shift 

• the response of employees customers and suppliers to the reimplementation or easing of social distancing mandates and returning to inoffice or facility working including anxieties regarding the continuing risks of the spread of the virus or any of its variants vaccination requirements and other mandates that may impact employee productivity and engagement retention or require additional costly protective measures 

• the liquidity of funds and financial stability of consumers customers and patients including their willingness to purchase our products and services delays paying for products or services requests for extended payment terms or payment defaults 

• disruptions and shortages impacting the cost availability and timing of the procurement delivery manufacturing and overall supply chain for raw materials components parts and products including semiconductor chips 

• delays and cancellations as a result of port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns 

• travel and gathering restrictions including those that adversely impair or prohibit our sales personnel from interacting with customers or that limit patients from visiting their doctors or capacity limits on the number of patients doctors can see in their offices 

• actions by competitors such as price reductions aggressive product promotions changes in or the launch or termination of products or product lines and mergers consolidations and liquidations 

• the confidence of our customers and patients that our products and solutions are sanitary and safe to use 

• data privacy and cybersecurity risks from new or expanded use of remote working andor teledentistry by our suppliers customers and us including new or expanded use of online service platforms products and solutions such as video conferencing applications doctor consumer and patient apps inadequately secured computing networks servers software or software applications overheard telephone conversations viewable computer screens stolen passwords or access information increased phishing and other cyber threats 

• the impact of remote working arrangements on our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting including our ability to ensure information required to be disclosed is timely and accurately recorded processed summarized reported and communicated to management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure and 

• diversion of management’s attention as they focus on the short and longterm ramifications of the pandemic 

the effects of the pandemic continue to linger and evolve and we cannot predict future direct and ancillary impacts on our business or results of operations although they may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price as well as the businesses of our customers suppliers and economic activity generally 

our net revenues are dependent primarily on our invisalign system and itero scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products for any reason may adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

our net revenues remain largely dependent on sales of our invisalign system of clear aligners an d itero intraoral scanners of the two we expect net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily our comprehensive products will continue to account for the majority of our net revenues making the continued and widespread acceptance of the invisalign system by orthodontists gps and consumers critical to our future success our itero scanners have become a material percentage of our overall revenues although exocad and its cadcam software solutions are important to the continuing evolution of the align digital platform the contributions to our total net revenues from the exocad solutions remain immaterial our operating results could be harmed if 

• orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services 

• consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign system treatment as rapidly or in the volumes we anticipate and at the prices offered 

• orthodontists or gps choose to continue using wires and brackets or competitive products rather than the invisalign system or the rates at which they utilize the invisalign system fail to increase or increase as rapidly as anticipated 

• sales of our itero scanners decline or fail to grow sufficiently or as expected 

• the growth of cadcam solutions does not produce the results expected or 

• if the average selling price of our products declines 

the average selling prices of our products particularly our invisalign system are influenced by numerous factors including the type and timing of products sold particularly the timing of orders for additional clear aligners for certain invisalign products and foreign exchange rates in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices which may differ based on country our average selling prices have been impacted in the past and may be adversely affected again in the future if 

• we introduce new or change existing promotions general or volumebased discount programs product or services bundles or consumer rebate programs 

• participation in any promotions or programs unexpectedly increases or decreases or drives demand in unexpected and material ways 

• our geographic channel or product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue 

• we decrease prices on one or more products or services in response to increasing competitive pricing pressures 

• we introduce new or change existing products or services or modify how we market or sell any of our new or existing products or services or 

• our critical accounting estimates materially differ from actual behavior or results 

if any of the foregoing were to occur our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may decline 

competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future and customers who alone or with others create orthodontic appliances and solutions or other products or services that compete with us 

the dental industry is in a period of immense and rapid digital transformation involving products technologies distribution channels and business models while solutions such as our invisalign system itero scanners and cadcam software facilitate this transition whether our technologies will achieve market acceptance and if adopted whether and when they may become obsolete as new offerings become available remains unclear 

currently the invisalign system competes directly against traditional metal wires and brackets and increasingly against clear aligners manufactured and distributed by new market entrants and manufacturers of traditional wires and brackets both within and outside the us and from traditional medical device companies laboratories startups and in some cases doctors and dsos themselves due in part to market opportunities and the expiration of certain of our key patents beginning in 2017 competition in the clear aligner market is increasing the number and types of competitors are diverse and growing rapidly they vary by segment geography and size and include new and wellestablished regional competitors as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research financial capabilities and existing dental market channels our competitors also include directtoconsumer “dtc” companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model requiring little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed doctors and doctors and dsos who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3d printing technology large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market 

the manipulation and movement of teeth and bone is a complex and delicate process with potentially painful and debilitating results if improperly performed or monitored accordingly we are committed to delivering our invisalign system solutions primarily through trained and skilled doctors invisalign system treatment requires a doctors prescription and an in person physical examination of the patient’s dentition before beginning treatment however with the advent of dtc providers there has been a shift away from traditional dental practices that may impact our primary selling channels doctors and dsos are sampling alternative products and taking advantage of competitive promotions and sale opportunities in addition we face competition from companies that introduce new technologies and we may be unable to compete with these competitors or they may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any new technologies our business could be harmed 

to stimulate product and services demand we have a history of offering volume discounts price reductions and other promotions to targeted customers and consumers whether or not successful these promotional campaigns have had and may in the future again have unexpected and unintended consequences including reduced gross margins profitability and average selling prices net revenues volume growth and net income 

we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues are derived from international sales and we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political military and other risks that may harm our business 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations and we expect to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in markets we believe have highgrowth potential moreover we perform many of our key production steps in locations outside of the us for instance our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations including largescale operations in mexico costa rica and china and we continue to establish additional sites closer to our international customers such as our manufacturing facility in poland currently under construction also we maintain significant regional sales and marketing operations in switzerland singapore and china along with research and development operations globally including in the us russia israel and germany our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operations including 

• difficulties managing international operations including any travel restrictions on us or our customers 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• import and export risks including shipping delays cost increases penalties controls license requirements and restrictions 

• controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process 

• the engagement in activities by our employees contractors partners and agents prohibited by our policies and procedures as well as international and local trade labor and other laws such as those prohibiting bribery and corrupt payments to government officials including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act of 2010 and export control laws 

• delays disruptions and increasing costs to us and our suppliers for raw materials or components manufacturing and transportation including as a result of customs clearance port congestion workforce unrest or labor shortages slowdowns or stoppages unionization efforts or disasters whether natural forces or human caused 

• increased expense of developing testing manufacturing and marketing localized versions of our products

the potential impacts of the united kingdom’s “uk” withdrawal from the eu are still unfolding and have impacted varying parts of its economy at different times since the withdrawal as the uk negotiates new trade deals and implements new laws and regulations following its withdrawal the uk’s actions could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses are subject including those involving data privacy and the regulation of medical devices the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free and timely movement of goods services people data and information and significantly disrupt trade further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economies and political stability of the uk eu and the other economies in which we operate 

should any of these factors either individually or in combination occur they could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate or may decrease due to a variety of factors including changing consumer demand inflation weakness in general economic conditions recessions and resistance to nontraditional treatment methods 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things pandemics inflation weakness in general economic conditions recessions levels of employment salaries and wage rates debt obligations discretionary income consumer confidence and consumer perception of current and future economic conditions declines in or uncertain economic outlooks for the us or certain international economies could adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic and dental case starts reduce patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduce or shift spending away from elective nonurgent or higher value procedures or reduce demand for dental services generally any of which could materially adversely affect our revenues and operating results conversely to the extent social distancing travel work and other restrictions have limited options for consumer spending demand for our products may decline once any or all of these restrictions ease inflation weakness in the global or regional economies and recessions can decrease demand for dental technologies causing dentists to postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners and cadcam software in addition invisalign treatment represents a significant change from traditional metal wires and brackets orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may not find it costeffective or preferable to traditional treatment for instance a number of dental professionals continue to believe the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of patients increased market acceptance of our products depends in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products and treatment methods 

our success depends on our ability to develop successfully introduce achieve market acceptance of and manage new products and services 

our success depends on our ability to profitably and quickly develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products and services along with improvements to existing products and services there is no assurance we can successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of our new products and services the extent of and rate at which new products or offerings may achieve market acceptance and penetration is a function of many variables including our ability to 

• successfully predict and timely innovate and develop new technologies and applications with the features and functionality customers desire or expect 

• successfully and timely obtain approval or clearance of new products or services from government agencies such as the fda and analogous agencies in other countries  

• cost effectively manufacture bring to market market and sell new products and services offerings 

• properly forecast the amount and timing of new product demand 

• allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects 

• ensure compatibility of our technology services and systems with those of our customers 

• anticipate and rapidly innovate in response to new competitive products product offerings and technologies 

• differentiate our products and product offerings from our competitors as well as other products in our own portfolio and successfully articulate the benefits to our customers 

• qualify for thirdparty reimbursement for procedures involving our products and 

• encourage customers to adopt new technologies and provide the needed technical sales and marketing support to make new product and services launches successful  

if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs doing so and our profitability may suffer it may be difficult to gain market share and acceptance for new or enhance products introduction and acceptance of new products may take significant time and effort if the products or services require doctor education and training to understand the benefits of the new products or they measure the success of a product only after using it to treat patients for instance it can take up to 24 months or longer to treat patients using our invisalign system consequently doctors may be unwilling to adopt our products until they successfully complete one or more cases or until more historical clinical results are available 

in addition as part of our effort to accommodate our customers’ needs and demands we periodically introduce new business and sales initiatives such as our commercial teeth whitening products announced in 2021 in general our internal resources support these new businesses or sales initiatives and we frequently provide such support without clear indications it will prove successful or be without shortterm execution challenges 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems personnel and suppliers in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we must continue implementing and improving our operational financial and management information systems hire train motivate manage and retain employees and ensure our suppliers remain diverse and capable of meeting growing demand for the systems raw materials parts and components essential to the manufacture and delivery of our products we may be unable to manage such growth effectively while balancing nearterm efforts to meet existing demand including adding personnel creating scalable secure and robust systems and operations and automating processes needed for long term efficiencies any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects 

we continue to establish treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to provide them with better experiences improve their confidence in using the invisalign system and itero intraoral scanners to treat more patients and provide redundancy should other facilities be temporarily or permanently unavailable our ability to obtain regulatory clearance and certifications for move into plan construct and equip additional facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks related to establishing facilities hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns any of which may be all or partially out of our control and can negatively impact our gross margin in addition operating facilities located in higher cost regions compared to mexico china and costa rica negatively impacts our gross margin if the construction or transition into additional facilities is significantly delayed if a facility is required to temporarily or permanently partially or fully shut down or demand for our products outpaces our ability to hire qualified personnel and effectively implement systems and infrastructure we may be unable to fulfill orders timely or at all which may negatively impact our financial results reputation and overall business 

in addition because adapting production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions takes time our facilities’ capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements for instance as a result of the covid19 pandemic sales in the final weeks of the first quarter of 2020 declined substantially and operations at our manufacturing facilities declined shortly thereafter then as dental practices reopened we experienced a rapid increase in demand these fluctuations in demand and sales have recurred several times since the first quarter of 2020 corresponding with increases in the number of people infected with covid19 and variants such as delta and omicron and may continue to arise in the future if product demand decreases or increases more than forecast we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges we may be required to purchase or lease additional or larger facilities and additional equipment or we may be unable to fulfill customer demand in the time frames and with the quantities required any of which may take time to accomplish lower our gross margin inhibit sales or harm our reputation additionally if we are required to implement new or modify existing health and safety protocols to safeguard our employees customers or their patients productivity could decline production of our clear aligners and intraoral scanners are also limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors including labor shortages shipping delays our dependency on thirdparty vendors for key materials parts components and equipment and limited production yields any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results 

our products and information technology systems are critical to our business issues with product development or enhancements it system integration implementation updates and upgrades along with security and data protection risks have previously and could again in the future disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient uninterrupted and secure operation of our own complex information technology systems “it systems” and are dependent on key software of third parties embedded in our products and it systems as well as thirdparty hosted it systems to support our operations all software and it systems are vulnerable to damage attack or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity including through the integration of acquired businesses which to date have been smaller organizations with lessmature or less sophisticated systems securities practices or training the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our operations and such systems and have increased the risk of security incidents to effectively manage our existing operations and continue to grow our it systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect enhance and restore existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and changing customer preferences expanded remote working and increased usage of online and hosted technology platforms by us our customers and suppliers have increased the demands on and risks to our it systems and personnel moreover we continue to transform certain business processes extend established processes to new subsidiaries andor implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning “erp” product development manufacturing and other software and it systems which entails certain risks including disruption of our operations such as our ability to develop and update products that are safe and secure track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data 

system upgrades development of new releases and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade and issue new releases of our products and customer facing software applications such as our itero intraoral scanners exocad cadcam solutions my itero our clincheck software myaligntech and the invisalign doctor site as well as our internal software applications upon which customer facing manufacturing and treatment planning operations are dependent software applications and products containing software frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions are released additionally the thirdparty software integrated into or interoperable with our products and services will routinely reach end of life and as a consequence certain models of our intraoral scanners may be exposed to additional vulnerabilities including increased security risks errors and malfunctions that may be irreparable or difficult to repair the discovery of a defect error or security vulnerability in our products software applications or it systems incompatibility with customers’ computer operating systems and hardware configurations with a new release or upgraded version or the failure of our products or primary it systems may cause adverse consequences including delay or loss of revenues significant remediation costs delay in market acceptance loss of data disclosure of financial health or other personal information of our customers or their patients product recalls damage to our reputation loss of market share or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a significant portion of our clear aligner production is dependent on digital scans from our itero and thirdparty intraoral scanners failures of all or any portion of ours or thirdparty software or other components or systems to interoperate with itero 

or thirdparty scanners termination of interoperability with thirdparty scanners malware or ransomware attacks product or system vulnerabilities or defects or a system outage for any reason have harmed our operations previously and in the future could affect materially and adversely our ability to accept scans manufacture clear aligners or restorative procedures or treatments and services or otherwise service our customers which may amongst other things harm our sales damage our reputation adversely impact our strategic partners or result in litigation 

additionally our globallydispersed installed base of itero intraoral scanners at customer strategic business partner or other locations may be independently or collectively the target of a cybersecurity incident or attack or subject to the intrusion of a virus bug or other similar negative intruder due to the large and growing number of these decentralized locations we may not be able to or not have the capacity knowledge or infrastructure to respond to or remedy a cybersecurity issue in a timely manner or sufficiently either of which may cause loss or damage to us or our customers or strategic business partners or may cause further malfunctions in or damage to our servers databases systems or products and services loss or damage of our data interruption or temporary cessation of our operations or an overall negative impact to our business or reputation 

if the information we rely on to run our businesses is inaccurate or unreliable or if the data governance controls in place fail or change or if compliance with such controls fails or if we fail to properly maintain secure or restore our it systems or if the integrity of our products or it systems is compromised or questioned or data is lost or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could suffer operational disruptions have customer disputes and fail to produce timely accurate or complete reports we may also be required to respond to regulatory inquiries or actions forced to defend against litigation or pay damages penalties or fines experience increases in operating and administrative expenses find it necessary to recall or repair products rebuild networks or systems lose existing customers or strategic business partners experience difficulties attracting new customers or implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the security features of our products it systems or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third parties and misappropriate destroy or damage our confidential information or that of third parties expose health financial data or other personal information of our customers and their patients create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects or present risks in design development manufacture or distribution including “bugs” security vulnerabilities and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system or compromise or exploit the safety and security of our products networks or data the costs to eliminate mitigate or recover from security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and depending on the nature and extent of the problem and the networks or products impacted may result in network or systems interruptions decreased product sales or data loss that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing or developing new products or it systems integrating new it systems protecting confidential patient health information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional product or it systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our products and it systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we are unable or fail to protect our customer or patient information or if we are unable to comply with applicable privacy security and data protection laws our operations may be severely adversely impacted patient care could suffer we could be liable for related damages and our business operations and reputation could be harmed 

we retain confidential customer financial as well as patient health information in addition to our own proprietary information and data essential to our business operations therefore it is critical that the facilities and infrastructure on which we depend to run our business and the products we develop remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security features in our products and security measures in our it systems our products as well as the infrastructure and it systems on which we depend are vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors or other technical malfunctions hacking or phishing attacks by third parties malware and ransomware employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems for example we have experienced cybersecurity incidents and may again in the future further the frequency of thirdparty cyber attacks has increased since the onset of the covid19 pandemic significant service disruptions breaches in our infrastructure and it systems or other cybersecurity incidents could expose us to litigation or regulatory investigations impair our reputation and competitive position be distracting to our management and require significant time and resources to address affected parties or regulatory agencies could initiate legal or regulatory action against us which could prevent us from resolving the issues quickly or in unanticipated ways cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in judicial or governmental orders forcing us to cease operations or modify our business practices in ways that could materially limit or restrict the products and services we provide concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others’ perception of us and deter customers patients and partners from using our products in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our products or it systems fail 

to deliver accurate and complete information in a timely manner we have cybersecurity and other forms of insurance coverage related to a breach event covering expenses for notification credit monitoring investigation crisis management public relations and legal advice the policy also provides coverage for regulatory action defense including oversight investigations and disclosure obligations as well as fines and penalties potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion however damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any coverage and do not cover the time and effort we incur investigating and responding to any incidents which may be significant 

we are also subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations including ones relating to privacy data security and protection content regulation and consumer protection among others we are subject to various national and regional data localization or data residency laws which generally require that certain types of data collected within a country be stored and processed only within that country or approved countries and other countries are considering enacting similar data localization or data residency laws we have and likely will again in the future be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols build new storage facilities andor devote additional resources to comply with such laws any of which could be costly we are also subject to data export restrictions and international transfer laws which prohibit or impose conditions upon the transfer of such data from one country to another these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted applied created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business 

in addition we must comply with numerous data privacy and data security requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us and china to multinational requirements in the eu for instance china has enacted complex and highly restrictive cybersecurity data localization and cross border data transfer laws in the eu we must comply with the general data protection regulation which serves as a harmonization of eu dataprivacy laws and in the us we must comply with data privacy and data security provisions of the us health insurance portability and accountability act regulations moreover the number of local and national governments enacting data privacy laws continues to increase and we expect this trend to continue maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers many of whom are comprised of individual or small operations with limited it experience and inadequate or untested security protocols in managing data privacy and data security requirements 

if we fail to sustain or increase revenue growth while controlling expenses our profitability may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we need to continue increasing our net revenues while controlling expenses because our business and the markets we target are evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth or declines we have not in the past and may be unable in the future to sustain or regain our historical growth rates which may cause our profitability to decline 

our operating results have and will continue to fluctuate in the future which makes predicting the timing and amount of our revenues costs and expenditures difficult 

our quarterly and annual operating results have and will continue to fluctuate for a variety of reasons including as a result of changing doctor and consumer product demand some of the factors that have historically and in the future could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

• limited visibility into and difficulty predicting from quarter to quarter the types of procedures and level of activities in our customers’ practices 

• fluctuations in the number of patients seeking treatment and the number of doctors providing services and treatment as a result of the pandemic and new variants in the virus 

• changes in demand based on geographies channels or product mix 

• the level of confidence of doctors in our products and changes in the rates at which they recommend or utilize our products for their patients 

• weakness in consumer spending and confidence inflation a slowdown or recession in domestic or international economies 

• higher manufacturing delivery and inventory costs 

• unanticipated delays and disruptions in the manufacturing process caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials parts or components shortages or turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes power outages or insufficient power natural or other disasters pandemics or general economic conditions impacting the solvency of vendors in our supply chain 

• competition in general and competitive developments in our target markets 

• new programs or business models new product or services introductions or changes or modifications to existing products and services offerings including any impacts related to the timing of orders product mix or market cannibalization 

• changes in relationships with dsos and distributors including the timing of orders 

• changes in the timing of revenue recognition and changes in our average selling prices including as a result of the timing of receipt of product orders and shipments product and services mix geographic mix product and services deferrals the introduction of new products and software releases product pricing bundling and promotions pricing for fees or expenses modifications to our terms and conditions such as payment terms or as a result of new accounting pronouncements or changes to critical accounting estimates including without limitation those estimates based on such matters as our predicted usage of additional aligners 

• the creditworthiness liquidity and solvency of our customers and their ability to timely make payments when due 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the us dollar 

• our inability to scale suspend or reduce production and treatment operations based on variations in product demand 

• seasonal fluctuations including those related to patient demographics such as the seasonality of teen treatments in the us china and europe as well as the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments 

• costs and expenditures in connection with such things as the establishment of new treatment planning and fabrication facilities the hiring and deployment of personnel and litigation and the success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter 

• timing and fluctuation of spending around marketing and brand awareness campaigns and industry trade shows 

• our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of subassemblies for our intraoral scanners 

• increased advertising or marketing efforts or aggressive price competition from competitors 

• changes to our effective tax rate 

• major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete 

• unanticipated delays or disruptions in our receipt of patient records made through intraoral scanners for any reason 

• disruptions to our business due to political economic or other social instability or any governmental regulatory or similar actions including the impact of epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits limiting or restricting patient visits to orthodontists or general practitioners as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism 

• inaccurate forecasting of net revenues production and other operating costs 

• investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements and 

• material impairments of goodwill and longlived assets 

to respond to these and other factors we may make business decisions that adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy and payment terms promotions development efforts product releases business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations for future revenues as a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below expectations we may be unable to timely or effectively reduce spending to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we do not believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are meaningful 

a disruption in the operations of a primary freight carrier higher shipping costs or shipping delays could disrupt our supply chain and cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to timely deliver our products to our customers who may choose alternative products causing our net revenues and gross margin to decline possibly materially when fuel costs increase our freight costs generally do so as well in addition we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales international sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to successfully pass all or significant portions of the increase along to our customers or we cannot otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

if we fail to accurately predict our volume growth hire too many or too few technicians or manufacture too many or too few products the delivery time for our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

if we fail to accurately predict our volume growth we may inaccurately estimate the staffing materials or storage required to manufacture our products if we underestimate volume growth our growth may exceed our manufacturing capacity of one or more of our suppliers or manufacturing facilities we may be understaffed and we may not have sufficient materials 

specifically our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer software and requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process often 120 days or longer as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may have an insufficient number of trained technicians to ensure products are manufactured and delivered within the time frames our customers expect without sufficient capacity trained personnel or materials we may be unable to provide our products to customers in a timely manner which could damage our relationships with our existing customers or harm our ability to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations 

conversely if we over estimate our growth we may have excess expenses caused by excess staffing materials and capacity if we hire and train too many technicians in anticipation of volume growth that does not materialize materializes at a rate slower than anticipated or if volumes decline our costs and expenditures may outpace our revenues or revenue growth harming our gross margin and financial results additionally in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer 

we are dependent on our marketing activities to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products which may not prove successful or may become less effective or more costly to maintain in the long term 

our marketing efforts and costs are significant and include national and regional campaigns in multiple countries involving television print media social media and more recently alliances with professional sports teams social media influencers and other strategic partners we attempt to structure our advertising campaigns to increase brand awareness adoption and goodwill however there is no assurance our campaigns will achieve the returns on advertising spend desired increase brand or product awareness sufficiently to sustain or increase our growth goals or generate goodwill and positive reputational goals moreover should any entity or individual endorsing us or our products take actions make or publish statements in support of or lend support to events or causes which may be perceived by all or any portion of society negatively our sponsorships or support of these entities or individuals may be called into question boycotts of our products announced and our reputation may be harmed any of which could have an adverse effect on our gross margin and business overall 

in addition various countries prohibit certain types of marketing activities for example some countries restrict direct to consumer advertising of medical devices we could run afoul of restrictions and be ordered to stop certain marketing activities moreover competitors do not always follow these restrictions creating an unfair advantage and making it more difficult and costly for us to compete 

additionally we rely heavily on data generated from our campaigns to target specific audiences and evaluate their effectiveness particularly data generated from internet activities on mobile devices to obtain this data we are dependent on third parties and popular mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems and mobile browsers any changes in such systems that degrade reduce or eliminate our ability to target or measure the results of ads or increase costs to target audiences could adversely affect the effectiveness of our campaigns for example apple has released mobile operating systems that include significant data privacy changes that may limit our ability to interpret target and measure ads effectively 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we fail to successfully obtain or enforce our intellectual property “ip” rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain existing ip rights and to obtain and maintain further ip protection for our products our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 

we rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and other countries to protect a large part of our ip and our competitive position however these patents may be insufficient to protect our ip rights because our patents may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products and foreign patents protections may be more limited than those provided under us patents and ip laws 

we may not be afforded the protection of a patent if our currently pending or future patent filings do not result in the issuance of patents or we fail to apply for patent protection we may fail to apply for a patent if our personnel fail to disclose or recognize new patentable ideas or innovations remote working can decrease the opportunities for our personnel to collaborate thereby reducing the opportunities for effective invention disclosures and patent application filings we may choose not to file a 

foreign patent application if the limited protections provided by a foreign patent outweigh the costs to obtain it our foreign patent portfolio is less extensive than our us portfolio 

we also rely on protection of our copyrights trademarks trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist when unauthorized uses or disclosures occur 

our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our ip rights might allow competitors to copy our technology or create counterfeit or pirated versions of our products which could adversely affect our reputation pricing and market share 

litigation interferences oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews or other proceedings have been necessary and will likely be needed in the future to determine the validity and scope of certain of our ip rights and the ip rights claimed by third parties to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products and the products of competitors asserting or defending these types of proceedings can be unpredictable protracted time consuming expensive and distracting to management and technical personnel the outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other ip rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for infringing products or technologies or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products or an exclusion order preventing us from importing our products in one or more countries moreover independent actions by competitors customers or others have been brought alleging that our efforts to assert or attempt to enforce our patent or other ip rights constitute unfair competition or violations of antitrust laws in the us and other jurisdictions and investigations and additional litigation based on the same or similar claims may be brought in the future the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

if we or any vendors on whose products or services we rely for our products and services infringe the patents or ip rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other ip rights is common in the medical device optical scanner 3d printing and other technologies and industries on which our products and services are based we have been sued for infringement of third parties’ patents in the past and we are currently defending patent infringement lawsuits and other legal claims in addition we periodically receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of ip lawsuits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any legal proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities exclusion orders or injunctions that may prevent or limit our rights to sell or import our products in one or more countries an adverse determination of this nature could require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

obtaining approvals and complying with governmental regulations particularly those related to personal healthcare information financial information quality systems and data privacy is expensive and timeconsuming and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals or comply with regulations regarding our products or services or the products and services of our suppliers or customers could materially harm our sales result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation 

as a supplier of medical devices and solutions we and many of our healthcare provider customers suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous federal state local and foreign laws including those regulating 

• the storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records 

• prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and 

• the marketing and advertising of our products 

the healthcare market itself is also highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences for instance regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information applicable to healthcare providers 

and their business associates such as hipaa may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants our critical vendors and service providers are similarly subject to various regulations our failure or the failure of our suppliers customers advertisers and influencers to strictly adhere to clearances or approvals in the labeling marketing and sales of our products and services could subject us to claims or litigation including actions alleging false or misleading advertising unfair or anticompetitive business practices or other violations of laws or regulations which may result in costly investigations fines penalties as well as material judgments settlements or decrees there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks associated with the implementation and compliance with such laws or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

furthermore in general before we can sell a new medical device or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain clearance or approval to gain market access unless an exemption applies for instance in the us fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

• product design development manufacturing and testing 

• product labeling 

• product storage 

• premarket clearance or approval 

• complaint handling and corrective actions 

• advertising and promotion and 

• product sales and distribution 

it takes significant time effort and expense to obtain and maintain fda clearances or approvals of products and services and there is no guarantee we will successfully or timely obtain or maintain approvals in all or any of the countries in which we do business now or in the future in other countries the requirements to obtain and maintain similar approvals may differ materially from those of the fda and may require additional time and expense moreover these laws may change resulting in additional time and expense or loss of approvals additionally the impact of the covid19 pandemic on normal governmental operations may delay our efforts to obtain and maintain approvals possibly significantly if approvals to market our products or services are delayed whether in the us or other countries we may be unable to offer them in markets we deem important to our business failure or delays to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals may materially harm our domestic or international operations and our business as a whole adversely impacted 

any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions in the us and other countries for example enforcement actions by the fda may include one or more of the following sanctions 

• warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties 

• repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products 

• operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production 

• refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products 

• withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals previously granted and 

• criminal prosecution 

we and certain of our vendors must also comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to satisfactorily correct an adverse inspection finding or to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement actions and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any enforcement action by the fda or foreign governments could have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition while we provide significant training to our personnel they may not properly adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations if our employees fail to comply with any or all laws or regulations or our policies or procedures it could result in violations of laws or regulations and subject us to harm to our reputation loss of customers loss or revenues or regulatory investigations and actions 

consequently if we cannot successfully obtain approval for our products or services or timely and costeffectively maintain compliance with laws regulating our products and services our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

we are highly dependent on thirdparty suppliers some of whom are sole source suppliers for certain key machines components and materials and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on our supply chain particularly manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners 

we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we rely on a single thirdparty manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our itero element scanner we purchase the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source by using single suppliers for materials and manufacturing in a limited number of locations we risk multiple supply chain vulnerabilities for example damage or destruction of a facility can materially disrupt our ability to timely deliver key components and materials or products or a supplier could encounter financial operating or other difficulties be unable to hire or maintain personnel fail to timely obtain supplies fail to maintain manufacturing standards or controls or fail to timely deliver materials parts or components any one of these occurrences would impact our supply chain 

restrictions in response to the pandemic and other macroeconomic factors have affected and are expected to continue to affect our supply chain the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including china a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through china and emea each of these areas has been affected by the pandemic and has implemented measures to try to contain its spread including restrictions on manufacturing facilities commerce travel our support operations and workforce and our customers strategic partners vendors and suppliers there is considerable uncertainty regarding the current and future impact of such measures including reduced availability or increased cost of air transport port closures and increased border controls and closures any or all restrictions can limit our manufacturers’ capacity to produce our parts or products and have a material adverse effect on our supply chain 

the effects of climate change on regional and global economies could change the supply demand or availability of sources of energy or other resources material to our products and operations and affect the availability or cost of natural resources and goods and services on which we and our suppliers rely 

because of our dependence on our suppliers changes in one or more of our relationships with them or changes in their circumstances can result in disruptions to the supply chain which can materially impact our business for instance we may be unable to quickly establish or qualify replacement suppliers creating production interruptions delays and inefficiencies finding substitute manufacturers may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of one or more products causing us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes in the event of technology changes delivery delays labor stoppages or shortages or shortages of or increases in price for these items sales may decrease and our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we rely on highly skilled personnel and i f we fail to attract motivate train or retain highly skilled personnel it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities 

we are highly dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled employees including orthodontists and production technicians in our treatment planning facilities and employees on our clinical engineering technology development and sales teams to be successful we must effectively manage our growth through our ability to identify hire develop motivate train and retain these skilled employees as well as personnel throughout our organization 

we provide significant training to our personnel and our business will be impacted if our training fails to properly prepare our personnel to perform the work required we are unable to successfully instill technical expertise in new and existing personnel or if our techniques prove unsuccessful or not costeffective 

moreover for certain roles this training and experience can make key personnel such as our sales personnel highly desirable by competitors and lead to increased attrition the loss of the services and knowledge from our highly skilled employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and business objectives and could harm our 

business for example it can take up to twelve months or more to train sales representatives to successfully market and sell our products and for them to establish strong customer relationships 

for more discussion related to our personnel and corporate culture see the risk factor “ we rely on our personnel and i f we fail to attract motivate or retain personnel or if our growth harms our corporate culture it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities” 

if we are unable to expand our workforce including key sales and other skilled personnel retain key personnel or quickly replace personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed 

we use distributors for a portion of the importation marketing and sales efforts related to our products and services which exposes us to risks that may be harmful to our sales and operations including that these distributors do not comply with applicable laws or our internal procedures 

in addition to our direct sales force we have and expect to continue to use distributors to import market sell service and support our products our agreements with these distributors are generally nonexclusive and terminable by either party with little notice if any of these relationships are terminated and if alternative distributors must be quickly found and trained in the use marketing sales and support of our products and services our revenues and ability to sell or service our products in markets key to our growth and expansion could be adversely affected these distributors may also choose to sell alternative or competing products or services in addition we may be held responsible for the actions of these distributors and their employees and agents for compliance with laws and regulations including fair competition bribery and corruption trade compliance and marketing and sales activities a distributor may also affect our ability to effectively market our products in certain foreign countries or regulatory jurisdictions if it holds the regulatory authorization in such countries or within such regions and causes by action or inaction the suspension of such marketing authorization or sanctions for noncompliance or prevents us from taking control of any such authorization it may be difficult expensive and timeconsuming for us to reestablish market access or regulatory compliance in such cases 

our business exposes us to potential liability for the quality and safety of our products and services how we advertise and market those products and services and how and to whom we sell them and we may incur substantial expenses or be found liable for substantial damages or penalties if we are subject to claims or litigation 

our products and services involve an inherent risk of claims concerning their design manufacture safety and performance how they are marketed and advertised in a complex framework of highly regulated domestic and international laws and regulations how we package bundle or sell them to customers who may be private individuals or companies or public entities such as hospitals and clinics and how we train and support doctors their staffs and patients who administer or use our products moreover consumer products and services are routinely subject to claims of false deceptive or misleading advertising consumer fraud and unfair business practices additionally we may be held liable if any product we develop or manufacture or services we offer or perform causes injury or is otherwise found unhealthy if our products are safe but they are promoted for use or used in unintended or unexpected ways or for which we have not obtained clearance or approvals “offlabel” usage we may be investigated fined or have our products or services enjoined or approvals rescinded or we may be required to defend ourselves in litigation although we maintain insurance for product liability business practices and other types of activities we make or offer coverage may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may be insufficient for actual liabilities any claim for product liability sales advertising and business practices regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs and damage our reputation increase our expenses and divert management’s attention 

compliance with current or future environmental social and governance “esg” laws may materially increase our costs expose us to potential liability and otherwise materially impact our business 

our operations are subject to a variety of existing local regional and global esg laws and regulations and we will likely be required to comply with new broader more complex and costly laws and regulations that focus on esg matters in the future our compliance obligations will likely span all aspects of our business and operations including product design and development materials sourcing and other procurement activities energy and natural resources usage facilities design and utilization recycling and collection transportation disposal activities and workers’ rights 

the environmental regulations related to greenhouse gases may have an impact on our or our suppliers’ energy sources many us and foreign regulators have enacted or are considering enacting new or additional limits on the emissions of greenhouse gases including but not limited to carbon dioxide and methane from power generation units using fossil fuels like 

coal and natural gas the effects of greenhouse gas emission limits on power generation that have been enacted already or that may be enacted in the future are subject to significant uncertainties including the timing of any new requirements and levels of emissions reductions initiatives and legislation designed to reduce restrict or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from power generation may have the effect of increasing our costs and those of our suppliers and could result in manufacturing transportation and supply chain disruptions and delays if clean energy alternatives are not readily available in adequate supply when required moreover alternative energy sources that supply the power to meet our current and future demands as well as those of our suppliers and the global and regional economies in general coupled with reduced investments in traditional energy sources and infrastructure may fail to provide the predictable reliable and consistent energy that we our suppliers and other businesses need for operations 

regulations related to sourcing of certain metals may have an impact on our business for instance the sourcing and availability of metals that may be used in the manufacture of or contained in our products may be affected by laws and regulations in the us or internationally regarding the use of minerals obtained from certain regions of the world like the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries although we do not believe that we or our suppliers source minerals from this region these laws and regulations may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices leading customers to potentially choose competitive goods and services 

meeting our obligations under existing laws rules or regulations is already costly to us and our suppliers and we expect those costs to increase in the future possibly materially additionally we expect regulators to perform investigations inspections and periodically audit our compliance with these laws and regulations and we cannot provide assurance that our efforts or operations will be compliant if we fail to comply with any requirements we could be subject to significant penalties or liabilities and we may be required to implement new and significantly more costly processes and procedures to come into compliance further these laws are subject to unpredictable changes even if we successfully comply with these laws and regulations our suppliers may fail to comply we may also suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free in all of these situations customers may stop purchasing products from us and may take legal action against us which could harm our reputation revenues and results of operations 

general risk factors 

we rely on our personnel and i f we fail to attract motivate or retain personnel or if our growth harms our corporate culture it may be more difficult to grow effectively and pursue our strategic priorities 

we believe a key factor in our success has been the culture we have created that emphasizes a shared vision and values focusing on agility customer success and accountability we believe this culture fosters an environment of integrity innovation creativity and teamwork we have also experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future difficulties attracting and retaining employees that meet the qualifications experience compliance mindset and values we expect if we are unable to attract and retain personnel that meet our selection criteria or relax our standards in order to meet the demands of our growth or if our growth is not managed effectively our corporate culture ability to achieve our strategic objectives and our compliance with obligations under our internal controls and other requirements may be harmed 

we are considering adjusting our remote working policies which may cause our culture to change cause us to incur additional costs or cause us to lose talent or fail to attract talent many of our employees have worked remotely during the covid19 pandemic which makes it difficult to maintain or enhance our culture especially for new employees onboarded remotely as we evaluate when and how to return employees to our offices globally we continue to assess the impact various returntooffice plans may have on our culture morale and hiring and retention particularly considering tight labor markets and generous or broad remote working policies being adopted by companies against whom we compete for talent should we choose to require employees to return to the office implement or modify a remote working policy andor allow or modify a hybrid approach in which employees can continue to work from home or other remote locations on a limited or part time basis only it may materially increase our costs or create unforeseen challenges or complications including 

• difficulties maintaining our corporate culture disruption of morale or decreased loyalty 

• negative impacts to collaboration performance and productivity 

• increased employee stress fatigue or “burn out” by employees unable to disengage their work life from the home life 

• increased operational governance compliance and tax risks 

• increased attrition or limits to our ability to attract employees who prefer for convenience or for safety reasons to continue working remotely full time or in offices or geographies different from where they were hired to work or are expected to work 

• problems managing office space requirements 

• concerns regarding favoritism or discrimination 

• strains to our business continuity plans and difficulties achieving our strategic objectives and 

• increased labor and employment claims and litigation 

furthermore our compensation and benefit arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating existing employees in addition other internal and external factors can impact our ability to hire and retain talent including insufficient advancement or career opportunities restrictive immigration policy and regulatory changes  an increase in employees choosing to retire or quit with no immediate intentions to continue working and significantly higher demand for technical and digital talent 

if we are unable to attract and retain personnel that meet our selection criteria or relax our standards in order to meet the demands of our growth or if our growth is not managed effectively our corporate culture ability to achieve our strategic objectives and our compliance with obligations under our internal controls and other requirements may be harmed 

business disruptions could seriously harm our financial condition 

our global operations have been disrupted in the past and will likely be disrupted and harmed again in the future the occurrence of any material or prolonged business disruptions could harm our growth and expansion result in significant losses seriously harm our revenues profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations 

human error can have a significant effect on our business while we train our employees and perform our due diligence when contracting with third parties mistakes and accidents still occur for instance in march 2021 a container ship carrying some of our products was stuck in the suez canal for six days although this did not have a material adverse effect on our business there is no assurance that such incidents may not impact us in a material way in the future 

natural disasters can impact our business including as a result of earthquakes tsunamis floods droughts hurricanes wildfires extreme weather conditions power outages restrictions and shortages telecommunications failures materials scarcity and price volatility and medical epidemics or health pandemics climate change is likely to increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and consequently risks to our operations and growth our digital dental modeling and certain of our customer facing operations are primarily processed in our facilities located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in mexico and china our locations in costa rica and mexico as well as others are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters moreover a significant portion of our research and development activities are located in california which suffers from earthquakes periodic droughts power shortages and wildfires if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our employees could be impacted our research could be lost and our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing significant delays receiving their aligners and a decrease in service levels 

when human induced or natural disasters occur they may individually or in the aggregate affect our ability to provide products services and solutions to our customers and could cause production delays or limitations create adverse effects on distributors disrupt supply chains result in shipping and distribution disruptions and reduce the availability of or access to one or more facilities any of which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies or in the way these policies are interpreted by us or regulators can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 

we are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such assessment may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether our internal control over financial reporting is effective our internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in personnel updates and upgrades to existing software including our erp software system changes in accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards 

and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and increases our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective the timely filing of our financial reports could be delayed or we could be required to restate past reports and cause us to lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in the future which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and inflation each of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the us dollar is our reporting currency a growing portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using constantly often substantially fluctuating exchange rates as a result negative movements in exchange rates against the us dollar have and may increasingly adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements we enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to currency fluctuations but there is no assurance these transactions will fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

we also experienced rising inflationary pressures in 2021 and expect such pressures to continue in 2022 cost inflation including increases in ocean container rates raw material prices labor rates and domestic transportation costs threaten to impact our profitability and our ability to recover these cost increases through price increases may continue to lag resulting in downward pressure on our gross margin and operating margin any attempts to offset cost increases with price increases may result in reduced sales increase customer dissatisfaction or otherwise harm our reputation 

if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risks successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we are required to write down the value of the investment which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in an unstable credit or economic environment it is necessary to assess the value of our investments more frequently and we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

additionally in july 2017 the united kingdom financial conduct authority announced that it would stop compelling banks to submit interest rates for the calculation of the london interbank offered rate “libor” after 2021 although we do not have any outstanding debt under our 2020 credit facility were we to draw on it the outstanding amounts would bear interest at fluctuating interest rates on an approved replacement benchmark we also have other contracts indexed to libor we continue to monitor this matter and evaluate the related risks and potential impact of libor’s expiration any indebtedness that we incur may be indexed to a replacement benchmark such as the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” any such change could cause the effective interest rate under an agreement including our 2020 credit facility and our overall interest expense to increase adversely affecting our cash flows and results of operations 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under gaap we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired and assessing these assumptions and predicting and forecasting future events can be difficult goodwill and purchased assets require periodic fair value assessments to determine if they have become impaired consequently we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or longlived asset group is determined 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in the global economic environment changes in legal entity structure or activities performed within our entities changes in tax laws regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changes in overall levels of pretax earnings the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and nondeductible goodwill impairments for example our effective tax rate varied significantly in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the relocation of our emea regional headquarters from the netherlands to switzerland 

our effective tax rate is also dependent in part on forecasts of full year results which can vary materially furthermore we may continue to experience significant variation in our effective tax rate related to excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation particularly in the first quarter of each year when the majority of our equity awards vest 

new tax laws and practice changes to existing tax laws and practice or disputes regarding the positions we take regarding tax laws could negatively affect our provision for income taxes as well as our ongoing operations 

as a us multinational corporation we are subject to tax laws both within and outside of the us and significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes changes in tax laws or changes to how those laws are applied to our business in practice could affect the amount of tax to which we are subject and the manner in which we operate additionally the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project has resulted in considerable new reporting obligations worldwide as oecd member countries have implemented its guidance the oecd continues to publish guidance pursuant to the beps and other projects which if adopted by member countries may affect our tax positions in many of the countries in which we do business 

moreover the application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax “sut” valueadded tax “vat” goods and services tax “gst” and other indirect taxes to our operations is complex and evolving us states local and foreign taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing differing types of taxes and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations and exemptions that may change over time we collect and remit sut vat gst and other taxes in many jurisdictions and we are routinely subject to audits the positions we take regarding taxes as well as the amounts we collect or remit may be challenged and we may be liable for failing to collect or remit all or any portion of taxes deemed owed or the taxes could exceed our estimates one or more us states or countries may seek to impose incremental or new sales use or other tax collection obligations on us or may determine that such taxes should have but have not been paid by us 

we are routinely subject to audits regarding our tax reporting and remissions by local and national governments we may also be subject to audits in us states local and foreign jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities the positions we take and assumptions we make regarding taxes as well as the amounts we collect or remit may be challenged and we may be liable for failing to collect or remit all or any portion of taxes deemed owed or the taxes could exceed our estimates if we dispute rulings or positions taken by tax authorities we may incur expenses and expend significant time and effort to defend our positions which may be costly 

the application of existing new or future tax laws and results of audits whether in the us or internationally could harm our business furthermore there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the various tax requirements and defending our positions in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business 

we have in the past and may again in the future invest in or acquire other businesses products or technologies which may require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations 

periodically we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies products or technologies like our acquisition of exocad in 2020 alternatively we may be unable to find suitable investment or acquisition targets in the future and we may not be able to complete investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do make investments or complete acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals or desired synergies and any investments that we make or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers securities analysts and investors moreover to the extent we make strategic investments the companies in which we invest may fail or we may ultimately own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of the company and be outvoted on critical matters or issues that could harm us or the value of our investment 

additionally as an organization we do not have a history of significant acquisitions or integrating their operations and cultures with our own as such we are subject to multiple vulnerabilities and risks when making a strategic investment or acquisition including we may 

• fail to perform proper due diligence and inherit or fail to uncover material issues of the acquired company or assets including ip or other litigation or ongoing investigations accounting irregularities or improprieties bribery corruption or other compliance liabilities 

• fail to comply with regulations governmental orders or decrees 

• create it security and privacy compliance issues 

• invest in companies that generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop 

• not realize a positive return on investment or determine that our investments have declined in value such that we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

• have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition adversely affecting our liquidity financial condition or the value of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any acquisition could result in dilution to our stockholders the occurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations 

• find it difficult to implement and harmonize companywide financial reporting forecasting and budgeting accounting billing information technology and other systems due to inconsistencies in standards internal controls procedures and policies 

• require significant time and resources to effectuate the transition 

• fail to retain key personnel 

• inaccurately forecast the financial impact of an acquired business 

• not realize any or all or material portions of the expected synergies and benefits of the acquisition or 

• unsuccessfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or acquired company’s knowhow or fail to successfully integrate any acquisitions or the technologies acquired 

moreover opposition to one of more acquisitions could lead to negative ratings by analysts or investors give rise to objections by one or more stockholders or result in stockholder activism any of which could harm our stock price acquisitions can also lead to large noncash charges that can have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of writeoffs for items such as future impairments of intangible assets and goodwill or the recording of stockbased compensation 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock is subject to rapid and wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

• the impact on global and regional economies as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity or changes in our forecasts and guidance 

• changes in recommendations by the investment community or speculation in the press or investment community regarding estimates of our net revenues operating results or other performance indicators 

• announcements by us or our competitors or new market entrants including strategic actions management changes and material transactions or acquisitions 

• technical factors in the public trading markets for our stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro industry or companyspecific fundamentals including without limitation the sentiment of retail investors including as it may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites the amount and status of short interest in our securities access to margin debt trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock fractional share trading and other technical trading factors or strategies 

• announcements regarding stock repurchases sales of our common stock credit agreements and debt issuances 

• announcements of technological innovations new additional or revised programs business models products or product offerings by us our customers or competitors 

• key decisions in pending litigation new litigation settlements judgments or decrees 

• sales of stock by us our officers or directors and 

• general economic market conditions 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may include market expectations of or actual changes in monetary policies that have the goal of easing or tightening interest rates such as the federal funds rate in the us and austerity measures of governments intended to control budget deficits historically our stock has fluctuated materially based on broad 

economic and industry factors unrelated to our actual performance and future changes in monetary policies austerity and other market factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically securities litigation including securities class action lawsuits and securities derivative lawsuits is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have not been excepted from such litigation 

we cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase our common stock in the future and any repurchases that we may make may not achieve our desired objectives 

we have a history of recurring stock repurchase programs intended to return capital to our investors future stock repurchase programs are contingent on a variety of factors including our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors continuing determination that stock repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements there is no assurance that we will continue repurchasing our common stock in the future consistent with historical levels or at all or that our stock repurchase programs will have a beneficial impact on our stock price 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock by creating the perception of difficulties or problems with our business that may depress our stock price 

increased scrutiny of our esg policies and practices have and will likely continue to result in additional costs and risks and may adversely impact our reputation employee retention and willingness of customers and suppliers to do business with us 

investor advocacy groups institutional investors investment funds proxy advisory services stockholders and customers are increasingly focused on esg practices of companies additionally public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ esg practices continues to grow if our esg practices fail to meet regulatory requirements or investor or other industry stakeholders evolving expectations and standards for responsible corporate citizenship in areas including environmental stewardship support for local communities board of director and employee diversity human capital management employee health and safety practices product quality supply chain management corporate governance and transparency and employing esg strategies in our operations our brand reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted and customers and suppliers may be unwilling to do business with us in addition as we work to align our esg practices with industry standards we have expanded and in the future will likely continue to expand our disclosures in these areas we also expect to incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor report and comply with our various esg practices if we fail to adopt esg standards or practices as quickly as stakeholders desire or regulators require report on our esg efforts or practices accurately or satisfy the disclosure and other expectations of stakeholders or regulators our reputation business financial performance growth and stock price may be adversely impacted

• our growth depends on the continued penetration and adoption of invisalign products intraoral scanners and cadcam solutions in international markets we continue to invest in manufacturing operations research and development clinical treatment planning sales and marketing and building our quality and regulatory capabilities in existing and emerging markets globally for instance in 2021 we 

◦ opened new offices in israel to support the longterm growth of itero scanner and services business for treatment planning and other operations 

◦ announced plans to open an aligner fabrication facility in wroclaw poland as a part of our strategy to bring operational facilities closer to customers and thereby serve them more quickly and respond to their needs more effectively as well as new treatment planning operations in targeted regional geographies and 

◦ expanded our sales and marketing efforts into new countries and regions including establishing offices in the african countries of ghana and morocco 

• we continue to see growth opportunities with international orthodontists and gp customers particularly with adopters of digital dentistry platforms as we continue to tailor our sales and marketing strategies and resources around the unique needs of each customer channel as we continue growing we intend to opportunistically expand our research development manufacturing treatment planning sales and marketing operations to meet local and regional demand thoughtfully and deliberately over the longerterm we expe ct international revenues to grow faster than americas revenues as a result of growing international demand our continued investment in international market expansion the size of the market opportunities and our relatively low market penetration of these regions 

• we believe our training and education efforts are important to building the confidence within the gp and orthodontic communities needed to increase their adoption and utilization of clear aligner treatment accordingly we continue to expand our invisalign customer base by educating new doctors on the benefits of digital dentistry through the invisalign system and demonstrating to gps and orthodontists how the itero portfolio of intraoral scanners and cadcam restorative services and workflows can increase the profitability of their dental practices by enhancing patient experiences 

however training and education alone are insufficient to drive adoption and utilization growth sufficiently we need to continue to innovate develop and bring to market products and solutions that deliver the everincreasing clinical precision and predictability doctors expect with the speed and convenience their patients require for this reason we expect to continue to invest in research and development and open facilities closer to our customers and their patients to timely and conveniently support them 

• patient demand and conversion depends on making targeted investments in advertising and public relations through social media influencers and other forms of digital communications to encourage patients to seek treatment from invisalign trained doctors we believe that welldesigned targeted sales and marketing promotions that build on our strong brand awareness and allow us to differentiate our products and solutions from traditional and emerging competitors accordingly we continue to increase investments intended to grow consumer demand for instance in 2021 we introduced the “invisis” consumer advertising campaign with new creative content and influencers focused on teens moms and young adults we expect to make further investments to create additional demand for invisalign system treatment driving more consumers to dental professionals for those treatments 

in addition we are pursuing new lines of consumer products that are complementary to our doctorprescribed principal products currently available in certain ecommerce channels in the us similarly in order to grow our retainer business which is significantly underpenetrated we have begun investing more directly in marketing strategies focused on driving adoption and increasing market share in the us 

• we expect global orthodontic utilization rates to continue increasing overall as doctors’ clinical confidence in the efficacy and predictability of the invisalign system increases with advancements in products and technology and as patients and doctors demand treatments that emphasize convenience and safety through fewer in office visits and less invasive and quicker treatments rise in addition the teenage and younger market makes up 75 of the approximately 21 million total annual global orthodontic case starts each year as we continue to emphasize the benefits of the invisalign system for teenage and younger patient treatments through education training and sales and marketing programs we expect utilization rates to rise however our utilization rates will fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors which may include seasonal trends in our business office closures or slowdowns related to covid19related preventative measures and adoption rates for new products and features refer to “ covid19 pandemic update ” below for further details 

• to achieve these strategic pillars we expect to continue hiring skilled employees in our clinical engineering technology development manufacturing sales and management teams expanding our workforce will require that we offer competitive compensation and result in increasing costs which we expect to offset with increasing revenues 

covid19 pandemic update 

the covid19 pandemic continues to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in the global and regional economies leading to changes in consumer and business behavior fear and market fluctuations materials and product shortages and restrictions on business and individual activities all of which is materially impacting supply and demand in broad sectors of the world markets during 2021 many businesses and countries including the us continued imposing preventative and precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of the virus and its variants as a result of the restrictive measures imposed the 

demand for digital solutions has increased society and businesses continue to adapt to practices such as social distancing and remote working that further the need for greater flexibility and convenience of digital solutions our efforts to promote the digital transformation of dental practices with our clear aligners intraoral scanners clinical treatment planning and other offerings has allowed us to quickly respond to fluctuating demands in the dental field in various regions 

consequently despite the economic challenges caused by the pandemic our revenue grew by 599 in 2021 compared to 2020 the growth was a combination of noncovid related increases as well as lower revenues in 2020 as the initial preventative measures to combat the spread of the virus resulted in significant office closures and materially reduced operating capacities for many of our customers our overall business performance has been strong and we believe the digital transition to dentistry that began before the pandemic will continue to be positive for our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition although we intend to adjust spending to coincide with the fluctuating pace of recovery and changes in demand as such our recent operating results and levels of growth may not be indicative of our future performance 

the continuing evolution of the pandemic remains highly fluid and unpredictable including the setbacks occurring as a result of new virus strains and new or additional operating restrictions imposed on businesses supply chain shortages and delays the positive impacts of vaccinations the uncertainties regarding consumer spending as demand for entertainment dining and travel returns and remote working diminishes our top priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees and their families our customers and their staff in addition new variants of the virus have caused unpredictable fluctuations in the number of patients seeking treatment and the number of doctors providing the services and treatments these fluctuations have adversely impacted our results of operations from time to time in the recent past and are expected to continue to impact our results particularly in the near term 

we continue to follow recommended safety measures including encouraging employees to work from home when possible suspending nonessential work travel and implementing various access controls at our facilities in order to overcome the supply chain shortages and delays we are also proactively communicating with our suppliers and distributors and modifying our purchase order commitments to mitigate the risks of supply chain interruptions and maintaining inventory levels greater than historically required

other statistical data and trends 

• our primary goal is to establish clear aligners as the principal solution for the treatment of malocclusions and our invisalign system as the treatment solution of choice by orthodontists gps and patients globally our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital dental scans and our exocad cadcam software as the solution of choice for dental labs as of december 31 2021 over 12 million people worldwide have been treated with our invisalign system over 68000 itero scanners have been sold and over 47000 exocad software licenses have been installed management measures these results by comparing to the estimated 500 million people who can benefit from straighter teeth 21 million annual orthodontic case starts and 2 million dental practices that could use intraoral scanners and uses this data to target opportunities to expand the market for orthodontics by educating consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using the invisalign system dental professionals andor labs and service providers to use itero intraoral scanners and dental labs and practitioners to install exocad cadcam software 

• for the fourth quarter of 2021 total invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the americas increased to 891 up from 840 in the fourth quarter of 2020 and international scans increased to 808 up from 737 in the fourth quarter of 2020 for the fourth quarter of 2021 964 of invisalign cases submitted by north american orthodontists were submitted digitally our annual utilization rates for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

 invisalign utilization rates are calculated by the number of cases shipped divided by the number of doctors to whom cases were shipped our international region includes emea apac latin america  “ latam ”  is excluded from the international region based on its immateriality to the year however is included in the total utilization 

• total utilization rate in 2021 increased to 208 cases per doctor compared to 161 cases per doctor in 2020 and 159 cases per doctor in 2019

provision for benefit from income taxes in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily attributable to the recognition of tax benefits associated with the intraentity transfer of certain intellectual property rights and fixed assets during the year ended december 31 2020 

during 2020 we completed an intraentity transfer of certain intellectual property rights and fixed assets to our swiss entity the transfer of intellectual property rights did not result in a taxable gain however it did result in a stepup of the swiss tax deductible basis in the transferred assets and accordingly created a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of such intellectual property rights consequently this transaction resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset and related onetime tax benefit of approximately 14935 million during the year ended december 31 2020 which is the net impact of the deferred tax asset recognized as a result of the additional swiss tax deductible basis in the transferred assets and certain costs related to the transfer of fixed assets and inventory the amortization of this deferred tax asset depends on the 

profitability of our swiss headquarters and the recognition of this tax benefit is allowed for a maximum recovery period of 15 years

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making the estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8  

revenue recognition 

our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of aligners scanners and services from our clear aligner and systems and services segments we enter into sales contracts that may consist of multiple distinct performance obligations where certain performance obligations of the sales contract are not delivered in one reporting period we measure and allocate revenues according to asc 60610 “ revenues from contracts with customers ” 

determining the standalone selling price “ssp” allocation of consideration from the contract to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition is the result of significant qualitative and quantitative judgments while changes in the allocation of the ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenues recognized for a particular contract any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition which would have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations this is because the contract consideration is allocated to each performance obligation delivered or undelivered at the inception of the contract based on the ssp of each distinct performance obligation 

we allocate revenues for each clear aligner treatment plan based on each unit’s ssp management considers a variety of factors such as same or similar product historical sales costs and gross margin which may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation in making these estimates for treatment plans with multiple future performance obligations we also consider usage rates which is the number of times a customer is expected to order more aligners after the initial shipment our process for estimating usage rates requires significant judgment and evaluation of inputs including historical usage data by region country and channel 

we estimate the ssp of each element in a scanner system and services sale taking into consideration same or similar product historical prices as well as our discounting strategies 

unfulfilled performance obligations for clear aligners and scanners 

the estimated revenues expected to be recognized in the future related to our unfulfilled performance obligations including deferred revenues and backlog as of december 31 2021 is 13073 million this estimate includes both product and service unfulfilled performance obligations and the time range reflects our best estimate of when we will transfer control to the customer and may change based on customer usage patterns timing of shipments readiness of customers facilities for installation and manufacturing availability all of which involve significant judgement generally our deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of one to five years  

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets 

goodwill and acquired intangible assets with finite lives are subject to impairment testing and are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of these identifiable intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from such assets if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges 

assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our acquired intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and internal forecasts our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in impairment charges in the future 

if we were to have impairments to goodwill or finitelived acquired intangible assets it could adversely affect our operating results during the fiscal year 2021 and 2020 we did not have any impairment charges related to our goodwill or acquired intangible assets 

accounting for income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of us gaap and complex domestic and international tax laws related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of both of our historical and future performance as well as other relevant factors realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income which is determined based on assumptions such as estimated growth rates in revenues gross margins future cash flows and discount rates the accuracy of these estimates could be affected by unforeseen events or actual results and the sustainability of our future tax benefits is dependent upon the acceptance of these valuation estimates and assumptions by the taxing authorities 

accounting for legal proceedings and litigation 

estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict and therefore the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates consequently new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition which is incorporated herein 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations in addition we are subject to the broad market risk that is created by the global market disruptions and uncertainties resulting from the covid19 pandemic further discussion of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors”  

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 1973 million invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure based on interest bearing liabilities we have as of december 31 2021 we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we generally sell our products in the local currency of the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are generally denominated in their local currencies regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 

we primarily enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the gains and losses on these forward contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being economically hedged these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally are one month in original maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes as our international operations grow we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates it is difficult to predict the impact forward contracts could have on our results of operations 

although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use forward contracts to minimize the effect of these fluctuations the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

we have two operating segments 1 clear aligner and 2 imaging systems and cadcam services “systems and services” for the year ended december 31 2020 clear aligner net revenues represented approximately 85 of worldwide net revenues while systems and services net revenues represented the remaining 15 of worldwide net revenues we sell the majority of our products directly through a dedicated and specialized sales force to our customers orthodontists general practitioner dentists “gps” restorative and aesthetic dentists including prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons and dental laboratories we also sell through noninventory carrying sales agents and distributors in certain countries in addition we sell directly to dental support organizations “dsos” who contract with dental practices to provide critical business management and support including nonclinical operations and we sell products used by dental laboratories who manufacture or customize a variety of products used by licensed dentists to provide oral health care 

we received 510k clearance from the united states food and drug administration “fda” to market the invisalign system in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device in order to provide invisalign treatment to their patients orthodontists and gps must initially complete an invisalign training course 

our itero intraoral scanner is used by dental professionals andor labs and service providers for restorative and orthodontic digital procedures as well as invisalign case submissions we received 510k clearance from the fda to market itero software for expanded indications in 2013 our systems and services products are primarily sold through our direct sales force and through noninventory carrying sales agents and distributors in certain countries and directly to dsos 

in april 2020 we completed the acquisition of privatelyheld exocad global holdings gmbh “exocad” a german dental cadcam software company that offers fully integrated workflows to dental labs and dental practices we acquired exocad for its expertise in restorative dentistry implantology guided surgery and smile design to extend the invisalign system and itero digital solutions and pave the way for new crossdisciplinary dentistry in labs and at chairside exocad now has over 200 partners and more than 40000 software licenses installed worldwide 

clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting billions of people or approximately 60 to 75 of the global population annually approximately 15 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and may be augmented with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer appliance of the 15 million annual global orthodontic cases started we estimate that approximately 90 or 135 million could be treated using our invisalign clear aligners in addition globally approximately 500 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth this represents a significant opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by training more doctors including gp dentists as well as orthodontists and educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using the invisalign system and connecting them with an invisalign doctor of their choice 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computersimulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear polymer removable aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and access to proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

diagnosis and transmission of treatment data  an invisalign system trained dental professional prepares an online prescription form on our invisalign doctor site and submits the patients records which include a digital intraoral scan or a polyvinylsiloxane “pvs” impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition intraoral digital scans may be submitted through align’s itero scanner or certain thirdparty scanners capable of accurately interfacing with our systems and processes see “third party scanners and digital scans” more than 79 of invisalign system case submissions are now submitted via digital scan increasing the accuracy of 

treatments reducing the time from prescription submission to patient receipt and decreasing the carbon footprint resulting from the shipment of the materials used to form pvs impressions to the doctors and shipping those pvs impressions back to us 

computersimulated treatment plan  using the information certain doctor preferences and digital data provided we generate a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck ® treatment plan using proprietary software we have developed through significant ongoing investments over more than 20 years a patient’s clincheck treatment plan simulates desired tooth movement in stages and details the timing and placement of any features or attachments to be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to affect the desired movements 

review and approval of the treatment plan by an invisalign trained doctor the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via align’s invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to evaluate projected tooth movement from initial position to final position and compare multiple treatment plan options by reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control of the patient’s treatment 

manufacture of custom aligners following the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation as input for the next stage in which we use stereolithography technology a form of 3d printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear polymer removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the patients clincheck treatment plan 

shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear once manufactured in most countries all the aligners for a patients treatment plan are shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals aligners are generally worn for a short period of time corresponding to the stages of the patient’s approved clincheck treatment plan the patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement through each stage at various points in each patient’s treatment their doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and the approved clincheck treatment plan at the treating doctor’s discretion weekly aligner changes are recommended for all invisalign treatments except for express packages and may provide shorter treatment time compared with twoweek aligner wear 

feature enhancements 

we continually introduce enhanced features across our digital platform that includes our invisalign system itero intraoral scanners exocad cadcam solutions and digital workflows to improve treatment outcomes address broader clinical indications or respond to customer demand 2020 saw a number of new innovations intended to enhance the ease by which doctors can diagnose plan and treat patients more efficiently and effectively many of which became critically important to patient care in the wake of limited inperson visits as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition to other examples referenced throughout this annual report on form 10k in 2020 align launched the following products 

• invisalign virtual appointment and invisalign virtual care  two continuity of care virtual solutions generally released in may 2020 that offer practice and care transformation to doctors by enabling a range of remote practice services for their patients such as video appointments and care and treatment progress reviews and communications 

• clincheck 60 pro software  released in the third quarter of 2020 clincheck pro 60 software is the latest release of align ’s proprietary 3d treatment planning software showing the planned tooth movements throughout a patient’s invisalign treatment now more broadly available to doctors on multiple devices at any time via the cloud clincheck pro 60 software also included the clincheck “inface” visualization tool enhancing the digital treatment planning experience for doctors and their patients by incorporating a frontfacing image of a patient’s face into their 3d clincheck treatment plan to create a personalized view of how their new smile could look with invisalign system treatment 

• invisalign stickables  released in the third quarter of 2020 invisalign stickables are sticker accessories designed exclusively for use with our patented smarttrack® material in invisalign clear aligners to personalize invisalign clear aligners invisalign stickables are available in an array of designs colors shapes and themes and allow patients to show their personal flair during invisalign system treatment in fun and engaging ways 

clear aligner products 

we offer our invisalign clear aligner products in a variety of treatment packages designed to correspond with the casebycase treatment needs of our doctors and their patients the table below provides a general description of the types of treatment products we offer in various regions as they typically correspond to the severity of malocclusion and length of anticipated treatment 



most of our invisalign system treatment plans described above provide dental professionals with the option to order additional aligners if the patients treatment deviates from the original treatment plan the number and timing of additional aligner orders are subject to certain requirements noted in our terms and conditions 

comprehensive products  invisalign treatment options 

invisalign comprehensive packages  the invisalign comprehensive package is used to treat adults and teens for a full spectrum of mild to severe malocclusion and contains a wide variety of invisalign features to address the doctors treatment goals it also addresses the frequently complex orthodontic needs of teenage or younger patients with advanced features such as mandibular advancement compliance indicators and compensation for tooth eruption these packages include invisalign comprehensive invisalign first phase 1 and invisalign first comprehensive phase 2 

invisalign first phase 1 and invisalign first comprehensive phase 2 packages  invisalign first phase 1 package is designed specifically for younger patients generally between the ages of seven and ten years who frequently have a mixture of primarybaby and permanent teeth invisalign first phase 1 treatment provides early interceptive orthodontic treatment traditionally done through arch expanders or partial metal braces before all permanent teeth have erupted invisalign first phase 1 clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients malocclusions including shorter clinical crowns management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion our invisalign first comprehensive phase 2 package is a continuation of invisalign first phase 1 and is generally consistent with our invisalign comprehensive package after a patient completes invisalign first phase 1 doctors have the option to purchase a discounted comprehensive phase 2 package for that same patient 

noncomprehensive products  invisalign treatment options 

invisalign noncomprehensive packages we offer a variety of lower priced treatment packages for less complex orthodontic cases noncomprehensive relapse cases or straightening prior to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers these treatment packages include invisalign express lite go go plus and moderate these packages may be offered in select countries andor may differ from region to region

retention  we offer up to four sets of custom clear aligners called vivera retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse if necessary retainers are generally available for doctors to offer to any of their patients whether they use the invisalign system or other products including wires and brackets in select markets we also offer single set retainers 

smarttrack aligner material 

smarttrack clear aligner material is a patented customengineered invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of their energy in the initial days of wear but smarttrack material maintains more constant force over time the flexible smarttrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment 

in october 2020 we introduced invisalign g8 with smartforce aligner activation a clear aligner biomechanical innovation that allows doctors to more predictably treat crowding crossbite and deep bite cases through the targeted application of force to teeth through surface contours on the aligners that help control the location direction and intensity of tooth movement 

systems and services segment 

intraoral scanning is a rapidly evolving technology that is having a substantial impact on the practice of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of a patients teeth digital scan using a handheld intraoral scanner digital scanning is faster more efficient precise and comfortable for patients beginning patient care with the early usage of our itero intraoral scanners and combining the results with digital workflows designed to assist doctors and patients visualize and evaluate various treatment options with detailed imagery and cadcam solutions is helping improve treatments outcomes and satisfaction the accuracy of digitally scanned models substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes meaning patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments increasing overall patient satisfaction digital models also reduce the carbon footprint associated with the shipping of the materials used to create pvs impressions the shipping of those impressions and their disposal moreover the digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments digital records storage aid to caries detection orthodontic diagnosis orthodontic retainers and appliances and invisalign digital impression submission 

itero scanner  the itero element scanner is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures the expanded portfolio includes the itero element 2 the itero element flex itero element 5d imaging system and itero element plus series of intraoral scanners which are each available in select regions and countries these products build on the existing high precision fullcolor imaging and fast scan times of the itero element portfolio while streamlining orthodontic and restorative workflows the itero scanner is interoperable with our invisalign treatment such that a full arch or full mouth digital scan can be submitted as part of the invisalign system case submission process 

in february 2019 we launched the itero element 5d imaging system which provides a new comprehensive approach to clinical applications workflows and user experience that expands the suite of existing highprecision fullcolor imagining and fast scan times of the itero element scanner portfolio and in march 2020 we received us fda 501k clearance for the system in addition to offering all of the features and functionality of the itero element 2 scanner the itero element 5d scanner is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3d intraoral color and nearinfrared “niri” imaging and enables comparison over time using the itero timelapse technology niri technology included in our intraoral scanners like the itero element 5d imaging system aids in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions above the gingiva without using harmful radiation the itero element 5d imaging system is available in the majority of north america emea and select apac and latam countries and is pending regulatory approval in others 

we also recently announced the launch of the itero element plus series next generation of scanners and imaging systems featuring advanced technology and capabilities designed to improve the scanning experience and increase practice productivity the itero element plus series offers faster processing times and advanced visualization capabilities in an ergonomically designed package available in both cart and mobile configurations for greater practice flexibility

manufacturing and suppliers 

we have manufacturing facilities located in juarez mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribution repair of our itero scanners and perform certain cadcam services and in ziyang china where we fabricate aligners primarily for the china and apac markets in addition we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand perform final scanner assembly and repair our scanners at our facilities in or yehuda israel and ziyang china we also perform digital treatment planning and interpretation for restorative cases based on digital scans generated by our itero intraoral scanners our digital treatment planning facilities are located worldwide including in costa rica china and other international locations information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capacity and capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual 

and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single or sole source suppliers we also currently purchase our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source a discussion of the risks of our supply and manufacturing operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  risk factors 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused on increasing adoption and utilization of the invisalign system by orthodontists and gps worldwide and integrating the itero scanner and exocad cadcam products into dental labs and practices the scanner is an important component to the customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of invisalign treatments in each region we have direct sales and support organizations which include quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration we also have distribution partners in certain markets our sales and marketing personnel are organized to support orthodontists and gp dentists separately allowing highly trained and specialized personnel to serve each customer category thereby increasing our focus and effectiveness on both we continue to expand in existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in select countries 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 102000 active invisalign trained doctors which we define as having submitted at least one case in the prior 12month period 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital dental scans 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms these activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate the broad treatment capabilities of the invisalign system various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign treatment to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process we furthermore fund research in the field of orthodontics and dentistry through initiatives such as our annual research award program which was in its 11th year in 2020 and our partnership with medtech innovator asia pacific a nonprofit startup accelerator for the medical technology industry that connects healthcare industry leaders with innovative medical technology startups for mentorship and support 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property portfolio represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2020 we had 553 active us patents 592 active foreign patents and 648 pending global patent applications our active us patents expire between 2021 and 2039 when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided which could negatively impact our operating results however we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we furthermore have a broad and diverse trademark portfolio that we use to highlight and protect our universally recognized brands information regarding risks associated with our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we have historically experienced seasonal trends within our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve sales of invisalign treatments are often weaker in europe during the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday and seasonally higher in china during the third quarter particularly related to increased teen cases similarly other international holidays like lunar new year can also negatively impact our sales in apac in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our systems and services segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates moreover the covid19 pandemic has disrupted many seasonal patterns and it remains unclear when or if they will return to historical norms 

competition 

our clear aligner products compete directly against traditional treatments using metal brackets and wires and increasingly against clear aligner products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us we also face competition in the emerging and rapidly evolving markets for intraoral scanners and cadcam software although the number of competitors varies by segment product geography and customer they include new and wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities due in part to the expiration of certain of our clear aligner key patents beginning in 2017 we are facing increased competition in the clear aligner market in addition corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has increased competition in the clear aligner markets outside the us these competitors include existing larger companies in certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us directtoconsumer “dtc” companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model requiring little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed doctors and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3d printing technology unlike our dtc competitors we are committed to doctors being at the core of our business strategy and invisalign treatment requires a doctors prescription and an inperson physical examination of the patient’s dentition before treatment can begin information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “ risk factors ” 

we believe we are well positioned to compete in the markets we target our significant historical and ongoing investments in research and design in around the movement of teeth smarttrack aligner materials and design intraoral scanning 3d manufacturing and an in depth understanding of the drivers and motivations within the orthodontic and gp dental markets are among a few of our key competitive factors that compare favorably with our competitors’ products and services 

government regulation 

many countries throughout the world have established regulatory frameworks for commercialization of medical devices as a designer manufacturer and marketer of medical devices we are obligated to comply with the respective framework of these countries to obtain and maintain access to these global markets the framework often defines requirements for marketing authorizations which vary by country failure to obtain appropriate marketing authorization and to meet all local requirements including specific quality and safety standards in any country in which we currently market our products could cause commercial disruption andor subject us to sanctions and fines delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such marketing authorizations or the loss of any previously received authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

with regards to premarket authorization in the us many of our products are classified as medical devices under the us food drug and cosmetic act “fdc act” the fdc act requires these products when sold in the us to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with medical device regulations defined by the fda the regulatory framework depends on a set of written processes for ensuring consistent quality called a quality management system qms coupled with a product marketing authorization which depends on the risk classification of the product this regulatory framework is comparable to the framework established in the european union “eu” within the eu our products are subject to the requirements defined by the medical device regulation eu 2017745 which replaced the medical device directive 9342eec with a final transition date of may 26 2021 similar market access regulations exist in brazil china japan and other countries our qms is routinely audited by certification bodies as well as country regulators for compliance with applicable regulations 

we believe we are in compliance with all state federal and international regulatory requirements applicable to our products 

we are also subject to various laws inside and outside the us concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sale and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products as a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by state or federal funded programs such as medicaid a foreign national healthcare program or private pay insurance each of which may offer some degree of oversight many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us and china to multinational requirements in the eu in the us final regulations implementing amendments to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the hipaa omnibus rule we are also required to be in compliance with the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” in the eu we must comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which serves as a harmonization of european dataprivacy laws with relocation of our emea headquarters to switzerland the swiss federal act on data protection “fadp” passed september 25 2020 becomes increasingly important expansion into latam markets requires us to comply with brazils lei geral de proteção de dados “lgpd” meanwhile the apac and emea regions have also seen rapid development of privacy laws including india russia china south korea singapore hong kong and australia

risks relating to our business operations and strategy 

our results of operations have been materially adversely affected by global and regional efforts to mitigate the spread of covid19 and we expect this will continue in as yet unknown ways and to varying degrees in the future 

the broad and extensive impact of the covid19 pandemic on virtually all aspects of our business and society generally has exacerbated many of the preexisting risks to our business by making some or many of them more likely to occur or more impactful when they do occur accordingly you should consider the risks in this risk factor in addition to and not in lieu of the risks identified throughout this section discussing the risks related to our business 

covid19 created significant widespread and unprecedented volatility uncertainty and economic instability disrupting broad aspects of the global economy our operations and the businesses of our customers and suppliers renewed outbreaks of covid19 may harm recovering consumer confidence or renew implementation of harsh preventative measures because covid19 spreads readily through airways in nasal passages and the mouth our principal customers dental and orthodontic practices were an initial focus leading to the complete or substantial closures of their operations materially harming our sales and sales efforts while practices across all regions have largely reopened many have not returned to prepandemic capacities 

in response to covid19 we implemented measures aimed at limiting its spread for the health and safety of our employees customers patients and the communities in which we live and work as well as in accordance with orders and decrees of governmental agencies these measures included diagnostic screenings at our facilities increased social distancing mandates closures of physical offices manufacturing and treatment planning facilities including our us corporate headquarters and regional facilities worldwide implementing remote working where feasible prohibiting nonessential travel and converting underutilized manufacturing capacity to produce personal protective equipment many of these actions remain in effect and we may implement new or revise existing requirements as circumstances require some of which may be highly disruptive to our business and may ultimately prove wholly or partially ineffective even if effective if employees perceive them to be inadequate or overly burdensome or they prove difficult to maintain over extended periods of time productivity may decline or we may experience employee unrest slowdowns stoppages or other demands we may fail to timely meet customer demand or fulfill orders the costs to maintain or implement protective measures or deliver our products may increase and we may be subject to increased litigation including product liability and occupational safety and condition claims 

as the economic and societal impact of the pandemic continues to unfold we are continually evaluating macroeconomic as well as industryspecific factors including the extent our business and financial results are or may be impacted as well as those of our customers and suppliers and the financial health and stability of businesses and consumers overall depends on numerous evolving factors many of which we cannot control nor accurately predict examples include 

• the duration scope and severity of governmental business and societal actions in response to the pandemic 

• the time in which dental practices return to prepandemic operating capacities and our ability to timely and effectively respond to decreases or increases in demand 

• the impact on worldwide economic activity employment rates and actions taken by central banks and governments 

• changes in product and services demand particularly for products or services that may be deemed discretionary or that can be delayed or cancelled 

• the liquidity and financial stability of consumers customers and patients including their willingness to purchase our products and services delays paying for products or services requests for extended payment terms or payment defaults 

• travel restrictions including those that adversely impair or prohibit patients from visiting their doctors and our sales personnel from interacting with customers 

• diversion of management as they focus on the short and longterm ramifications of the pandemic 

• actions by us or our competitors such as price reductions aggressive product promotions changes in or the launch or termination of products or product lines and mergers consolidations and liquidations 

• the confidence of our customers and patients that our products and solutions are sanitary and safe to use 

• customer and consumer purchasing behavior changes as pandemicrelated restrictions are curtailed or lifted remote working declines and travel and discretionary spending patterns shift 

• data privacy and cybersecurity risks from new or expanded use of remote working andor teledentistry by our suppliers customers and us including new or expanded use of online service platforms products and solutions such as video conferencing applications doctor consumer and patient apps inadequately secured computing networks or servers overheard telephone conversations viewable computer screens stolen passwords or access information increased phishing and other cyber threats and 

• the impact of remote working arrangements on our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting including our ability to ensure information required to be disclosed is timely and accurately recorded processed summarized reported and communicated to management including our chief executive and chief financial officers as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

the impact of the pandemic continues to evolve and we cannot predict the future impact on our business or results of operations although it may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and stock price as well as the businesses of our customers and economic activity generally 

our net revenues are dependent primarily on our invisalign system and itero scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products for any reason may adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

our net revenues are largely dependent on sales of our invisalign system of clear aligners an d itero intraoral scanners of the two we expect net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily our comprehensive products will continue to account for the majority of our net revenues making the continued and widespread acceptance of the invisalign system by orthodontists gps and consumers critical to our future success sales of our itero scanners are becoming a larger percentage of our overall revenues and we expect the acquisition of exocad to complement the adoption of digital dentistry if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign system treatment as rapidly or in the volumes we anticipate and at the prices offered if orthodontists or gps choose to continue 

using wires and brackets or competitive products rather than the invisalign system if sales of our itero scanners decline or fail to grow sufficiently or as expected if the acquisition of exocad does not produce the results expected or if the average selling price of our products declines for any reason our operating results could be harmed 

the average selling price of our products particularly our invisalign system are influenced by numerous factors including the type and timing of products sold price increases and reductions product mix product and services bundling promotions and foreign exchange rates we provide volumebased discount programs to our customers in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices which may differ based on country and season if we change volumebased discount programs that affect our average selling prices if we introduce price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we implement new or expand existing discount programs or participation in these programs increases if our critical accounting estimates materially differ from actual behavior or results or if our geographic channel or product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected moreover some programs may be unsuccessful or may drive demand in unexpected ways were any of the foregoing to occur our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may decline 

competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future and customers who create aligners or retainers in house 

the dental industry is in a period of immense and rapid digital transformation involving products technologies distribution channels and business models while our clear aligner and itero scanners facilitate this transition whether our technologies will achieve market acceptance and if adopted whether and when they may become obsolete as new offerings become available remains unclear 

currently our clear aligner system competes directly against traditional metal wires and brackets and increasingly against clear aligners manufactured and distributed by new market entrants and traditional manufacturers of wires and brackets both within and outside the us and from traditional medical device companies laboratories startups and in some cases doctors themselves due in part to market opportunities and the expiration of certain of our key patents beginning in 2017 competition in the clear aligner market is increasing the number and types of competitors are diverse and vary by segment geography and customers including new and wellestablished regional competitors as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities including the ability to leverage existing dental market channels to compete directly with us our competitors also include directtoconsumer “dtc” companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model requiring little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed doctors and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3d printing technology large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market 

the manipulation and movement of teeth and bone is a delicate process with potentially painful and debilitating results if not appropriately performed and monitored accordingly we are committed to delivering our invisalign system solutions primarily through trained and skilled doctors invisalign system treatment requires a doctors prescription and an in person physical examination of the patient’s dentition before beginning treatment however with the advent of dtc providers accompanied by significant advertising campaigns there has been a shift away from traditional practices that may impact our primary selling channels we also believe doctors are sampling alternative products andor taking advantage of competitive promotions and sale opportunities in addition we may face competition from companies that introduce new technologies and we may be unable to compete with these competitors or they may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any new technologies our business could be harmed to stimulate product and services demand we have a history of offering volume discounts price reductions and other promotions to targeted customers and consumers whether or not successful these promotional campaigns can have unexpected and unintended consequences including reduced gross margins profitability and average selling prices loss of market share and may discourage dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to use our products any of which could materially adversely affect our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues are derived from international sales and we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations and we expect to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in markets we believe have highgrowth potential moreover many of our key production steps are performed in locations outside of the us for instance technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans 

“clincheck” which are approved by licensed doctors before being transmitted electronically for to our aligner fabrication facilities these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture our aligners our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations including largescale operations in mexico costa rica and china and we continue to establish additional sites closer to our international customers also we maintain significant regional sales and marketing operations in switzerland singapore and china along with research and development operations globally including in the us russia israel and germany our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operations including 

• difficulties managing international operations including any travel restrictions on us or our customers 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

• import and export risks penalties controls license requirements and restrictions 

• controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process 

• difficulties hiring and retaining employees particularly employees with software and technological design and development backgrounds necessary to create develop and perform the more technical aspects of our operations as well as to service market and sell complex medical devices and technologies 

• the engagement in activities by our employees contractors partners and agents prohibited by international and local trade labor and other laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act of 2010 and export control laws in spite of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws 

• increased expense of developing testing making and marketing localized versions of our products 

• political military social economic or business instability acts of terrorism and acts of war including increased levels of violence and protests in various regions of the world including regions in which we operate such as the united states mexico hong kong the middle east and africa in addition some of our employees in israel are obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the israeli military and may be called for additional active duty under emergency circumstances which may materially impair all or a portion of our business operations critical to our itero operations were any of these events or conditions to occur the impact to us our employees and customers is uncertain particularly if emergency circumstances armed conflicts or an escalation in political instability or violence were to occur 

• general geopolitical instability and the responses to it such as the possibility threat of imposition of or changes in sanctions trade restrictions and tariffs particularly in key customer or manufacturing markets such as china mexico or other countries 

• interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services or critical systems or applications reliant on a stable and uninterrupted communications infrastructure 

• production or material transportation delays or disruption including as a result of customs clearance workforce unrest slowdowns or stoppages unionization efforts or as a result of disasters whether as a natural forces or human caused 

• burdens of complying with a wide variety of regional and local laws including antitrust and competition laws 

• the impact of governmentled initiatives to encourage the purchase or support of domestic vendors which can affect the willingness of customers to purchase products from or collaborate to promote interoperability of products with companies whose headquarters or primarily operations are not domestic 

• reduced intellectual property rights protections as compared to the protections afforded under the laws of the us 

• longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and 

• potential adverse tax consequences 

the potential impacts of the united kingdom’s “uk” withdrawal from the european union eu is still unfolding and could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses are subject including those involving data privacy and the regulation of medical devices the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services people data and information and significantly disrupt trade further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economies of the uk eu and the other economies in which we operate 

should any of these factors either individually or in combination occur they could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate or may decrease due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions and resistance to nontraditional treatment methods 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things pandemics prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates debt obligations discretionary income consumer confidence and consumer perception of current and future economic conditions a decrease in us or certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook both of which have or are occurring as a result of the covid19 pandemic would adversely affect consumer spending 

habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on elective nonurgent or higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally any of which would materially adversely affect our sales and operating results conversely the pandemic may have temporarily limited options for consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products may be harmed once travel and other restrictions are eased weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners and cadcam software in addition invisalign treatment which accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional metal brackets and wires orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may not find it costeffective or preferable to traditional treatment for instance a number of dental professionals continue to believe the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of patients increased market acceptance of our products depends in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products and treatment methods 

our success depends on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products and services 

our success depends on our ability to profitably and quickly develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products and services along with improvements to existing products and services there is no assurance we can successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of our products and services the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by any products or offerings is a function of many variables including our ability to 

• correctly predict timely develop and cost effectively manufacture or bring to market solutions that meet future customer needs and preferences with the features and functionality they desire or expect 

• allocate our research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects 

• ensure compatibility of our technology services and systems with those of our customers 

• anticipate and rapidly respond to new competitive products product offerings and technological innovations 

• differentiate our products and product offerings from our competitors as well as other products in our own portfolio and successfully articulate the benefits of those differences to our customers 

• innovate and develop new technologies and applications and timely obtain approval or clearance by government agencies such as the fda and analogous agencies in other countries  

• qualify for thirdparty reimbursement for procedures using our products 

• successfully identify timely develop and market products and services to new and evolving target markets and 

• encourage customers to adopt new technologies 

if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs doing so and our profitability may suffer even if our new products are successfully introduced it may be difficult to gain market share and acceptance particularly if doctors require education to understand the benefits of the new products or measure their success only after extended periods of time required to treat patients for instance it can take up to 24 months or longer to treat patients using our invisalign system consequently doctors may be unwilling to adopt our new products until they successfully complete one or more cases or until more historical clinical results are available 

any failure to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of new products or enhancements to existing products could materially adversely affect our operating results and cause our net revenues to decline 

we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our recent acquisition of exocad in the timeframe expected or at all which may have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results 

we closed our acquisition of exocad on april 1 2020 there is no guarantee that the acquisition will achieve the desired benefits and synergies or that the exocad cadcam software will continue to succeed in the marketplace 

in addition we do not have a history of significant acquisitions and integrating exocad during the covid19 pandemic poses challenges which may make it difficult to achieve the expected financial technical or strategic benefits of the acquisition in the time frames anticipated if at all potential risks we may experience include 

• difficulties integrating the business of exocad in the timeframes expected or as anticipated and without adversely impacting our existing operations or the operations of exocad 

• slower adoption of or technological difficulties uniting our product and service offerings to produce solutions that efficiently and effectively integrate with the workflows between doctors laboratories and other market participants 

• diversion of management resources 

• the inability to retain or attract key personnel 

• the failure to accurately estimate the potential markets and market shares for the companies’ products the nature and extent of competitive responses to the acquisition and the ability to achieve or exceed projected market growth rates 

• difficulties costeffectively integrating and dealing with tax employment logistics and other related issues unique to international operations particularly when travel restrictions make collaboration efforts more difficult 

• the potential that our due diligence did not uncover risks and potential liabilities that we fail to adequately mitigate or control them or that new risks and potential liabilities associated with exocad arise 

• the failure to successfully manage relationships with align and exocad’s historic customers suppliers and strategic partners and develop new relationships 

• product development delays and errors 

• possible inconsistencies in standards internal controls procedures and policies which may make it more difficult to implement and harmonize companywide financial reporting forecasting and budgeting accounting billing information technology and other systems 

• all or material portions of the expected synergies and benefits of the acquisition may change or disappear or may take longer to realize 

• negative impact on our gaap results of operations financial condition and liquidity from acquisitionrelated costs charges amortization of intangible assets andor asset or goodwill impairment charges 

• outcomes or rulings in known or as yet to be discovered regulatory enforcement intellectual property and other litigation antibribery and corruption or other similar matters that are alone or in the aggregate materially adverse and 

• our ability to protect our intellectual property rights as well as protect our it networks from cybersecurity threats and ensure customer and sensitive personal and health data remain secure 

if we cannot successfully integrate exocad with our existing business our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects we continue to establish additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to provide doctors with better experiences improve their confidence in using the invisalign system and itero intraoral scanners to treat more patients and provide redundancy should other facilities be temporarily or permanently unavailable our ability to obtain regulatory clearance and certifications for move into plan construct and equip additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks related to establishing facilities such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns any of which may be out of our control and may negatively impact our gross margin in addition these facilities may be located in higher cost regions compared to mexico china and costa rica which may negatively impact our gross margin if the transition into additional facilities is significantly delayed if a facility is required to temporarily or permanently partially or fully shut down or demand for our products increases we may be unable to fulfill orders timely or at all which may negatively impact our financial results reputation and overall business 

in addition because adapting production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions takes time our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements for instance as a result of the covid19 pandemic sales in the final weeks of the first quarter of 2020 declined substantially and operations at our manufacturing facilities declined shortly thereafter thereafter as dental practices reopened we experienced a rapid increase in demand if product demand decreases or increases more than forecast we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges we may be required to purchase or lease additional or larger facilities and additional equipment or we may be unable to fulfill customer demand in the time frames and with the quantities they require any of which may take time to accomplish lower our gross margin inhibit sales or harm our reputation or if we are required to implement additional protective measures to safeguard our employees productivity could decline production of our clear aligners and intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors including our dependency on third party vendors for key components 

in addition to limited production yields any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results  

if we fail to sustain or increase revenue growth while controlling expenses our profitability may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we need to continue increasing our net revenues while controlling expenses because our business and the markets we target are evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth or declines and we have not in the past and may be unable in the future to sustain or regain our historical growth rates which may cause our profitability to decline 

our operating results have and will continue to fluctuate in the future which makes predicting the timing and amount of our revenues costs and expenditures difficult 

our quarterly and annual operating results have and will continue to fluctuate for a variety of reasons including as a result of changing doctor and consumer product demand some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

• limited visibility into and difficulty predicting from quarter to quarter the level of activity in our customers’ practices 

• changes in geographic channel or product mix 

• weakness in consumer spending and confidence or a slowdown in domestic or international economies 

• higher manufacturing delivery and inventory costs 

• competition in general and competitive developments in the market 

• changes in relationships with our dental support organizations and distributors including timing of orders 

• changes in the timing of revenue recognition and changes in our average selling prices including as a result of the timing of receipt of product orders and shipments product and services mix geographic mix product and services deferrals the introduction of new products and software releases product pricing bundling and promotions modifications to our terms and conditions such as payment terms or as a result of new accounting pronouncements or changes to critical accounting estimates including without limitation those estimates based on such matters as our predicted usage of additional aligners 

• the creditworthiness liquidity and solvency of our customers and their ability to timely make payments when due 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the us dollar 

• our inability to scale suspend or reduce production based on variations in product demand 

• seasonal fluctuations including those related to patient demographics such as teen buying habits in the us china and europe as well as the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments 

• success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter 

• timing and fluctuation of spending around marketing and brand awareness campaigns and industry trade shows 

• our reliance on our contract manufacturers for the production of subassemblies for our intraoral scanners 

• increased advertising or marketing efforts or aggressive price competition from competitors 

• changes to our effective tax rate 

• unanticipated delays and disruptions in the manufacturing process caused by insufficient capacity or availability of raw materials turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes power outages natural or other disasters pandemics or general economic conditions impacting the solvency of vendors in our supply chain 

• underutilization of manufacturing and treat facilities 

• major changes in available technology or the preferences of customers may cause our current product offerings to become less competitive or obsolete 

• costs and expenditures in connection with such things as the establishment of treatment planning and fabrication facilities the hiring and deployment of personnel and litigation 

• unanticipated delays in our receipt of patient records made through intraoral scanners for any reason 

• disruptions to our business due to political economic or other social instability or any governmental regulatory or similar actions including the impact of epidemics and pandemics such as covid19 any of which results in changes in consumer spending habits limiting or restricting patient visits to orthodontists or general practitioners as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism 

• inaccurate forecasting of net revenues production and other operating costs 

• investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements and 

• material impairments of goodwill longlived assets or notes receivable 

to respond to these and other factors we may make business decisions that adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy and payment terms promotions development efforts product releases business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations for future revenues as a result if our net revenues for a 

particular period fall below expectations we may be unable to reduce spending to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we do not believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results are meaningful 

a disruption in the operations of a primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to timely deliver our products to our customers if we cannot deliver our products on time and cost effectively customers may choose alternative products causing our net revenues and gross margins to decline possibly materially if fuel costs increase so do our freight costs in addition we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales international sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

if we fail to accurately predict our volume growth and hire too many or too few technicians the delivery time of our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer software this requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process often 120 days or longer as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may have an insufficient number of trained technicians to ensure products are manufactured and delivered within the time frame our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations conversely if we hire and train too many technicians in anticipation of volume growth that does not materialize materializes at a rate slower than anticipated or if volumes decline our costs and expenditures may outpace our revenue growth harming our gross margins operating expenses and financial results 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems it systems all it systems are vulnerable to damage attack or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on such systems to effectively manage this growth our it systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards increasingly sophisticated cyber threats and changing customer preferences expanded remote working and increased customer usage of online technology platforms by us our customers and suppliers as a means to mitigate the spread of covid19 have increased the demands on and risks to our it systems and personnel moreover we continue to transform certain business processes extend established processes to new subsidiaries andor implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning “erp” software system which entails certain risks including disruption of our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data 

system upgrades new releases and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade and issue new releases of our customer facing software applications such as my itero our clincheck software myaligntech and the invisalign doctor site as well as our internal software applications upon which customer facing manufacturing and treatment planning operations are dependent software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect error or security vulnerability in our software applications or it systems incompatibility with customers’ computer operating systems and hardware configurations with a new release or upgraded version or the failure of our primary it systems may cause adverse consequences including delay or loss of revenues delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation loss of market share or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

a significant portion of our clear aligner production is dependent on digital scans from our itero and third party intraoral scanners a failure of all or any portion of ours or third party software or other components or systems to interoperate with itero or third party scanners termination of interoperability with third party scanners or a system outage for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accept scans manufacture clear aligners or otherwise service our customers which may amongst other things harm our sales damage our reputation or result in litigation 

if the information we rely on to run our businesses is inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our it systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could suffer operational disruptions have customer disputes and fail to produce timely and accurate reports we may also be required to respond to regulatory inquiries or actions forced to defend against litigation or pay damages penalties or fines experience increases in operating and administrative expenses find it necessary to rebuild networks or systems lose existing customers experience difficulties attracting new customers or implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third parties and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties expose personal and financial data of our customers and their patients create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects or present risks in design development manufacture or distribution including “bugs” security vulnerabilities and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system or compromise or exploit the safety and security of our networks the costs to eliminate or mitigate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and depending on the nature and extent of the problem and the networks or products impacted may result in network or systems interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing or developing new it systems integrating new it systems protecting confidential patient health information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional it systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our it systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised or we are unable to comply with data protection laws our operations may be severely adversely impacted patient care could suffer we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer financial as well as patient health information therefore it is critical that the facilities and infrastructure on which we depend to run our business remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures we have experienced breaches in the past and the infrastructure and systems on which we depend may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors or other technical malfunctions hacking or phishing attacks by third parties ransomware employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems for example some companies have experienced an increase in phishing and social engineering attacks from third parties in connection with the covid19 pandemic if we fail to meet our customer and patients’ expectations regarding the security of their information we could be liable for damages and our reputation and competitive position could be impaired affected parties could initiate legal or regulatory action against us which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in judicial or governmental orders forcing us to cease operations or modify our business practices in ways that could materially limit or restrict the products and services we provide concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others’ perception of us and deter customers advertisers and partners from using our products in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our it systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner we have cybersecurity and other forms of insurance coverage related to a breach event covering expenses for notification credit monitoring investigation crisis management public relations and legal advice the policy also provides coverage for regulatory action defense including fines and penalties potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion however damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any coverage 

we are also subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations including ones relating to privacy data protection content regulation and consumer protection we may be or become subject to data localization or data residency laws which generally require that certain types of data collected within a country be stored and processed only within that country or approved countries some countries including brazil russia and china have enacted and others are considering enacting data localization or data residency laws and we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols build new storage facilities andor devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws any of which could have significant cost implications we may also be subject to data export restrictions or international transfer laws which prohibit or impose conditions upon the transfer of such data from one country to another these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted applied created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us and china to multinational requirements in the eu for instance china has enacted new complex and highly restrictive cybersecurity data localization and cross border data transfer laws in the eu we must comply with the general data protection regulation which serves as a harmonization of eu dataprivacy laws maintaining compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 

in order to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products we may increase the amount we spend on marketing activities which may not ultimately prove successful or an effective use of our resources 

our marketing efforts and costs are significant and include national and regional campaigns involving television print media social media and more recently alliances with professional sports teams and other strategic partners we attempt to structure our advertising campaigns to increase brand awareness and adoption however there is no assurance our campaigns will achieve the returns on advertising spend desired or successfully increase brand or product awareness sufficiently to sustain or increase our growth goals which could have an adverse effect on our gross margin and business overall in addition various countries restrict direct to consumer advertising of our products and we could run afoul of restrictions and be ordered to stop certain marketing activities 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we fail to successfully obtain or enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type are costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property ip rights and to obtain and maintain further ip protection for our products our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 

we rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our ip and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and ip laws moreover our foreign patent portfolio is less extensive than our us portfolio we also rely on protection of our copyrights trademarks trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our ip we are currently involved in litigation and expect to be in the future the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation interferences oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews or other proceedings have been necessary and likely will be needed in the future to determine the validity and scope of certain of our ip rights and the ip rights claimed by third parties to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products any of these proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted expensive and distracting to management the outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

obtaining approvals and complying with governmental regulations particularly healthcare and data privacy compliance is expensive and timeconsuming and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals or comply with regulations regarding our products or services or the products and services of our suppliers or customers could materially harm our sales result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation 

as a medical device company align and many of our suppliers and customers are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous federal state local and foreign laws our healthcare provider customers and distributors are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences for instance regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates such as the us health insurance portability and accountability act “hipaa” may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants our critical vendors and service providers are similarly subject to various regulations our failure or the failure of our suppliers or customers to strictly adhere to clearances or approvals in the labeling marketing and sales of our products and services could subject us to claims or litigation including actions alleging false or misleading advertising unfair or anticompetitive business practices or other violations of laws or regulations which may result in costly investigations fines penalties as well as material judgments settlements or decrees there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks associated with the implementation and compliance with such laws or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

furthermore in general before we can sell a new medical device or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain clearance or approval unless an exemption applies for instance in the us fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

• product design development manufacturing and testing 

• product labeling 

• product storage 

• premarket clearance or approval 

• complaint handling and corrective actions 

• advertising and promotion and 

• product sales and distribution 

it takes significant time effort and expense to obtain and maintain fda clearances or approvals of products and services in other countries the requirements to obtain and maintain similar approvals may differ materially from those of the fda moreover there is no guarantee we will successfully obtain or maintain approvals in all or any of the countries in which we do business now or in the future even if successful the time and effort required may be significant and costly the impact of covid19 on normal governmental operations may delay our efforts to obtain and maintain approvals possibly significantly if approvals to market our products or services are delayed whether in the us or other countries we may be unable to market our products or services in markets we deem important to our business were any of these risks to occur our domestic or international operations may be materially harmed and our business as a whole adversely impacted 

in addition our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions in the us and other countries for example enforcement actions by the fda may include one or more of the following sanctions 

• warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties 

• repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products 

• operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production 

• refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products 

• withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals previously granted and 

• criminal prosecution 

we and certain of our vendors must also comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to satisfactorily correct an adverse inspection finding or to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement actions and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any enforcement action by the fda or foreign governments could have a material adverse effect on us 

in addition numerous foreign state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business and the businesses of our customers suppliers and service providers covering areas such as 

• the storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records 

• prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and 

• the marketing and advertising of our products 

the sourcing and availability of metals that may be used in the manufacture of or contained in our products may be affected by laws and regulations in the us or internationally regarding the use of minerals obtained from certain regions of the world like the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries these laws and regulations may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may furthermore suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free regardless compliance with these laws and regulations will require time and effort by our personnel and others and we will incur additional costs 

if we or any vendors on whose products or services we rely for our products and service infringe the patents or ip rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other ip rights is common in the medical device software 3d printing and other technologies and industries on which our products and services and based we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future we periodically receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of ip suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities exclusion orders or injunctions that may prevent or limit our rights to sell or import our products in one or more countries an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain key machines and materials and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we purchase the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source moreover we rely on a thirdparty manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our itero element scanner if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties are unable to hire or maintain personnel cannot timely obtain supplies are unable to maintain manufacturing standards or controls fail to timely deliver materials parts or components or if our relationship or the terms by which we contract with any of them changes we may be unable to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies finding substitute manufacturers may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of one or more products including our intraoral scanners causing us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to train and maintain our key sales force personnel could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our americas and international markets we do not have any longterm employment contracts with our direct sales force and the loss of the services of key personnel or groups of employees may harm our business in order to provide more comprehensive sales and service coverage and pursue growth opportunities we continue to increase the size of our sales force domestically and internationally moreover as we focus on market penetration we have begun to segregate sales personnel to focus on specific markets such as orthodontists and gps it can take up to twelve months or more to train sales representatives to successfully market and sell our products and for them to establish strong customer relationships if we are unable to expand our sales force retain our key sales personnel or quickly replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications if we are unable to successfully instill technical expertise in new and existing sales representatives if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers or if our efforts at specializing our selling techniques prove unsuccessful or not costeffective our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed 

we use distributors for a portion of the importation marketing and sales efforts related to our products and services which exposes us to risks that may be harmful to our sales and operations 

in addition to our direct sales force we have and expect to continue to use distributors to import market sell service andor support our products our agreements with these distributors may be nonexclusive and terminable by either party with little notice if any of these relationships are terminated and alternative distributors are not quickly found and trained in the use marketing and sales of our products and services our revenues and ability to sell or service our products in markets key to our growth and expansion could be adversely affected these distributors may also choose to sell alternative or competing products or services in addition we may be held responsible for the actions of these distributors and their employees and agents for compliance with laws and regulations including competition bribery and corruption and medical device and services marketing and sales activities a distributor may also affect our ability to effectively market our products in certain foreign countries or regulatory jurisdictions if it holds the regulatory authorization in such countries or within such regions and causes by action or inaction the suspension of such marketing authorization or sanctions for noncompliance it may be difficult expensive and timeconsuming for us to reestablish market access or regulatory compliance in such cases 

our business exposes us to potential liability for the quality and safety of our products and services how we advertise and market those products and services and how and to whom we sell them and we may incur substantial expenses or be liable for substantial damages or penalties if we are subject to claims or litigation 

our products and services involve an inherent risk of claims concerning their design manufacture safety and performance how they are marketed and advertised in a complex framework of highly regulated domestic and international laws and regulations and how we package bundle or and sell them to customers who may be private individuals or companies or public entities such as hospitals and clinics moreover consumer products and services are routinely subject to claims of false deceptive or misleading advertising consumer fraud and unfair business practices additionally we may be held liable if any product we develop or manufacture or services we offer or perform causes injury or is otherwise found unhealthy or unsuitable even if our products are safe if they are promoted for use or used in unintended or unexpected ways or for which we have not obtained clearance or approvals “offlabel” usage we may be investigated fined or have our products or services enjoined or clearances rescinded by administrative agencies or we may be required to defend ourselves in litigation although we intend to continue to maintain insurance for product liability business practices and other types of activities we make or offer coverage may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not be sufficient against potential liabilities any claim for product liability sales advertising and business practices regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs and damage our reputation increase our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results 

we have and expect to continue to make investments in promising research and technology primarily through privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments of the companies in which we invest they may generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop if at all furthermore valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due 

to the lack of readily available market data if we determine that our investments have declined in value we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

general risk factors 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development manufacturing sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success also depends on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists and production technicians in our treatment planning facilities few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

business disruptions could seriously harm our financial condition 

our global operations may be disrupted by natural or human induced disasters including earthquakes tsunamis floods drought hurricanes typhoons wildfires extreme weather conditions power shortages telecommunications failures materials scarcity and price volatility and medical epidemics or health pandemics for instance the covid19 pandemic and subsequent recovery materially adversely impacted our sales and business operations in 2020 the operations of our customers and the global economy overall climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and consequently risks to our operations and growth the occurrence of business disruptions could harm our growth and expansion result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our digital dental modeling is primarily processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations teams in costa rica and other global locations create clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition certain of our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in mexico and china both locations in costa rica and mexico as well as others are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing significant delays receiving their aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time moreover a significant portion of our research and development activities are located in california which suffers from earthquakes periodic droughts and wildfires affecting the health and safety of our employees any such business interruptions could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies or in the way these policies are interpreted by us or regulators can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 

we are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any adverse results from such assessment may result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we routinely assess update and refine our internal control over financial reporting for its effectiveness pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management our internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including changes in personnel updates and upgrades to existing software including our erp software system changes in accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial 

reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and increases our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective the timely filing of our financial reports could be delayed or we could be required to restate past reports and cause us to lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in the future which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the us dollar is our reporting currency a growing portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using constantly fluctuating often substantially exchange rates as a result negative movements in exchange rates against the us dollar have and may increasingly adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements we enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to currency fluctuations but there is no assurance these transactions will fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we are required to write down the value of the investment which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in an unstable credit or economic environment it is necessary to assess the value of our investments more frequently and we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under gaap we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired and assessing these assumptions and predicting and forecasting future events can be difficult large acquisitions such as our acquisition of exocad in 2020 require ongoing fair value assessments of goodwill and purchased assets to determine if they have become impaired consequently we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or longlived asset group is determined 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in global economic environment changes in legal entity structure or activities performed within our entities changes in tax laws regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changes in overall levels of pretax earnings the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and nondeductible goodwill impairments for example our effective tax rate varied significantly in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the relocation of our emea regional headquarters from the netherlands to switzerland our effective tax rate is also dependent in part on forecasts of full year results which can vary materially furthermore we may continue to experience significant variation in our effective tax rate related to excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation particularly in the first quarter of each year when the majority of our equity awards vest 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income 

as a us multinational corporation we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the us changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws could affect our income tax provision and net income 

or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business in addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws for example the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” has been working on a “base erosion and profit shifting project” which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions the oecd has issued and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business 

we may acquire other businesses products or technologies in the future which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our results of operations 

periodically we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies products or technologies like our acquisition of exocad in 2020 alternatively we may be unable to find suitable acquisition targets in the future and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do complete acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals or desired synergies and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers securities analysts and investors additionally as an organization we do not have a history of significant acquisitions or integrating their operations and cultures with our own if we fail to successfully integrate any acquisitions or the technologies acquired our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected or we may inherit or fail to uncover material issues of the acquired company or assets including litigation or ongoing investigations accounting irregularities or improprieties failure to comply with regulations governmental orders or decrees and it security and privacy compliance issues any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or we may fail to retain key personnel or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquired business we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any acquisition any of which could adversely affect our liquidity financial condition or the value of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any acquisition could result in dilution to our shareholders the occurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations 

moreover opposition to one of more acquisitions could lead to negative ratings by analysts or investors give rise objections by one or more stockholders or result in shareholder activism any of which could harm our stock price acquisitions can also lead to large noncash charges that can have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of writeoffs for items such as future impairments of intangible assets and goodwill or the recording of stockbased compensation 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock is subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

• the impact on global and regional economies as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity or changes in our forecasts and guidance 

• changes in recommendations by the investment community or their estimates of our net revenues or operating results 

• speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations 

• announcements by us or our competitors or new market entrants including strategic actions management changes and material transactions or acquisitions 

• technical factors in the public trading market for our stock that may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro industry or companyspecific fundamentals including without limitation the sentiment of retail investors including as it may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites the amount and status of short interest in our securities access to margin debt trading in options and other derivatives on our common stock fractional share trading and other technical trading factors or strategies 

• announcements regarding stock repurchases sales of our common stock credit agreements and debt issuances 

• announcements of technological innovations or new products or product offerings by us our customers or competitors 

• key decisions in pending litigation 

• sales of stock by us our officers or directors and 

• general economic market conditions 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities and we have not been excepted from such litigation 

we cannot guarantee we will repurchase our common stock again in the future and any repurchases may not achieve our objectives 

although we have not repurchased any of our common stock recently we have a history of recurring stock repurchase programs intended to return capital to our investors any authorization or continuance of our share repurchase programs is contingent on a variety of factors including our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors continuing determination that share repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements there is no assurance that we will resume repurchases of our common stock or continue repurchasing our common stock if we do resume consistent with historical levels or at all or that our stock repurchase programs will have a beneficial impact on our stock price 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock by creating the perception of difficulties or problems with our business that may depress our stock price

overview 

our purpose is to transform smiles and change lives and we are accomplishing this goal by establishing clear aligners as the principal solution for the treatment of malocclusions and our invisalign clear aligners as the treatment solution of choice by orthodontists general dental practitioners and patients globally to date over 96 million people worldwide have been treated with our invisalign system 

to encourage consumers to treat malocclusions with clear aligners under the direction and supervision of licensed dental professionals we have developed a business strategy designed to bring to market solutions that we believe strengthen our digital dental platform for doctors labs and partners including establishing the itero intraoral scanner and related services as the preferred 3d digital scanning solution and integrating computeraided design and computeraided manufacturing “cadcam” solutions and workflows into the markets for clear aligner orthodontics and dental restorative treatments our business strategic priorities are currently based on four principal pillars of growth i international expansion ii gp adoption iii patient demand  conversion and iv orthodontic utilization for a further description of our strategic growth drivers please see the business  business strategy section of this annual report on form 10k 

we strive to deliver on each of our strategic growth drivers through a variety of interrelated enterprisewide efforts including 

• new technology products and feature enhancements we believe technological innovations allowing dental professionals to more quickly and accurately diagnose plan and treat a wide range of cases from simple to complex combined with new and improved products drives greater treatment predictability clinical applicability ease of use and confidence for the dental professionals we serve thereby supporting adoption of invisalign treatment in their practices furthermore we believe the digital revolution in dentistry is an important aspect of the experience for our customers and their patients encouraging the utilization of our invisalign solution and therefore comprising an important component of our digital approach 

▪ invisalign clear aligners our product portfolio includes invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement invisalign go invisalign first and invisalign moderate we also continue to increase the clinical efficacy and applicability of our products as exemplified most recently in the announcement of invisalign g8 with smartforce aligner activation and our clincheck pro 60 3d treatment planning software each of these advancements broadens and strengthens our reach into key markets and demographics central to our strategic plans 

▪ itero scanner we continue to expand our intraoral digital scanning solutions periodically launching or announcing new offerings including most recently the itero element ® plus series of scanner solutions and previously the itero element 2 itero element flex and the itero element 5d imaging system for which we announced in march 2020 that we had obtained us fda 501k clearance and which we continue to release in additional countries the clearance of the itero element 5d imaging system in the us markets and its release in other countries allows us to sell this first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3d intraoral color and nearinfrared “niri” images into a single integrated scan that enables comparison over time using the itero timelapse technology thereby improving doctor experiences and improving engagement opportunities and communications with their patients the itero element 5d aids in the detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions above the gingiva without using harmful radiation 

• exocad on april 1 2020 we completed the acquisition of privatelyheld exocad global holdings gmbh “exocad” a german dental cadcam software company that offers fully integrated workflows to dental labs and practices we believe the acquisition strengthens our digital platform by adding exocad’s expertise in restorative dentistry implantology guided surgery and smile design to extend our digital dental solutions and broadens the align digital platform towards fully interdisciplinary endtoend workflows dentistry in lab and at chairside exocad also broadens our reach in digital dentistry with over 200 partners and more than 40000 licenses installed worldwide 

to further the transformation of dental and orthodontic practices from outdated manual and analog practices to endtoend digital workflows in 2020 we introduced virtual solutions such as invisalign® virtual appointment and invisalign® virtual care solutions that facilitate the safe effective and successful continuity of treatment of patients by conveniently connecting doctors and their patients throughout their treatment plans 

• invisalign adoption our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the treatment of choice for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental professionals which we refer to as “utilization rates” 

• for the fourth quarter of 2020 total invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the americas increased to 840 up from 795 in the fourth quarter of 2019 and international scans increased to 737 up from 647 in the fourth quarter of 2019 for the fourth quarter of 2020 948 of invisalign cases submitted by north american orthodontists were submitted digitally our annual utilization rates for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

 invisalign utilization rates are calculated by dividing the number of cases shipped by the number of doctors to whom cases were shipped our international region includes europe middle east and africa  “ emea ”  and asia pacific  “ apac ”  latin america  “ latam ”  is excluded from the above chart based on its immateriality 

• total utilization rate in 2020 increased to 161 cases per doctor compared to 159 cases per doctor in 2019 and 157 cases per doctor in 2018 

• north america utilization rate among our north american orthodontist customers increased to 673 cases per doctor in 2020 compared to 650 cases per doctor in 2019 and 567 cases per doctor in 2018 and the utilization rate among our north american gp customers increased to 96 cases per doctor in 2020 compared to 95 cases per doctor in 2019 and 91 cases per doctor in 2018 

• international international doctor utilization rate was 145 cases per doctor in 2020 compared to 138 cases in 2019 and 139 cases per doctor in 2018 

we expect global utilization rates to steadily improve as doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign clear aligners increases with advancements in products and technology and as patient and doctor demands for treatments that emphasize convenience and safety through fewer in office visits and less invasive and quicker treatments rise in addition the teenage and younger market makes up 75 of the approximately 15 million total orthodontic case starts each year and as we continue to drive adoption by teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs we expect utilization rates to imp rove however our utilization rates will fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors which may include seasonal trends in our business covid19related preventative measures and adoption rates for new products and features 

• invisalign doctor training we believe our training and education efforts are an important aspect of each of our strategic growth drivers and accordingly we continue to expand our invisalign customer base through the training of new doctors during 2020 we trained 21100 new invisalign doctors of which 9075 were trained in the americas region and 12025 in the international region in 2019 we trained a total of 22275 new invisalign doctors of which 9765 were trained in the americas region and 12510 in the international region 

• international invisalign growth our future growth is dependent upon the continued penetration and expansion of invisalign product usage in international markets accordingly we continue to focus our efforts towards increasing invisalign clear aligner adoption by dental professionals internationally in 2020 the covid19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions in our business as we our customers and suppliers experienced varying degrees of business and facilities closures and restrictions at various times that differed by geography and conditions and significant uncertainties remain for a further discussion of covid19 and its impact on our business see the section entitled covid19 update below moreover even under ideal circumstances the difficulties and intricacies of international sales and operations can be difficult to manage and we expect to periodically experience fluctuations in growth rates in emerging markets for reasons ranging from regional and macroeconomic conditions geopolitical tensions and competition among others for a description of the risks related our international growth efforts please see the risk factors section of this annual report on form 10k for instance prior to the impact of covid19 we experienced slower growth rates than prior periods in china which we believe were primarily due to the uschina trade war and resulting economic uncertainty which caused headwind for consumer demand especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases we also believe there has been increased competitive activity in china from clear aligner suppliers notwithstanding these uncertainties we continue to see growth opportunities with international orthodontists and gp customers particularly with adopters of digital dentistry platforms and as we continue to segment our sales and marketing resources and programs specifically around each customer channel furthermore we continue to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales coverage and professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in select country markets for instance we increased our sales presence in apac in the first half of 2020 and will continue to strategically invest in regions as we deem appropriate for longterm success we also intend to continue expanding our manufacturing and treatment planning operations to meet local and regional demand overall we expect international revenues to grow at a faster rate than americas revenues for the foreseeable future due to our continued investment in international market expansion the size of the market opportunities and our relatively low market penetration of these regions 

• increasing competition our primary competition for the sale of our clear aligners remains traditional wires and brackets although the number of clear aligner competitors primarily targeting the young adult demographic continues to increase we also have competitors in the markets for other products and services including intraoral scanners and cadcam software we believe our continued investments in product improvements and operational efficiencies make our products more compelling for our customers and their patients and we intend to maintain these efforts additionally we believe that welldesigned targeted sales and marketing promotions help us build on our strong brand awareness and differentiate us from traditional and emerging competitors accordingly we continue to increase investments intended to grow consumer demand during 2020 our marketing and consumer engagement included 

social media campaigns targeting teens and mothers through social media influencers becoming the official clear aligner sponsor of the national football league and introducing invisalign stickables which patients can apply to their aligners as a fun and simple way to distinguish themselves and our products from the competition we expect to make further investments to create additional demand for invisalign system treatment driving more consumers to dental professionals for those treatments 

we also believe that investing in our sales teams is important to our success the addition of sales representatives in apac in 2020 follows increases in the us in 2019 we believe the realignment of our sales teams to focus on the channels they serve allows us to partner with doctors in more meaningful ways assessing their specific needs and helping to tailor their practices for success while encouraging increased adoption and engagement of a variety of our products and services 

covid19 update 

the covid19 pandemic disrupted our business and the businesses and lives of our customers their patients and our suppliers in unprecedented ways requiring us to reevaluate priorities adapt to new ways of doing business and developing new strategies and plans quickly and revising them frequently as conditions evolved by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 many dental practices had resumed operations although often at capacities less than prepandemic levels additionally in virtually all practices the effects of covid19 persist typically in the form of additional preventative safety measures such as added sterilization requirements increased costs for personal protective equipment and staggered patient visits intended to reduce the risks of cross contamination each of which contribute to fewer patient visits per day 

to help doctors through the pandemic and to stimulate demand for our products and services during the recovery we modified existing programs and implemented new promotions in 2020 some of which remain in effect for instance we did not implement annual price increases on our various clear aligner products in 2020 offered promotions to encourage doctors with patients in wires and brackets to switch to our invisalign clear aligners allowed doctors to maintain their promotional status levels notwithstanding declining sales increased advertising and launched new media campaigns implemented new promotions and modified others all in an effort to help our customers and accelerate our mutual return to normal operations as a result of these efforts during the year ended december 31 2020 we recorded net revenues of 25 billion an increase of 27 compared to the same period in 2019 during the year ended december 31 2020 clear aligner case volume was 16 million an increase of 70 compared to the same period in 2019 and systems and services net revenues decreased by 28 compared to the same period in 2019 

in the short term our business remains susceptible to the covid19 pandemic concerns about additional outbreaks of the virus the spread of new variants of the virus and the efficacy of vaccines against those variants and efforts to slow or prevent a recurrence of its spread are likely to continue causing disruption and uncertainties in the markets adversely impacting our customers and their patients for an indeterminate period of time this in turn could impact our operations as purchasing decisions are delayed or lost create logistics complexities related to uneven or rapid changes in demand and sales and marketing efforts are postponed or prove ineffective conversely we believe the pandemic emphasizes the benefits of digital dentistry and virtual appointments over traditional practice methods that require frequent in office patient visits to manually adjust wires and brackets we further believe that this will in turn motivate doctors to use more digital solutions including our itero scanner exocad cadcam software and the invisalign system 

as we assess the possible future short and longterm impacts to our revenues operations and financial condition from the covid19 pandemic we are continually evaluating macroeconomic as well as industryspecific factors for instance among the many factors we continue to monitor are governmental and societal reactions to the virus global and regional economic activity unemployment and its potential impact on discretionary spending and health insurance coverage patient reluctance or fear of exposure as a result of orthodontic or dental office visits travel restrictions on employees suppliers customers and their patients and other external factors beyond our control furthermore if the threat of further spread of covid19 occurs or the pace of recovery by dental practices is haphazard or inconsistent there may be a substantial impact on our employees or suppliers our operations including our ability to timely obtain the materials needed to manufacture our products and manufacture and deliver those products to customers any of which may harm our results of operations financial condition and overall financial performance 

moreover many of the measures we implemented to protect our employees from the spread of the virus remain in effect for instance many of our offices across the globe remain underutilized as employees continue to work from home we are also screening our employees providing them with personal protective equipment and altering work environments to facilitate social distancing which has in the past and may in the future harm productivity furthermore if our employees or their families are sickened by covid19 our ability to respond or mitigate the impact of covid19 may be adversely impacted 

ultimately we believe the markets we serve will continue to recover from the covid19 preventative measures at differing rates and times corresponding with regional outbreaks and recoveries should any one or more events or circumstances previously mentioned or others occur or materially adversely increase or other unknown circumstances arise they could materially impact our business and results of operations in 2021 and beyond 

further discussion of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

2021 expenses 

overall we expect expenses in 2021 to increase over 2020 levels however as a result of the financial impacts of covid19 we expect to continue controlling our discretionary spending such as travel and meeting related expenses and focus investments in the following key areas 

▪ manufacturing capacity and facilities to enhance our regional capabilities 

▪ sales and marketing including additional direct sales force personnel and consumer marketing and 

▪ product and technology innovation to enhance product efficiency and operational productivity 

we believe these investments position us to take advantage of a recovering market and thereafter once markets return to greater normalcy increasing our revenues and growing our market share over the long term but they could negatively impact our results of operations particularly in the near term 

relocating headquarters 

effective january 1 2021 we moved our corporate headquarters from san jose california to tempe arizona which offers a favorable corporate operating environment along with longterm operating efficiencies the san jose office will remain our hub for global innovation product and market organization and home to our new digital innovation center there were no layoffs associated with this move 

results of operations 

net revenues by reportable segment 

we group our operations into two reportable segments clear aligner segment and imaging systems and cadcam services “ systems and services ” segment 

• our clear aligner segment consists of comprehensive products noncomprehensive products and noncase revenues as defined below 

• comprehensive products include but are not limited to invisalign comprehensive and invisalign first 

• noncomprehensive products include but are not limited to invisalign moderate lite and express packages and invisalign go 

• noncase includes but is not limited to vivera retainers along with our training and ancillary products for treating malocclusion 

• our systems and services segment consists of our itero intraoral scanning systems which includes a single hardware platform and restorative or orthodontic software options orthocad services and ancillary products as well as exocad’s cadcam software solution that integrates workflows to dental labs and dental practices 

net revenues for our clear aligner and systems and services segments by region for the year ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 are as follows in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

clear aligner case volume by region 

case volume data which represents clear aligner case shipments by region for the year ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 is as follows in thousands 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

total net revenues increased by 651 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of higher clear aligner volumes in the international region partially offset by lower average selling prices “asp” in the americas region and lower systems and services net revenues in most regions 

clear aligner  americas 

americas net revenues decreased by 119 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to lower clear aligner asp that decreased net revenues by 346 million the lower asp was as a result of higher promotional discounts which reduced net revenues by 446 million and unfavorable foreign exchange rates reduced net revenues by 152 million however these were partially offset by july 2019 price increases which contributed 233 million to net revenues the reduction in net revenues due to lower asp was partially offset by higher clear aligner volume which increased net revenues by 161 million 

clear aligner  international 

international net revenues increased by 841 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to higher clear aligner volume which increased net revenues by 1172 million partially offset by lower asp which reduced net revenues by 331 million lower asp was the result of higher promotional discounts that reduced net revenues by 443 million higher net deferrals that reduced net revenues by 193 million and a product mix shift towards lower priced products these reductions were partially offset by july 2019 price increases across most products along with a benefit from going direct in several additional countries and therefore we now recognize direct sales at full asp rather than the discounted distributor asp which combined increased net revenues by 209 million and favorable foreign exchange rates increased net revenues by 145 million 

clear aligner  noncase 

noncase net revenues increased by 35 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to increased vivera volume across all regions 

systems and services 

systems and services net revenues decreased by 106 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to a lower number of scanners recognized which decreased net revenues by 317 million and a lower scanner asp which decreased net revenues by 212 million the asp decrease was mostly due to higher promotional discounts partially offset by product mix shift to higher priced scanners these decreases were partially offset by higher itero service revenues mostly due to a larger scanner install base and the addition of exocad’s cadcam revenues from our acquisition which combined increased net revenues by 423 million 

cost of net revenues and gross profit in millions 

  



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding

provision for benefit from income taxes in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

during 2020 we completed an intraentity transfer of certain intellectual property rights and fixed assets to our swiss subsidiary where our emea regional headquarters is located beginning january 1 2020 the transfer of intellectual property rights did not result in a taxable gain however it did result in a stepup of the swiss tax deductible basis in the transferred assets and accordingly created a temporary difference between the book basis and the tax basis of such intellectual property rights consequently this transaction resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset and related onetime tax benefit of approximately 14935 million during the year ended december 31 2020 which is the net impact of the deferred tax asset recognized as a result of the additional swiss tax deductible basis in the transferred assets and certain costs related to the transfer of fixed assets and inventory the amortization of this deferred tax asset depends on the profitability of our swiss headquarters and the recognition of this tax benefit is allowed for a maximum recovery period of 15 years 

the decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 is primarily attributable to the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the intraentity transfer of certain intellectual property rights during the year ended december 31 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had the following cash and cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities in thousands 



cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments which primarily include corporate bonds us government treasury bonds us government agency bonds commercial paper and certificates of deposit 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 approximately 4125 million and 2785 million respectively of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from our international operations going forward and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our us operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our revolving line of credit we believe that 

our current cash balances and the borrowing capacity under our credit facility if necessary will be sufficient to fund our business for at least the next 12 months 

our business was materially adversely affected in 2020 by the covid19 pandemic and the global and regional efforts by governments to mitigate its spread while these impacts lessened in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 we could experience further adverse impacts to our business in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic we could experience reduced cash flow from operations as a result of decreased revenues and slower collections on our accounts receivable additional information regarding the impact of covid19 on our liquidity and capital resources may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors”

contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 



our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 475 million of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2020 we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

as of december 31 2020 we had additional operating leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of 181 million these operating leases will commence during 2021 with noncancelable lease terms of one to seven years 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a4 as of december 31 2020 other than certain items disclosed in note 11 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

indemnification provisions 

in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify certain parties customers vendors lessors and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 

it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period as of december 31 2020 we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment business combinations and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 “ summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of aligners scanners and services from our clear aligner and systems and services segments we enter into sales contracts that may consist of multiple distinct performance obligations where certain 

performance obligations of the sales contract are not delivered in one reporting period we measure and allocate revenues according to asc 60610 “ revenues from contracts with customers ” 

we identify a performance obligation as distinct if both of the following criteria are met the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract determining the standalone selling price “ssp” allocation of consideration from the contract to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition is the result of significant qualitative and quantitative judgments while changes in the allocation of the ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenues recognized for a particular contract any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition which would have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations this is because the contract consideration is allocated to each performance obligation delivered or undelivered at the inception of the contract based on the ssp of each distinct performance obligation 

clear aligner 

we enter into contracts “treatment plans” that involve multiple future performance obligations invisalign comprehensive invisalign first invisalign moderate and lite and express packages include optional additional aligners at no charge for a certain period of time ranging from six months to five years after initial shipment and invisalign go includes optional additional aligners at no charge for a period of up to two years after initial shipment 

our treatment plans comprise the following performance obligations that also represent distinct deliverables initial aligners additional aligners case refinement and replacement aligners we take the practical expedient to consider shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the performance obligation we allocate revenues for each treatment plan based on each unit’s ssp management considers a variety of factors such as historical sales costs and gross margin which may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation in making these estimates we also consider usage rates which is the number of times a customer is expected to order additional aligners our process for estimating usage rates requires significant judgment and evaluation of inputs including historical usage data by region country and channel we recognize the revenues upon shipment as the customers obtain physical possession and we have enforceable rights to payment as we collect most consideration upfront we consider whether a significant financing component exists however as the delivery of the performance obligations are at the customer’s discretion we conclude that no significant financing component exists 

systems and services 

we sell intraoral scanners and cadcam services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and unlimited scanning services the customer may also select for additional fees extended warranty and unlimited scanning services for periods beyond the initial year when intraoral scanners are sold with an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenues based on the respective ssp of the scanner and the subscription service we estimate the ssp of each element taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies revenues are then recognized over time as the monthly services are rendered and upon shipment of the scanner as that is when we deem the customer to have obtained control cadcam services where sold separately include the initial software license and maintenance and support we allocate revenues based upon the respective ssps of the software license and the maintenance and support we estimate the ssp of each element using historical prices revenues related to the software license are recognized upfront and revenues related to the maintenance and support are recognized over time for both scanner and service sales most consideration is collected upfront and in cases where there are payment plans consideration is collected within one year and therefore there are no significant financing components 

volume discounts 

in certain situations we offer promotions in which the discount will increase depending upon the volume purchased over time we concluded that in these situations the promotions can represent either variable consideration or options depending upon the specifics of the promotion in the event the promotion contains an option the option is considered a material right and therefore included in the accounting for the initial arrangement we estimate the average anticipated discount over the lifetime of the promotion or contract and apply that discount to each unit as it is sold on a quarterly basis we review our estimates and if needed updates are made and changes are applied prospectively 

unfulfilled performance obligations for clear aligners and scanners 

our unfulfilled performance obligations including deferred revenues and backlog as of december 31 2020 and the estimated revenues expected to be recognized in the future related to these performance obligations are 8734 million this includes performance obligations from the clear aligner segment primarily the shipment of additional aligners which are fulfilled over six months to five years also included are the performance obligations from the systems and services segment primarily services and support which are fulfilled over one to five years and contracted deliveries of additional scanners the estimate includes both product and service unfulfilled performance obligations and the time range reflects our best estimate of when we will transfer control to the customer and may change based on customer usage patterns timing of shipments readiness of customers facilities for installation and manufacturing availability 

contract balances 

the timing of revenue recognition results in deferred revenues being recognized on our consolidated balance sheet for both aligners and scanners we usually collect the total consideration owed prior to all performance obligations being performed with payment terms generally varying from net 30 to net 180 days contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue balances which are generated based upon timing of invoices and recognition patterns not payments if the revenue recognition exceeds the billing the exceeded amount is considered unbilled receivable and a contract asset conversely if the billing occurs prior to the revenue recognition the amount is considered deferred revenue and a contract liability 

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the respective reporting units based on relative synergies generated 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 

we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in performing the qualitative assessment we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as our actual and planned financial performance we also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed if after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment no further testing is performed however if we conclude otherwise then we will perform the quantitative impairment test which compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value an impairment loss would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations refer to note 6 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on goodwill 

finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions these assets are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fifteen years reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

we evaluate longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our longlived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many assumptions the estimation of fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when 

making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions and the structure that would yield the highest economic value among other factors refer to note 6 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on intangible assets 

business combination 

we allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date when determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets the estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows including forecasted revenues the discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and the determination of the assets’ life cycle amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenues and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statement of operation in the period in which such determination is made 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realizable 

during fiscal 2020 we completed an intraentity transfer of certain intellectual property rights and fixed assets to our swiss subsidiary which resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets and related tax benefits refer to note 15 “income taxes” of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information the establishment of deferred tax assets from the intraentity transfer of intangible assets required us to make significant estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of intellectual property rights transferred which include but are not limited to our expectations of growth rates in revenue margins future cash flows and discount rates the accuracy of these estimates could be affected by unforeseen events or actual results and the sustainability of our future tax benefits is dependent upon the acceptance of these valuation estimates and assumptions by the taxing authorities 

the us tax cuts and jobs act includes provisions for certain foreignsourced earnings referred to as global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” which imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations we have made the election to record gilti tax using the period cost method 

accounting for legal proceedings and litigations 

we are involved in legal proceedings on an ongoing basis if we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated we accrue the estimated loss in our consolidated financial statements if only a range of 

estimated losses can be determined we accrue an amount within the range that in our judgment reflects the most likely outcome if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount we accrue the low end of the range 

estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation are inherently difficult to make particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete facts and information the final outcome of legal proceedings is dependent on many variables difficult to predict and therefore the ultimate cost to entirely resolve such matters may be materially different than the amount of current estimates consequently new information or changes in judgments and estimates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations in addition we are subject to the broad market risk that is created by the global market disruptions and uncertainties resulting from the covid19 pandemic further discussion of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” for further discussion of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2020 we had no investments in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure based on interest bearing liabilities we have as of december 31 2020 we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we generally sell our products in the local currency of the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are generally denominated in their local currencies regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 

we primarily enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the gains and losses on these forward contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being economically hedged these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally are one month in original maturity prior to the closing of the exocad acquisition on april 1 2020 we entered into a euro foreign currency forward contract with a notional contract amount of €3760 million during the year ended december 31 2020  we recognized a loss of 102 million within other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operation we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes as our international operations grow we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates it is difficult to predict the impact forward contracts could have on our results of operations 

although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use forward contracts to minimize the effect of these fluctuations the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting billions of people or approximately 60 to 75 of the global population annually approximately 12 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and may be augmented with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer appliance of the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started we estimate that approximately 75 or 84 million could be treated using our invisalign clear aligners in addition approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth this represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using invisalign clear aligners and connecting them with an invisalign doctor of their choice 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computersimulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and access to proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  the invisaligntrained dental professional prepares an online prescription form on our invisalign doctor site and submits the patients records which include a digital intraoral scan or a polyvinylsiloxane pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition intraoral digital scans may be submitted through either aligns itero scanner or certain thirdparty scanners capable of accurately interfacing with our systems and processes see third party scanners and digital scans for invisalign treatment submission more than 73 of invisalign case submissions are now submitted via digital scan increasing the accuracy of treatments reducing the time from prescription submission to patient receipt and decreasing the carbon footprint resulting from the shipment of the materials used to form the physical pvs impressions and shipping those pvs impressions to us 

preparation of computersimulated treatment plan  using the information and digital data provided we generate a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan using our proprietary software which is not for sale or license a patient’s clincheck treatment plan simulates expected tooth movement in stages and details the timing and placement of any features or attachments to be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movements 

review and approval of the treatment plan by an invisaligntrained doctor the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement from initial position to final position and compare multiple treatment plan options by reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control of the patients treatment 

manufacture of custom aligners upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology a form of 3d printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the patients clincheck treatment plan 

shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear in most countries all the aligners for a patients treatment plan are shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals throughout the treatment aligners are generally worn for a period of time typically one to two weeks corresponding to the stages of the patient’s approved clincheck treatment plan the patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement through each stage at various points in each patient’s treatment their doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and the approved clincheck treatment plan 

at the treating doctor’s discretion weekly aligner changes are recommended for all invisalign treatments except for invisalign lite and express packages and may provide up to 50 shorter treatment time compared with twoweek aligner wear 

feature enhancements 

we continue to introduce enhanced features across the invisalign system to improve treatment outcomes or address broader clinical indications for example in 2018 we extended the invisalign product family with invisalign first clear aligners designed with features specifically for younger patients with early mixed dentition with a mixture of primarybaby and permanent teeth invisalign first clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients malocclusions including shorter clinical crowns management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion 

  

in 2018 we also introduced enhancements designed to improve dental professional and patient experiences and clinical outcomes including wing overlap and engagement in deep bite cases with anterior intrusion new options for mandibular advancement and symmetrical advancement of the left and right side a new default protocol for incremental advancement and improvements to support leveling the curve of spee in deep bite cases 

clear aligner products 



most of our invisalign treatment plans described above provide dental professionals with the option to order additional aligners if the patients treatment is not tracking against the original treatment plan the number of additional aligner orders and timing are subject to certain requirements noted in our terms and conditions 

comprehensive products  invisalign treatment options 

invisalign comprehensive  the invisalign comprehensive package is used to treat adults and teens for a full spectrum of mild to severe malocclusion and contains a wide variety of invisalign features to address the doctors treatment goals it also addresses the orthodontic needs of teenage patients such as mandibular advancement compliance indicators and compensation for tooth eruption 

invisalign first phase 1 and invisalign first comprehensive phase 2 package  invisalign first phase 1 is designed specifically for younger patients generally between the ages of seven and ten years which is a mixture of primarybaby and permanent teeth invisalign first phase 1 treatment provides early interceptive orthodontic treatment traditionally done through arch expanders or partial metal braces before all permanent teeth have erupted invisalign first clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients malocclusions including shorter clinical crowns management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion our invisalign first comprehensive phase 2 package is a continuation of the first phase 1 and is generally consistent with our invisalign comprehensive package after a patient completes invisalign first phase i doctors have the option to purchase a discounted comprehensive phase 2 package for that same patient 

noncomprehensive products  invisalign treatment options 

invisalign noncomprehensive products we offer a variety of lower priced treatment packages for less complex orthodontic cases noncomprehensive relapse cases or straightening prior to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers these packages may be offered in select countries andor may differ from region to region 

invisalign go we also offer invisalign go a streamlined noncomprehensive package designed for gps to more easily identify and treat patients with mild malocclusion the invisalign go package includes case assessment support a simplified clincheck treatment plan and a progress assessment feature for case monitoring 

noncase products 

clear aligner noncase products include retention products invisalign training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 

retention  we offer up to four sets of custom clear aligners called vivera retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse if necessary vivera retainers are available to both invisalign and noninvisalign patients in select markets we also offer single arch retainers 

smarttrack aligner material 

smarttrack is a patented customengineered invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear but smarttrack maintains more constant force over the period of time the patient wears the aligners the flexible smarttrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment 

scanner segment 

intraoral scanning continues to be an evolving technology that we believe will have a substantial impact on the future of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of a patients teeth digital scan using a handheld intraoral scanner digital scanning is faster more efficient precise and comfortable for patients compared to the discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions the accuracy of digitally scanned models substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes meaning patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments increasing overall patient satisfaction digital models also reduce the carbon footprint associated with the shipping of the materials used to create pvs impressions the shipping of those impressions and their disposal moreover the digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis orthodontic retainers and appliances and invisalign digital impression submission 

itero scanner  the itero element scanner is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures the expanded portfolio includes the itero element 2 and the itero element flex scanners which are each available in select regions and countries these products build on the existing high precision fullcolor imaging and fast scan times of the itero element portfolio while streamlining orthodontic and restorative workflows we also continue to offer the existing itero element scanner in existing markets the itero scanner is interoperable with our invisalign treatment such that a full arch digital scan can be submitted as part of the invisalign case submission process 

in february 2019 we launched the itero element 5d imaging system which provides a new comprehensive approach to clinical applications workflows and user experience that expands the suite of existing highprecision fullcolor imagining and fast scan times of the itero element portfolio in addition to offering all of the features and functionality that doctors have come to expect and rely on with the itero element 2 scanner the itero element 5d scanner is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3d intraoral color and nearinfrared niri imaging and enables comparison over time using itero timelapse niri technology of the itero element 5d imaging system aids in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions above the gingiva without using harmful radiation the itero element 5d imaging system is available in the majority of emea and select apac countries however it is pending regulatory approval in the us and latam countries 

in june 2019 we announced the launch of itero element foundation intraoral scanner with restorative software the itero element foundation extends our portfolio of intraoral scanners with powerful 3d visualization to better meet the needs of doctors labs and patients the itero element foundation is available in north america and japan and will be available in other select apac and emea countries in 2020 

restorative software for itero our restorative software is designed for gps prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons which includes restorative workflows providing them with the ability to send digital impressions to the lab of choice and communicate seamlessly with external treatment planning custom implant abutment chairside milling and laboratory cadcam systems 

orthodontic software for itero software designed for orthodontists for digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis and for the fabrication of printed models and retainers 

cadcam services and ancillary products 

ancillary products  we sell disposable sleeves for the wand and other ancillary products for the itero scanner 

itero models and dies an accurate physical model and dies are manufactured based on the digital scan and sent to the laboratory of the dentist’s choice for completion of the needed restoration the laboratory also has the option to export the digital file for immediate production of coping and fullcontour restorations on their laboratory cadcam systems the laboratory conducts then completes the ceramic buildup or staining and glazing and delivers the end result  a precisely fitting restoration itero prosthetics have a nearzero remake rate 

third party scanners and digital scans for invisalign treatment submission  we accept case submissions for our clear aligner products in two ways 1 physical impressions of the patient’s teeth or 2 intraoral scan of the patient’s teeth with respect to intraoral scans we accept scans from itero scanners and certain thirdparty scanners that have interoperability relationship with our systems and processes 

itero applications and tools 

invisalign outcome simulator  the invisalign outcome simulator is an exclusive chairside and cloudbased application for the itero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of invisalign treatment this is achieved through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current dentition next to hisher simulated final position after invisalign treatment 

invisalign 3d assessment tool the invisalign progress assessment tool provides the ability to compare a patient’s new scan with a specific stage of their clincheck treatment plan this allows doctors to visually assess and communicate invisalign treatment progress with an easy to read colorcoded tooth movement report 

timelapse timelapse technology allows doctors or practitioners to compare a patient’s historic 3d scans to the presentday scan enabling clinicians to identify and measure orthodontic movement tooth wear and gingival recession this highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions 

our itero element itero element 2 itero element flex and itero element 5d scanners include the invisalign outcome simulator invisalign 3d assessment tool and timelapse as well as the orthodontic software andor restorative software the orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee additional applications such as the invisalign outcome simulator are not available for sale separately 

other proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck and clincheck pro software the invisalign doctor site and feature enhancements are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items to revenues 

business strategy 

our goal is to establish the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans our technology and innovations are designed to meet the demands of today’s patients with treatment options that are convenient comfortable affordable while helping to improve overall oral health we strive to help our doctors move their practices forward by connecting them with new patients providing digital solutions to help increase practice efficiency and helping them deliver the best possible treatment outcomes and experiences to millions of people around the world we achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers as follows 



some time in the near term we will leverage our existing infrastructure in adjacent country markets as we build local sales and support organizations to drive longterm market penetration in addition we are scaling and expanding our operations and facilities to better support our customers across the globe in 2019 we opened a new order acquisition and treatment facility in wroclaw poland and a new treatment planning facility in yokohama japan to support customers within these regions 

 

 

 

manufacturing and suppliers 

we have manufacturing facilities located in juarez mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribution repair of our itero scanners and perform our cadcam services in the fourth quarter of 2018 we also began fabricating our aligners in ziyang china our first aligner fabrication facility outside of juarez mexico in addition we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand perform final scanner assembly and repair our scanners at our facilities in or yehuda israel and ziyang china our invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for itero restorative cases are conducted at our facilities located in san jose costa rica chengdu china cologne germany madrid spain wroclaw poland and yokohama japan information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source the need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs for a discussion of the risks of our supply and manufacturing operations see item 1a risk factors  

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused on increasing adoption and utilization of the invisalign system by orthodontists and gps worldwide and integrating the itero scanner into the doctors practice the scanner is an important component to the customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of invisalign treatments in each region we have direct sales and support organizations which include quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration we also have distribution partners in certain markets in the emea region we segmented sales and marketing for certain country markets into two separate organizations to serve each customer segment orthodontists and gp dentists separately thereby increasing our focus and effectiveness on gp dentists we continue to expand in existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in select countries 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 96000 active invisalign trained doctors which we define as having submitted at least one case in the prior 12 month period 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms these activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate the broad treatment capabilities of the invisalign system various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property portfolio represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2019  we had 489 active us patents 462 active foreign patents and 559 pending global patent applications our active us patents expire between 2020 and 2039 when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us which could negatively impact our operating results however we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will remain valid and enforceable or sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information 

regarding risks associated with our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends within our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve sales of invisalign treatments are often weaker in europe during the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday and seasonally higher in china during the third quarter particularly related to increased teen cases similarly other international holidays like chinese new year can also negatively impact our sales in apac in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our scanner segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

all invisalign treatments are individually unique and prescribed by a doctor so no two cases are alike the period from which a treatment data package or a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our invisalign backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future clear aligner revenues our quarterly clear aligner revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter we define our itero scanner backlog as orders where credit and financing are generally approved and payment is reasonably assured but the scanner has not yet shipped our invisalign and itero scanner backlogs as of december 31 2019 were immaterial 

competition 

currently our products compete directly against traditional metal brackets and wires and increasingly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us although the number of competitors varies by segment geography and customer we encounter a wide variety of competitors including new and wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities due in part to the expiration of certain of our key patents beginning in 2017 we are facing increased competition in the clear aligner market in addition corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has increased competition in markets outside the us these competitors include existing larger companies in certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us directtoconsumer “dtc” companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model requiring little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed physicians and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3d printing technology unlike our dtc competitors we are committed to a doctor as the core of everything we do and invisalign treatment requires a doctors prescription and an inperson physical examination of the patient’s dentition before treatment can begin information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “ risk factors ” 

key competitive factors include 



 

we believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

many countries throughout the world have established regulatory framework for commercialization of medical devices as a designer manufacturer and marketer of medical devices we are obligated to comply with the respective framework of these countries to obtain and maintain access to these global markets the framework often defines requirements for premarket authorizations which vary from country to country failure to obtain appropriate premarket authorization and to meet all local requirements including specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market our products could cause commercial disruption andor subject us to sanctions and fines delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such premarket authorizations or the loss of any previously received premarket authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

with regards to premarket authorization in the us our products are classified as medical devices under the us food drug and cosmetic act fdc act the fdc act requires these products when sold in the us to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with medical device regulations defined by the fda this regulatory framework is comparable to the framework established in the european union eu within the eu our products are subject to the requirements defined by the medical device directive which is generally consistent with fda regulations 

we believe we are in compliance with all state federal and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products 

we are also subject to various laws inside and outside the us concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products as a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federal funded programs such as medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us to multinational requirements in the eu in the us final regulations implementing amendments to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the hipaa omnibus rule we are also required to be in compliance with the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which went into effect in january 2020 in the eu we must comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which serves as a harmonization of european dataprivacy laws further expansion into latam markets will require us to prepare for brazils lei geral de proteção de dados lgpd scheduled to take effect in august 2020 meanwhile the apac and emea regions have also seen rapid development of privacy laws including india russia china south korea singapore hong kong and australia 

we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements information regarding risks associated with data security and privacy may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “ risk factors ” 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 14530 employees including 9470 in manufacturing and operations 2880 in sales and marketing which includes customer care 800 in research and development and 1380 in general and administrative functions

the following discussion is divided into two sections the first entitled “risks relating to our business” discusses some of the risks that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition the second captioned risks related to our common stock discusses some of the risks relating to owning our common stock you should carefully review both sections as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information appearing in this annual report on form 10k for important information regarding these and other risks that may affect us the fact we have chosen to list one section before the other or that we have identified risks in either section earlier than others should not be interpreted to mean we deem any risks to be more or less important or more likely to occur than others or if any do occur that their impact may be any less significant than others these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forwardlooking statements contained in this report because they could cause our actual results and conditions to differ materially from those statements before you invest in align you should know that investing involves risks including those described below the risks below are not the only ones we face if any of the risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 

risks relating to our business 

our net revenues are dependent primarily on our invisalign system and itero scanners and any decline in sales or average selling price of these products for any reason would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

our net revenues are largely dependent on the sales of our invisalign system of clear aligners and itero intraoral scanners of the two we expect net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily our comprehensive products will continue to account for the vast majority of our net revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread acceptance of the invisalign system by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success our itero scanners are used by dental professionals for restorative and orthodontic procedures as well as invisalign system case submissions sales of our itero scanners are continuing to grow becoming a larger percentage of our overall revenues and as a means to further adoption of digital dentistry and the invisalign system if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign system treatment as rapidly or in the volumes we anticipate and at the prices offered if orthodontists or gps choose to use wires and brackets or competitive products rather than invisalign if sales of our itero scanners decline or fail to grow sufficiently or as expected or if the average selling price of our products decline for any reason particularly in the case of our invisalign system as a result of a shift in product mix towards lower priced products or as a result of promotions or competition our operating results would be harmed 

competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

the dental industry is in a period of immense and rapid transformation involving products technologies distribution channels and business models much of which is based on digital transformation involving information technology data artificial intelligence scanning 3d printing software and algorithms while our clear aligner and itero scanners facilitate this transition there remains significant uncertainty concerning the technologies that will achieve market acceptance and if adopted whether and when they may become obsolete as new offerings become available 

currently our clear aligner products compete directly against traditional metal brackets and wires and increasingly against clear aligner products manufactured and distributed by new market entrants as well as traditional manufacturers of wires and brackets both within and outside the us and from traditional medical device companies laboratories startups and in some cases from doctors themselves although the number and type of competitors varies by segment geography and customer we encounter a wide variety of competitors including new and wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities due in part to the expiration of certain of our key patents beginning in 2017 we have faced increased competition in the clear aligner market these competitors include existing larger companies in certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us directtoconsumer “dtc” companies that provide clear aligners using a remote teledentistry model that requires little or no inoffice care from trained and licensed physicians and doctors themselves who can manufacture custom aligners in their offices using modern 3d printing technology in addition corresponding foreign patents began expiring in 2018 which has resulted in increased competition in markets outside the us large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market 

the manipulation and movement of teeth and bone is a delicate process with potentially painful and debilitating results if not appropriately performed and monitored accordingly we remain committed to delivering our solutions primarily through trained and skilled doctors invisalign treatment requires a doctors prescription and an in person physical examination of the patient’s dentition before beginning treatment however with the advent of dtc providers accompanied by significant advertising 

campaigns there has been some shifting away from traditional practices that may impact our primary selling channels we also believe doctors are sampling alternative products andor taking advantage of wires and brackets bundles that essentially give clear aligners away for free or at reduced prices in addition we may also face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors or one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any new technologies our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins and profitability loss of market share and result in the reduction of dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to use our products any of which could materially adversely affect our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital clinical treatment plans “clincheck” which are then transmitted electronically to our aligner fabrication facilities these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds and aligners our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations and we are continuing to establish these functions closer to our international customers to improve doctor and patient experiences and our operational efficiency also in addition to research and development efforts conducted in the us russia and israel we have operations in israel and china where we assemble wands and our intraoral scanner is manufactured our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

 

the united kingdom’s “uk” withdrawal from the eu on january 31 2020 commonly known as “brexit” has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above the withdrawal of the uk from the eu could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu and significantly disrupt trade between the uk and the eu and other parties further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the uk eu and the 

other economies in which we operate as the withdrawal continues to unfold the actual implications of brexit in their entirety are unlikely to be known for years 

if any of the risks outlined above materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenues 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to penetrate international markets and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in markets we believe to have highgrowth potential our international operations are subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 

any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions and resistance to nontraditional treatment methods 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the us economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on elective nonurgent or higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners in addition invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment involving metal brackets and wires and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it costeffective or preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products and treatment methods 

our success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products or product offerings 

our success depends on our ability to profitably develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products and improvements to existing products there is no assurance we can successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of new or improved products and services the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by new or future products or offerings is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to 



 

if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenues even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it may be difficult to gain market share and acceptance particularly if doctors require education to understand the benefits of the new products or measure their success only after extended periods of time required to treat patients for instance it can take up to 24 months or longer to treat patients using our invisalign system similarly we recently introduced our mandibular advancement treatment and expect it will require significant time and effort on our part to educate doctors to the benefits of this treatment method consequently doctors may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues 

we provide volumebased discount programs to our customers in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices which also differ based on regions and or country if we change volumebased discount programs affecting our average selling prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs or participation in these programs increases if our critical accounting estimates materially differ from actual behavior or results or if our geographic channel or product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected moreover we may find that some programs are unsuccessful or even if successful may drive demand in unexpected ways were any of the foregoing to occur our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the us dollar is our reporting currency a growing portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using constantly fluctuating often substantially exchange rates during the respective period as a result negative movements in exchange rates against the us dollar have and may increasingly adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements we enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to currency fluctuations but there is no assurance these transactions will fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational inefficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects we continue to establish additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to provide doctors with a better experience improve their confidence in using invisalign to treat more patients more often and provide redundancy should other facilities be temporarily or permanently unavailable our ability to plan construct and equip additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a facility such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors any of which may be out of our control and may negatively impact our gross margin in addition these facilities may be located in higher cost regions compared to mexico and costa rica which may negatively impact our gross margin if the transition into additional facilities is significantly delayed or demand for our products exceeds our current expectations we may be unable to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results reputation and 

overall business in addition because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin production of our intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors including our dependency on third party vendors for key components in addition to limited production yields any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results  

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods our profitability may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we need to continue increasing our net revenues while controlling expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have not in the past and may be unable in the future to sustain our historical growth rates which may cause our profitability to decline 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future making it difficult to predict the timing and amount of revenues costs and expenditures 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons particularly as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

 

to respond to these and other factors we may make business decisions that adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy promotions development efforts product releases business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below expectations we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to timely deliver our products to our customers if we cannot deliver our products on time and cost effectively our customers may choose competitive offerings or create their own aligners causing our net revenues and gross margins to decline possibly materially in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase in addition we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales international sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand or hire technicians faster than our actual growth projections the delivery time of our products could be delayed or our costs may exceed our revenues each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 

treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer software this requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process often up to 120 days or longer as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may have an insufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the time frame our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations conversely if we hire and train technicians in anticipation of volume growth that does not materialize or materializes at a rate we do not anticipate our costs and expenditures may outpace our revenue growth harming our gross margins operating expenses and financial results 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on such systems to effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences we are continuing to transform certain business processes extend established processes to new subsidiaries andor implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning “erp” software system which entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data 

system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the clincheck software myaligntech and the invisalign doctor site software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error in our software applications or information systems or incompatibility with customers’ computer operating systems and hardware configurations with a new release or upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others delay or loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation loss of market share to competition or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if the information we rely on to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely 

manner we could suffer operational disruptions have customer disputes fail to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems experience increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third parties and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential patient health information over public networks because we store and transmit sensitive information including protected patient health information security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss we have experienced breaches in the past and our security measures may be inadequate to prevent future security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient health information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised or we are unable to comply with data protection laws patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer financial as well as patient health information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures we have experienced breaches in the past and our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors or other technical malfunctions hacking or phishing attacks by third parties employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our customer and patients’ expectations regarding the security of customer and patient information we could be liable for damages and our reputation and competitive position could be impaired affected parties could initiate legal or regulatory action against us which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders forcing us to modify our business practices concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others’ perception of us and deter customers advertisers and partners from using our products in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner we have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification credit monitoring investigation crisis management public relations and legal advice the policy also provides coverage for regulatory action defense including fines and penalties potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion however damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any coverage 

we are also subject to federal state and foreign laws and regulations including ones relating to privacy data protection content regulation and consumer protection we may be or become subject to data localization or data residency laws which generally require that certain types of data collected within a country be stored and processed only within that country or approved countries some countries including russia and china have enacted and others are considering enacting data localization or data residency laws if countries in which we have customers adopt data localization or data residency laws we could be required to implement new or expand existing data storage protocols build new storage facilities andor devote additional resources to comply with the requirements of such laws any of which could have significant cost implications we may also be subject to data export restrictions or international transfer laws which prohibit or impose conditions upon the transfer of such data from one country to another these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted applied created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us to multinational requirements in the eu in the eu we must comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which serves as a harmonization of european dataprivacy laws we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 

in order to deepen our market penetration and raise awareness of our brand and products we have increased the amount we spend on marketing activities which may not ultimately prove successful or an effective use of our resources 

to increase awareness of our products and services domestically and internationally we have increased the amount we spend and anticipate spending in the future on marketing activities our marketing efforts and costs are significant and include national and regional campaigns involving television print media social media and more recently alliances with professional sports teams and other strategic partners we attempt to structure our advertising campaigns in ways we believe most likely to increase brand awareness and adoption however there is no assurance our campaigns will achieve the returns on advertising spend desired or successfully increase brand or product awareness sufficiently to sustain or increase our growth goals which could have an adverse effect on our gross margin and business overall 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property rights and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position for further details concerning our patents and other intellectual property please see “intellectual property” in part i item 1 business” of this annual report on form 10k 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws certain of our key patents began to expire in 2017 which have resulted in increased competition and less expensive competitive products we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we are currently have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation interferences oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews or other proceedings are have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights and in other instances to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products litigation interference oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted expensive and distracting to management the outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

obtaining approvals and complying with regulations enforced by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to obtain or maintain approvals for our products or services or failure to comply with regulations could materially harm our sales result in substantial penalties and cause harm to our reputation 

our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive and widely varying regulations in the us and internationally before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies internationally similar requirements apply on a country by country basis in the us fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 



 

it takes significant time effort and expense to obtain and maintain fda approvals of our products and services in other countries the requirements to obtain and maintain similar approvals may differ materially from those of the fda moreover there is no guarantee we will successfully obtain or maintain approvals in all or any of the countries in which we do business now or in the future even if we are successful the time and effort may take significantly longer and costs may be significantly greater if approvals to market our products or services are delayed whether in the us or other countries we may be unable to market our products or services in markets we deem important to our business were any of these risks to occur our domestic or international operations may be materially harmed and our business as a whole adversely impacted 

in addition our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions in the us and other countries for example enforcement actions by the fda may include any of the following sanctions 

 

we must also comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any enforcement action by the fda or foreign governments could have a material adverse effect on us 

the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our products may be affected by laws and regulations in the us or internationally regarding the use of minerals obtained from certain regions of the world like the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries these laws and regulations may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices we may furthermore suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these laws and regulations including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products 

we are required to annually assess our internal control over financial reporting and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we have implemented and routinely assess update and refine our internal control over financial reporting for its effectiveness pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management our internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including changes in personnel updates and upgrades to existing software including our erp software system changes in accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and increases our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective the timely filing of our financial reports could be delayed or we could be required to restate past reports and cause us to lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness 

of our financial reports in the future which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists and production technicians in our treatment planning facilities few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

  if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future we periodically receive and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain key machines and materials and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we may be unable to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 

we rely on a thirdparty manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our itero element scanner as a result if this manufacturer fails to deliver its components if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate or maintain acceptable terms we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed furthermore any difficulties encountered by this manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to timely deliver our products finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to train and maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our americas and international markets we do not have any longterm employment contracts with our direct sales force and the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business in order to provide more comprehensive sales and service coverage we continue to increase the size of our sales force to pursue growth opportunities within and outside of our existing geographic markets moreover as we focus on market penetration we have begun to segregate sales personnel to focus on specific markets such as orthodontists and gps to adequately train new representatives to successfully market and sell our products and for them to establish strong customer relationships can take up to twelve months or more as a result if we are unable to retain our direct sales personnel or quickly replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications if we are unable to successfully instill technical expertise in new and existing sales representatives if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers or if our efforts at specializing our selling techniques do not prove successful and costeffective our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed 

as compliance with healthcare regulations becomes more costly and difficult for us or our customers we may be unable to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act “hipaa” including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 

complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unhealthy or unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs and damage our reputation these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 

our global operations may be disrupted by natural or human induced disasters including earthquakes tsunamis floods drought hurricanes typhoons wildfires extreme weather conditions power shortages telecommunications failures materials scarcity and price volatility and medical epidemics or health pandemics climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of natural disasters and consequently risks to our operations and growth the occurrence of business disruptions could harm our growth and expansion result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue profitability and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our digital dental modeling is primarily processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico and we have and are building additional facilities in china both locations in costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing significant delays receiving their aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time additionally our sales and operations in china have been impacted and are likely to continue to be disrupted as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak moreover our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california which suffers from earthquakes periodic droughts and wildfires affecting the health and safety of our employees any such business interruptions could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies or in the way these policies are interpreted by us or regulators can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 

if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in an unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under gaap we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined 

we may experience unexpected issues and expenses associated with our corporate structure reorganization including the relocation of our emea regional headquarters to switzerland 

we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships in january 2020 in an effort to more closely align our international business activities and to achieve financial and operational efficiencies the implementation of this reorganization plan included the move of our emea regional headquarters from the netherlands to switzerland has been timeconsuming and costly may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the reorganization plan may not be more efficient or effective this relocation is accompanied by a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our results of operations and statement of cash flows including 

 

if any of these risks materialize in the future our operating results statement of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in legal entity structure andor activities performed within our entities changes in tax laws regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changes in overall levels of pretax earnings the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and nondeductible goodwill impairments for example our effective tax rate will vary significantly in our first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the relocation of our emea regional headquarters from the netherlands to switzerland effective january 1 2020 also we may continue to experience significant variation in our effective tax rate related to excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation particularly in the first quarter of each year when the majority of our equity awards vest 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income 

as a us multinational corporation we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the us changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws could affect our income tax provision and net income or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business in addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws for example the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” has been working on a “base erosion and profit shifting project” which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions the oecd has issued and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments impairments in the value of our investments and unsecured promissory note could negatively impact our financial results 

we have invested in privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments many of such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data if we determine that our investments have experienced a decline in value or are determined to be uncollectible we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

risks related to our common stock 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 



in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities and we have not been excepted from such litigation 

we cannot guarantee we will continue to repurchase our common stock and any repurchases may not achieve our objectives 

we have a history of recurring stock repurchase programs intended to return capital to our investors any authorization or continuance of our share repurchase programs is contingent on a variety of factors including our financial condition results of operations business requirements and our board of directors continuing determination that share repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders and in compliance with all applicable laws and agreements there is no assurance that we will continue to repurchase stock consistent with historical levels or at all or that our stock repurchase programs will have a beneficial impact on our stock price 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is presented under results of operations of this form 10k discussions regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to 2017 have been omitted from this annual report on form 10k but can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 filed with the sec on february 28 2019 which is available without charge on the secs website at wwwsecgov and on our investor relations website at investoraligntechcom 

overview 

our goals are to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion which to date over 8 million people worldwide have been treated with our invisalign system and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning device for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased clear aligner and other product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve these goals by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers set forth in the business strategy section of this annual report on form 10k 

the successful execution of our business strategy in 2020 and beyond may be affected by a number of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 



as we continue to expand our global presence we expect to seek regulatory approvals to offer our itero portfolio products in more countries thereby tapping potential growth opportunities in underserved markets 

 

 

we believe that over the longterm clinical solutions and treatment tools will increase adoption of invisalign and increase sales of our intraoral scanners however it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption which may vary by region and channel 

the use of itero and other digital scanners for invisalign case submission in place of pvs impressions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for invisalign utilization for the fourth quarter of 2019 total invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the americas increased to 795 up slightly from 788 in the third quarter of 2019 international scans increased to 647 up from 626 in the third quarter of 2019 we believe that over the longterm technology innovation and added features and functionality of our itero scanners will increase adoption of invisalign and increase sales of our intraoral scanners however it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption which may vary by region and channel 

 

 invisalign utilization rates are calculated by the  of cases shipped divided by the  of doctors to whom cases were shipped our international region includes emea and apac latam is excluded from the above chart as it is immaterial 



our doctors’ clinical confidence such that they now utilize invisalign more often and on more complex cases including their teenage patients 

 we expect our utilization rates to gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology which continue to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign clear aligners in addition since the teenage and younger market makes up 75 of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs we expect our utilization rates to improve our utilization rates however may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors including seasonal trends in our business along with adoption rates of new products and features 

 

 

 

 



was moved from amsterdam the netherlands to rotkreuz switzerland as a result we will continue to incur expenses in the near term and expect to realize the related benefits in subsequent years the implementation of this reorganization plan has been disruptive to our business and may not ultimately be more efficient or effective moreover our reorganization activities including any related expenses and the impact from affected employees could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and effective tax rates 

 

 

we believe that these investments will position us to increase our revenues and continue to grow our market share but will negatively impact results of operations particularly in the near term

clear aligner  international 

international net revenues increased by 1972 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by 2325 million this increase was partially offset by lower asp that reduced net revenues by 353 million the asp decline was mainly the result of higher promotional discounts which reduced net revenues by 450 million unfavorable foreign exchange rates lowered net revenues by 372 million and a product mix shift towards noncomprehensive products reduced net revenues by 190 million these asp decreases were partially offset by a 478 million improvement in net revenues related to price increases across most products along with a benefit from going direct in several additional countries and lower net revenue deferrals and sales credits that increased net revenues by 181 million

provision for income taxes in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

the increase in effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is primarily attributable to tax benefits recorded last year as a result of expiration of statute limitations that did not recur in 2019 and reduced excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation mainly due to nondeductible officers’ compensation for the year ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 we recognized tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of 16 million and 225 million respectively related to expiration of statute of limitations and 134 million and 265 million respectively related to stockbased compensation 

effective january 1 2020 as a result of the relocation of our emea regional headquarters from amsterdam the netherlands to rotkreuz switzerland our tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 and for the rest of the year will reflect a significant onetime tax benefit of up to 16 billion associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the intraentity transfer of certain intellectual property rights we continue to assess the realizability of this deferred tax asset as we take into account new information including the profitability of our swiss headquarters and ongoing communication with the swiss tax authorities

as of december 31 2019  approximately 2785 million of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries we repatriated 3500 million to the us during the year ended december 31 2019 under the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provisions of the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” and substantially all of the earnings previously determined to be not indefinitely reinvested have been repatriated our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from our international operations going forward and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our us operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our current revolving line of credit 

cash flows in thousands 



operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2019  cash flows from operations of 7473 million was primarily comprised of our net income of approximately 4428 million as well as the following 

significant noncash activities 

 

significant changes in working capital

significant noncash activities 

 

significant changes in working capital 

 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 3504 million for the year ended december 31 2019  which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of 6933 million  purchases of property plant and equipment of 1497 million and other investing activities of 147 million  these outflows were partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of 4854 million and payments of 218 million received on an unsecured promissory note issued by sdc in exchange for tendering our shares to them 

for 2020  we expect to invest 180 million to 200 million in capital expenditures related to building purchases and improvements as well as additional manufacturing capacity to support our international expansion although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide 

no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired refer to note 10 “commitments and contingencies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the purchases of buildings in petach tivka israel and san jose california 

net cash provided by investing activities was 69 million for the year ended december 31 2018  which primarily consisted of maturities and sales of our marketable securities of 3847 million and loan repayment from equity investee of 300 million  these inflows were partially offset by purchases property plant and equipment of 2233 million  purchases of marketable securities of 1802 million and purchases of investments in privately held companies of 50 million

common stock repurchases 

refer to note 12 common stock repurchase programs of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details 

 

we believe that our current cash cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows and need more funds beyond our available liquid investments and those available under our credit facility we may need to suspend our stock repurchase programs or seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

credit facility 

on february 27 2018 we entered into a new credit facility for a 2000 million revolving line of credit with a 500 million letter of credit sublimit and a maturity date of february 27 2021 as of december 31 2019  we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility refer to note 7 credit facility of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the credit facility  

contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 



1 sublease income is not material and excluded from the table above 

our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 427 million of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2019  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

as of december 31 2019  we had additional operating leases that have not yet commenced of 79 million these operating leases will commence between 2020 through 2021 with lease terms of 2 years to 4 years 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2019 other than certain items disclosed in note 10 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

indemnification provisions 

in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify certain parties customers vendors lessors and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 

it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period as of december 31 2019  we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of aligners scanners and services from our clear aligner and scanner segments we enter into sales contracts that may consist of multiple distinct performance obligations where certain performance obligations of the sales contract are not delivered in one reporting period we measure and allocate revenues according to asc 60610 “ revenues from contracts with customers ” 

we identify a performance obligation as distinct if both of the following criteria are met the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract determining the standalone selling price “ssp” allocation of consideration from the contract to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition is the result of significant qualitative and quantitative judgments while changes in the allocation of the ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenues recognized for a particular contract any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition which would have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations this is because the contract consideration is allocated to each performance obligation delivered or undelivered at the inception of the contract based on the ssp of each distinct performance obligation 

clear aligner 

we enter into contracts “treatment plans” that involve multiple future performance obligations invisalign comprehensive invisalign first invisalign moderate and lite and express packages include optional additional aligners at no charge for a certain period of time ranging from six months to five years after initial shipment and invisalign go includes optional additional aligners at no charge for a period of up to two years after initial shipment 

our treatment plans comprise the following performance obligations that also represent distinct deliverables initial aligners additional aligners case refinement and replacement aligners we take the practical expedient to consider shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the performance obligation we allocate revenues for each treatment plan based on each unit’s ssp management considers a variety of factors such as historical sales costs and gross margin which may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation in making these estimates we also consider usage rates which is the number of times a customer is expected to order additional aligners our process for estimating usage rates requires significant judgment and evaluation of inputs including historical usage data by region country and channel we recognize the revenues upon shipment as the customers obtain physical possession and we have enforceable rights to payment as we collect most consideration upfront we consider whether a significant financing component exists however as the delivery of the performance obligations are at the customer’s discretion we conclude that no significant financing component exists 

scanner 

we sell intraoral scanners and cadcam services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and unlimited scanning services the customer may also select for additional fees extended warranty and unlimited scanning services for periods beyond the initial year when intraoral scanners are sold with an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenues based on the respective ssps of the scanner and the subscription service we estimate the ssp of each element taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies revenues are then recognized over time as the monthly services are rendered and upon shipment of the scanner as that is when we deem the customer to have obtained control most consideration is collected upfront and in cases where there are payment plans consideration is collected by the one year mark and therefore there are no significant financing components 

volume discounts 

in certain situations we offer promotions in which the discount will increase depending upon the volume purchased over time we concluded that in these situations the promotions can represent either variable consideration or options depending upon the specifics of the promotion in the event the promotion contains an option the option is considered a material right and therefore included in the accounting for the initial arrangement we estimate the average anticipated discount over the lifetime of the promotion or contract and apply that discount to each unit as it is sold on a quarterly basis we review our estimates and if needed updates are made and changes are applied prospectively 

unfulfilled performance obligations for clear aligners and scanners 

our unfilled performance obligations including deferred revenues and backlog as of december 31 2019 and the estimated revenues expected to be recognized in the future related to these performance obligations are 6103 million this includes performance obligations from the clear aligner segment primarily the shipment of additional aligners which are fulfilled over six months to five years also included are the performance obligations from the itero scanner segment primarily services and support which are fulfilled over one to five years and contracted deliveries of additional scanners the estimate includes both product and service unfulfilled performance obligations and the time range reflects our best estimate of when we will transfer control to the customer and may change based on customer usage patterns timing of shipments readiness of customers facilities for installation and manufacturing availability 

contract balances 

the timing of revenue recognition results in deferred revenues being recognized on our consolidated balance sheet for both aligners and scanners we usually collect the total consideration owed prior to all performance obligations being performed with payment terms generally varying from net 30 to net 180 days contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue balances which are generated based upon timing of invoices and recognition patterns not payments if the revenue recognition exceeds the billing the exceeded amount is considered unbilled receivable and a contract asset conversely if the billing occurs prior to the revenue recognition the amount is considered deferred revenue and a contract liability 

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the respective reporting units based on relative synergies generated 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 

we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in performing the qualitative assessment we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as our actual and planned financial performance we also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed if after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment no further testing is performed however if we conclude otherwise the first step of the twostep impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value including goodwill refer to note 6 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on goodwill 

finitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of acquisitions and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

we evaluate longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our longlived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment the estimation of fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions and the structure that would yield the highest economic value among other factors refer to note 6 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the impairment analysis 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new 

information to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statement of operation in the period in which such determination is made 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realized 

the us tax cuts and jobs act includes provisions for certain foreignsourced earnings referred to as global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” which imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations we have made the election to record gilti tax using the period cost method

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 3182 million invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure based on interest bearing liabilities we have as of december 31 2019  we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we generally sell our products in the local currency of the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are generally denominated in their local currencies regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 

we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the gains and losses on these forward contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being economically hedged these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally are one month in original maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes as our international operations grow we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates it is difficult to predict the impact forward contracts could have on our results of operations the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2019 was not material 

although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use forward contracts to minimize the effect of these fluctuations the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting billions of people or approximately 60 to 75 of the population annually approximately 12 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and may be augmented with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer appliance of the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started approximately 75 or 84 million are applicable to invisalign treatment our served market in addition approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth but are unlikely to seek treatment through a doctor’s office this represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using invisalign clear aligners and connect them with an invisalign doctor of their choice 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computersimulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  the invisaligntrained dental professional prepares and sends us a patient’s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a digital scan or a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition intraoral digital scans may be submitted through either aligns itero scanner or a few qualified thirdparty scanners see third party scanners and digital scans for invisalign treatment submission more than 63 of invisalign case submissions are submitted via digital scan instead of a physical pvs impression 

preparation of computersimulated treatment plan  using propriety software which we do not sell we generate a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan the clincheck treatment plan simulates appropriate tooth movement in stages and details timing and placement of any features or attachments that will be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movements 

review and approval of the treatment plan by an invisaligntrained doctor  the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan 

manufacture of custom aligners upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology a form of 3d printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the clincheck treatment plan 

shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear  all the aligners for a patient are shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals throughout the treatment aligners are generally worn for a period of time which correspond to the stages of the approved clincheck treatment plan the patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and resulting clincheck treatment plan in october 2016 we introduced oneweek aligner wear at the treating doctor’s discretion weekly aligner changes are recommended for all invisalign treatments for invisalign comprehensive invisalign first comprehensive invisalign lite invisalign assist and invisalign go packages thereby reducing treatment time by up to 50 compared to two week aligner wear 

additional aligners  should the dental professional determine that the treatment is not tracking for various reasons such as patient compliance certain teeth movement not tracking to plan or they need to extend the treatment a few stages further to 

achieve their treatment goals the dental professional can request additional aligners at any point during the treatment subject to certain requirements in our terms and conditions

scanner segment 

intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of the patients teeth digital scan using a handheld intraoral scanner inside the mouth digital scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions the digitally scanned model is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction the digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis orthodontic retainers and appliances and invisalign digital impression submission 

itero scanner  the itero element scanner launched in september 2015 is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures the expanded portfolio launched in may 2018 includes the itero element 2 and the itero element flex scanners these additions build on the existing high precision fullcolor imaging and fast scan times of the itero element portfolio the nextgeneration itero element 2 is designed for greater performance with 2x faster startup and 25 faster scan processing time compared to the itero element the itero element flex is a wandonly device that transforms compatible laptop computers into a highly portable scanner that works anywhere  its ideal for practices with multiple locations who need a scanner that is convenient and easy to transport we market and sell the itero element in north america and in select international markets itero element 2 and itero element flex scanners are available in the us canada the majority of european countries including france germany italy spain and the united kingdom as well as select asia pacific markets the itero scanner is interoperable with our invisalign treatment such that a full arch digital scan can be submitted as part of the invisalign case submission process in addition the invisalign outcome simulator and invisalign assessment tool are exclusive to the itero scanner prior to the launch of itero element 2 and itero element flex we sold and continue to sell itero element and prior to that we sold the itero 29 scanner on february 18 2019 we launched the itero element 5d imaging system which provides a new comprehensive approach to clinical applications workflows and user experience that expands the suite of existing highprecision fullcolor imagining and fast scan times of the itero element portfolio in addition to offering all of the features and functionality that doctors have come to expect and rely on with the itero element 2 scanner the itero

third party scanners and digital scans for invisalign treatment submission  we support an open systems approach to digital scans and other intraoral scanning companies interested in qualifying their scanners to submit a digital impression in place of a traditional pvs impression as part of the invisalign case submission process we have qualified third party scanners for digital scan submission including 3m™ true definition scanner and the sirona cerec omnicam scanner information regarding legal proceedings associated with the scanner may be found in item 3  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  “legal proceedings” 

itero applications and tools 

invisalign outcome simulator  the invisalign outcome simulator is an exclusive chairside and cloudbased application for the itero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of invisalign treatment through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current dentition next to hisher simulated final position after invisalign treatment 

invisalign 3d assessment tool the invisalign progress assessment tool provides the ability to compare a patient’s new scan with a specific stage of their clincheck treatment plan to visually assess and communicate invisalign treatment progress with an easy to read colorcoded tooth movement report that allows the doctor to know how each tooth is tracking 

timelapse timelapse technology allows doctors or practitioners to compare a patient’s historic 3d scans to the presentday scan enabling clinicians to identify and measure orthodontic movement tooth wear and gingival recession this highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions 

our itero element itero element 2 and itero element flex scanners include the invisalign outcome simulator invisalign 3d assessment tool and timelapse as well as the orthodontic software andor restorative software the orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee additional applications such as the invisalign outcome simulator are not available for sale separately 

other proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck and clincheck pro software the invisalign doctor site   and feature enhancements are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items to revenue   

business strategy 

our goal is to establish the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans our technology and innovations are designed to meet the demands of today’s patients with treatment options that are convenient comfortable affordable while helping to improve overall oral health we strive to help our doctors move their practices forward by connecting them with new patients providing digital solutions to help increase practice efficiency and helping them deliver the best possible treatment outcomes and experiences to millions of people around the world 

we achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers 

 

 

 

 

manufacturing and suppliers 

our manufacturing facilities are located in juarez mexico and ziyang china where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribute and repair our scanners and perform our cadcam services and in or yehuda israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand and perform the final assembly of our itero scanner our invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for itero restorative cases are conducted at our facilities located in san jose costa rica chengdu china cologne germany and madrid spain information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw 

materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source the need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs see item 1a  risk factors — “we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and   operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases” 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused primarily on the invisalign system and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and gps worldwide in north america europe certain asia pacific country markets and more recently in brazil and certain countries in the middle east and africa we have direct sales and support organizations which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration we also have distribution partners that sell the invisalign system in smaller noncore international country markets we continued to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in select country markets 

  

for the itero scanner we have a small team of direct sales representatives and a few distributors in north america who leverage leads generated by our invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows we sell the itero scanner in select country markets internationally and will expand to additional markets over time to grow the scanner business 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 69940 active invisalign trained doctors which is defined as having submitted at least one case in the prior 12 month period 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms these activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2018  we had 449 active us patents 423 active foreign patents and 486 pending global patent applications 

our active us patents expire between 2019 and 2037 when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us which could negatively impact our operating results however we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends within our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve sales of invisalign treatments are often weaker in europe during the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday similarly other international holidays like chinese new year can also negatively impact our sales in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our scanner segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

all invisalign treatments are individually unique and prescribed by a doctor so no two cases are alike the period from which a treatment data package or a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our invisalign backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future invisalign revenues our quarterly invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter we define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where credit and financing is approved and payment is reasonably assured but the scanner has not yet shipped our intraoral scanner backlog as of december 31 2018  was not material to the business as a whole 

competition 

currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us although the number of competitors varies by segment geography and customer we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities due in part to the expiration of certain key patents owned by us beginning in 2017 we are facing increased competition in the clear aligner market markets as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us in addition corresponding foreign patents started to expire in 2018 and will likely result in increased competition in some of the markets outside the us furthermore we also face competition from companies that now offer clear aligners directly to the consumer and do not require the consumer to see a doctor before or during orthodontic treatment unlike these direct to consumer competitors we are committed to a doctor in the core of everything we do and invisalign treatment requires a doctors prescription and an in person physical examination of the patients dentition before treatment can begin information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “ risk factors ” 

key competitive factors include 



 

we believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

in order for us to market our products we must obtain regulatory authorization and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations both within and outside the us these regulations including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country failure to obtain regulatory approval and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market or plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines the approval by government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain and may not be granted on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our products are classified as medical devices under the us food drug and cosmetic act “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the us to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the fda our products may also be regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries in which they are produced or sold in the european union eu our products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission which was updated in april 2017 to the medical device regulation such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations 

we believe we are in compliance with all fda federal and state laws and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations 

we are also subject to various laws inside and outside the us concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products as a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federal funded programs such as medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us to multinational requirements in the eu in the us final regulations implementing amendments to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the hipaa omnibus rule align is also preparing for compliance with the recently passed california consumer privacy act “ccpa” scheduled to take effect in january 2020 in the eu align must comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which serves as a harmonization of european dataprivacy laws the gdpr went into effect may 25 2018 further expansion into latin american markets require align to prepare for brazils lei geral de proteção de dados lgpd scheduled to take effect in august 2020 meanwhile the asia pacific region has also seen rapid development of privacy laws including russia china south korea singapore hong kong and australia 

 we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 11660 employees including 7580 in manufacturing and operations 2320 in sales and marketing which includes customer care 700 in research and development and 1060 in general and administrative functions

 item 1a risk factors 

we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our net revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign treatment for any reason or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

we expect that net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily our comprehensive products will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines for any reason including as a result of a shift in product mix towards lower priced products our operating results would be harmed 

competition in the markets for our products is increasing and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us although the number of competitors varies by segment geography and customer we encounter a wide variety of competitors including wellestablished regional competitors in certain foreign markets as well as larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities due in part to the expiration of certain key patents owned by us beginning in 2017 we are facing increased competition in the clear aligner market as a result of the entry of new large companies into certain markets who have the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us in addition corresponding foreign patents started to expire in 2018 and will likely result in increased competition in some of the markets outside the us large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we also face competition from companies that now offer clear aligners directly to the consumer and do not require the consumer to see a doctor before or during orthodontic treatment unlike these direct to consumer competitors we are committed to a doctor in the core of everything we do and invisalign treatment requires a doctors prescription and an in person physical examination of the patients dentition before treatment can begin in addition we may also face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to our aligner fabrication facilities these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds and aligners our digital treatment planning and aligner fabrication are performed in multiple international locations we will continue to establish treatment planning and aligner fabrication facilities closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our north america facilities we also carry out research and development in moscow russia we also have operations in israel where we design and assemble wands 

and our intraoral scanner is manufactured our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

 

if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in the highgrowth markets our international operations are subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 



any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

we currently sell our products outside of north america as a result we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for us food and drug administration fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all which could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the us economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on elective or higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners in addition invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products or product offerings 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products or product offerings there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by new or future products or offerings is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to 



if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with invisalign since it typically takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline 

the frequency of use of the invisalign system by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of the invisalign system by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues 

we provide volumebased discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we change the volumebased discount programs affecting our average selling prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs in the future or participation in these programs increases or if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or to products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected and our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future as a result we enter into currency forward contract transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations these transactions may not operate to fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity and operational efficiencies at our manufacturing and treat facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects we are establishing additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency and provide doctors with a better experience to further improve their confidence in using invisalign to treat more patients more often our ability to plan construct and equip additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a facility such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors any of which may be out of our control and may negatively impact our gross margin in addition these new facilities are located in higher cost regions compared to mexico and costa rica which may negatively impact our gross margin if the transition into these additional facilities is significantly delayed or demand for our product exceeds our current expectations we may not be able to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business in addition because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand 

accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin production of our intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors including our dependency on third party vendors for key components in addition to limited production yields any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results  

we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to longterm and noncancelable leases we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease 

we have recently increased the number of retail locations leased by us as we continue to expand our invisalign experience program we do not own any of our retail locations we currently lease the majority of our invisalign locations under longterm noncancelable leases which usually have initial terms ranging from three to ten years we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be longterm and noncancelable generally our leases are “net” leases which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail location subject to a lease and decide to or are otherwise required to close it for any reason including as a result of an adverse ruling in the sdc dispute see “item 3 legal proceedings  sdc dispute” we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail spaces in desirable locations our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow our invisalign experience program as desired likewise our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our net revenues while controlling our expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have not in the past and may not in the future be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability invisalign volume and revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 



 

 

 

 

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our 

operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products to our customers if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and gross margin could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase in addition we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales international sales carry higher shipping costs which could negatively impact our gross margin and results of operations if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer technology requiring new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the time frame our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is primarily processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both locations in costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our corporate headquarters in california is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences we are continuing to transform certain business processes extend established processes to new subsidiaries andor implement additional functionality in our enterprise resource planning “erp” software system which entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data 

system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the clincheck and myaligntech software software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations 

of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third party and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties which we depend upon may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss we have experienced breaches in the past and our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures we have experienced breaches in the past and our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors or other technical malfunctions hacking or phishing attacks by third parties employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our customer and patient’s expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation and competitive position could be impaired affected parties could initiate legal or regulatory action against us which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders forcing us to modify our business practices concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others’ perception of us and deter customers advertisers and partners from using our products in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner we have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event covering expenses for notification credit monitoring investigation crisis management public relations and legal advice the policy also provides coverage for regulatory action defense including fines and penalties potential payment card industry fines and penalties and costs related to cyber extortion however damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available 

we are also subject to several federal state and foreign laws and regulations including ones relating to privacy data protection content regulation and consumer protection these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted applied created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us to multinational requirements in the eu in the eu align must comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective on may 25 2018 and serves as a harmonization of european dataprivacy laws we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2018  we had 449 active us patents 423 active foreign patents and 486   pending global patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws certain of our key patents began to expire in 2017 which may result in increased competition or less expensive alternatives to our products we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation interferences oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews or other proceedings are have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights and in other instances to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products litigation interference oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted expensive and distracting to management the outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including our transition of further business operations into our erp software system and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists and production technicians in our treat facilities few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

  

  if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 

we rely on a third party manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our itero element scanner as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate acceptable terms we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our americas and international markets we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business we recently hired approximately 100 sales personnel in the americas and plan on hiring 50 in the emea region in the first quarter of 2019 to adequately train and successfully deploy new representatives into these regions and to establish strong customer relationships takes approximately six to twelve months as a result if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise in recently hired sales representatives or if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed 

complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable 

to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

in addition as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to identify and discourage the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals additional reporting obligations are being proposed by the european union the us requirements and any additional requirements in europe could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our products for example these disclosure requirements may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our material sourcing is broad based and multitiered and we may be unable to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products we may suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these disclosure requirements including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act “hipaa” including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments impairments in the value of our investments and receivables could negatively impact our financial results 

  

we have invested in sdc and other privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments many of such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data if we determine that our investments and receivables in sdc or investments in other privately held companies have experienced a decline in value we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results in addition sdc is seeking through the arbitration described below under “item 3 legal proceedings  sdc dispute” the right to repurchase all of the company’s sdc membership interests for a purchase price equal to the current capital account balance as defined by the internal revenue service which likely is significantly below the current fair market value of such investment 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules relate to revenue recognition and leases 

if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the 

us financial sector in an unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under gaap we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws such as the tcja enacted into law on december 22 2017 regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements nondeductible goodwill impairments changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201609 in 2017 we anticipate our effective tax rate to vary significantly in our first quarter due to the timing of when the majority of our equity compensation vests each year other quarters can also be impacted depending on the timing of equity vests 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income 

as a us multinational corporation we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the us changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws could affect our income tax provision and net income or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business in addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws for example the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” has been working on a “base erosion and profit shifting project” which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions in 2015 the oecd issued and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business

 item 3 legal proceedings 

securities class action lawsuit 

  

on november 5 2018 a class action lawsuit against align and three of our executive officers was filed in the us district court for the northern district of california on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock between july 25 2018 and october 24 2018 the complaint generally alleges claims under the federal securities laws and seeks monetary damages in an unspecified amount and costs and expenses incurred in the litigation on december 12 2018 a similar lawsuit was filed in the same court on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of our common stock between april 25 2018 and october 24 2018 together with the first lawsuit the “securities actions” motions for appointment as lead plaintiff were filed on january 4 2019 align believes the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself align is currently unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss 

  

shareholder derivative lawsuit 

  

in january 2019 three derivative lawsuits were also filed in the us district court for the northern district of california purportedly on behalf of align naming as defendants the members of our board of directors along with certain of our executive officers the allegations in the complaints are similar to those presented in the securities action but the complaints assert various state law causes of action including for breaches of fiduciary duty insider trading and unjust enrichment among others the complaints seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of align which is named solely as a nominal defendant against whom no recovery is sought as well as disgorgement and the costs and expenses associated with the litigation including attorneys’ fees align is currently unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss 

patent infringement and related lawsuits 

on november 14 2017 align filed six patent infringement lawsuits asserting 26 patents against 3shape a danish corporation and a related us corporate entity asserting that 3shape’s trios intraoral scanning system and dental system software infringe align patents align filed two section 337 complaints with the us international trade commission “itc” alleging that 3shape violates us trade laws by selling for importation and importing its infringing trios intraoral scanning system and dental system software align’s itc complaints seek cease and desist orders and exclusion orders prohibiting the importation of 3shape’s trios scanning system and dental system software products into the us align also filed four separate complaints in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging patent infringement by 3shape’s trios intraoral scanning system and dental system software 

on may 9 2018 3shape filed a complaint in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging patent infringement by align’s itero element scanner of a single 3shape patent on june 14 2018 3shape filed another complaint in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging patent infringement by align’s itero element scanner of a single 3shape patent 

on august 28 2018 3shape filed a complaint against align in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging antitrust violations and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief relating to align’s market activities including align’s assertion of its patent portfolio in the clear aligner and intraoral scanning markets 

on december 10 2018 align filed three additional patent infringement lawsuits asserting 10 additional patents against 3shape align filed one section 337 complaint with the itc alleging that 3shape violates us trade laws through unfair competition by selling for importation and importing the infringing trios intraoral scanning system trios lab scanners and trios software trios module software dental system software and ortho system software on december 11 2018 align filed two separate complaints in the us district court for the district of delaware alleging patent infringement by 3shapes trios intraoral scanning system lab scanners and dental and ortho system software 

except for 3shape’s antitrust complaint each of the district court complaints seek monetary damages and injunctive relief against further infringement we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this dispute and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss if any nor estimate a range of possible loss 

sdc dispute 

in february 2018 we received a communication on behalf of sdc financial llc smiledirectclub llc and the members of sdc financial llc other than the company collectively the sdc entities alleging that the launch and operation of the 

invisalign locations pilot program constitutes a breach of noncompete provisions applicable to the members of sdc financial llc including align as a result of this alleged breach sdc financial llc notified us that its members other than align seek to exercise a right to repurchase all of aligns sdc financial llc membership interests for a purchase price equal to the current capital account balance the sdc entities’ communication also alleged that we breached confidentiality provisions applicable to the sdc financial llc members and demanded that we cease all activities related to the invisalign pilot project close existing invisalign locations and cease using sdc’s confidential information in april 2018 the sdc entities served a demand for arbitration alleging that we breached the noncompete clause and confidentiality clause misused the sdc entities’ alleged trade secrets and violated fiduciary duties to sdc financial llc the sdc entities seek through the arbitration the rights to repurchase all of align’s sdc financial llc membership interests for a purchase price equal to the current capital account balance as defined by the internal revenue service which likely is significantly below the current fair market value of such investment an injunction requiring us to close our invisalign locations and to cease using the sdc entities’ confidential information and financial damages in an unspecified amount we filed a response in which we denied the sdc entities’ allegations and denied that the sdc entities are entitled to any relief in april 2018 the sdc entities also filed a motion for preliminary injunction in the tennessee court of chancery seeking to enjoin align from opening additional invisalign locations until the arbitration is completed in june 2018 the tennessee court denied the sdc entities’ motion for a preliminary injunction in december 2018 the parties participated in binding arbitration proceedings and presented closing arguments on january 23 2019 the arbitrator’s decision is due on or before march 4 2019 this dispute does not impact align’s existing supply agreement with sdc which remains in place through 2019 we do not intend to renew this agreement we are currently unable to predict the outcome of this dispute and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss if any nor estimate a range of possible loss 

in addition in the course of align’s operations align is involved in a variety of claims suits investigations and proceedings including actions with respect to intellectual property claims patent infringement claims government investigations labor and employment claims breach of contract claims tax and other matters regardless of the outcome these proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors although the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and align’s view of these matters may change in the future as litigation and events related thereto unfold align currently does not believe that these matters individually or in the aggregate will materially affect align’s financial position results of operations or cash flows  refer to note 8 “legal proceedings” of the notes to the consolidated financial statement s for details on legal proceedings

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning device for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers set forth in the  business strategy  section in this annual report on form 10k 

the successful execution of our business strategy in 2019 and beyond may be affected by a number of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 



itero element portfolio while streamlining orthodontic and restorative workflows the nextgeneration itero element 2 is designed for greater performance with 2x faster startup and 25 faster scan processing time compared to the itero element the new itero element flex wandonly configuration is a portable scanner for easy transport from office to office itero element 2 and itero element flex scanners are available in the us canada the majority of european countries as well as in select apac markets the existing itero element scanner continues to be available in all markets 

 

we believe that over the longterm clinical solutions and treatment tools will increase adoption of invisalign and increase sales of our intraoral scanners however it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption which may vary by region and channel 

the use of itero and other digital scanners for invisalign case submission in place of pvs impressions continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for invisalign utilization for the fourth quarter of 2018 total invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the americas increased to 726 up from 710 in the third quarter of 2018 international scans increased to 575 up from 539 in the third quarter of 2018 in china invisalign cases submitted using a digital scanner increased to 459 from close to 0 in only one year we believe that over the longterm technology innovation and added features and functionality of our itero scanners will increase adoption of invisalign and increase sales of our intraoral scanners however it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption which may vary by region and channel 

 

 invisalign utilization rates   of cases shipped divided by  of doctors cases were shipped to beginning in the first quarter of 2018 we report international region to include emea and apac latam is excluded from above chart as it is not material our historical utilization numbers have been recast to reflect this new classification 



orthodontist utilization in 2018 reflects improvements in product and technology which continues to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence such that they now utilize invisalign more often and on more complex cases including their teenage patients 

 we expect that over the longterm our utilization rates will gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology which continue to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign in addition since the teenage and younger market makes up 75 of the approximately 12 million total orthodontic case starts each year and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage and younger patients through sales and marketing programs we expect our utilization rate to improve our utilization rates however may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors including seasonal trends in our business along with adoption rates of new products and features 

 

 

 we believe that these investments will position us to increase our revenues and continue to grow our market share but will negatively impact results of operations particularly in the near term 

 

 

results of operations 

we group our operations into two reportable segments clear aligner segment and scanner segment 

 effective in the first quarter of 2018 americas region includes north america and latam international region includes emea and apac historical data has been recasted to reflect the change 

  

net revenues for reportable segments by region

fiscal year 2018  compared to fiscal year 2017   

total net revenues increased by 4931 million  in 2018  as compared to 2017  primarily as a result of clear aligner case and scanner volume growth across all regions 

clear aligner  americas 

americas net revenues increased by 1492 million  in 2018  as compared to 2017  primarily due to case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by 1779 million this increase was offset in part by lower average selling prices asp which was mainly the result of higher promotional discounts which reduced net revenues by 447 million and increased net revenue deferrals by 30 million this decline was partially offset by higher prices from the new products introduced in july 2018 which increased net revenues by 192 million 

clear aligner  international 

international net revenues increased by 2107 million  in 2018  as compared to 2017  primarily driven by case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by 2130 million this increase was slightly offset by lower asp which reduced net revenues by 23 million the asp decline was mainly the result of increased net revenue deferrals mostly for additional aligners which reduced net revenues by 201 million and higher promotions discounts which reduced net revenues by 174 million these were partially offset by the favorable foreign exchange rates of 208 million and the higher prices of 183 million related to our new products effective july 2018 

clear aligner  noncase 

noncase net revenues consisting of vivera retainers training fees and other product revenues increased by 223 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  this was primarily due to increased vivera volume across all regions which increased revenue by 144 million and training revenues across all regions which increased revenue by 65 million 

scanner 

scanner and services net revenues increased by 1109 million  in 2018  as compared to 2017  this increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of scanners recognized which increased revenues 878 million additionally a larger scanner install base resulted in higher computeraided designcomputeraided manufacturing cadcam services which increased net revenues by 213 million and higher disposable sleeve volume which increased net revenue by 69 million these factors were offset in part by a decrease in scanner asp mostly due to increased promotional discounts which reduced net revenues by 55 million 

fiscal year 2017  compared to fiscal year 2016   

total net revenues increased by 3936 million  in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily as a result of clear aligner case volume growth across all regions and products as well as increased noncase revenue 

clear aligner  americas 

americas net revenues increased by 1825 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to case volume growth across all channels and most products which increased net revenues by 1955 million this increase was offset in part by lower asp which decreased net revenues by 131 million the asp decline was a result of a shift in product mix towards noncomprehensive products primarily driven by increased sdc revenues which carry a lower asp and higher invisalign promotional discounts which collectively reduced revenues by 584 million these factors contributing to the decline in asp were partially offset in part by price increases on our comprehensive products effective on april 1 2017 which contributed 284 million to net revenues as well as an increase in additional aligner revenue which contributed 108 million to net revenues among other factors 

clear aligner  international 

international net revenues increased by 1498 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily driven by case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by 1429 million and to a lesser extent higher asp which contributed approximately 68 million to the increase in net revenues the increase in asp was primarily due to price increases in our comprehensive products effective on july 1 2017 as well as the impact from acquiring certain distributors as we now recognize direct sales at full asp rather than the discounted asp which collectively contributed 244 million to net revenues the factors contributing to an increase in asp were partially offset in part by higher promotional discounts which decreased net revenues by 137 million as well as an increase in net revenue deferrals of 30 million among other factors 

clear aligner  noncase 

noncase net revenues consisting of vivera retainers training fees and ancillary product revenues increased by 187 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to increased vivera volume both in americas and international 

scanner 

scanner net revenues increased by  426 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily as a result of an increase in the number of scanners recognized which increased net revenues by 297 million as well as higher cadcam services resulting from a larger installed base of scanners which contributed 162 million to net revenues these increases were offset in part by a decrease in scanner asp which reduced net revenues by 33 million

provision for income taxes in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

our provision for income taxes was 577 million  1302 million  and 512 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively representing effective tax rates of 124  357  and 211  respectively 

the decrease in effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 is mainly driven by the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 related to the tcja that did not recur in 2018 the recognition of tax benefits related to a statute of limitations expiration and the increase in excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation offset in part by the unfavorable tax impact of the tcja including nondeductible officers compensation and reduced tax benefits from foreign earnings being taxed at a lower rate for the year ended december 31 2018 the excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation we recognized in our provision for income taxes was 265 million 

in june 2017 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted an extension of certain income tax incentives for an additional twelve year period under these incentives all of the income in costa rica is subject to a reduced tax rate in order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2018 2017 and 2016 as a result of these incentives our income taxes were reduced by 24 million 18 million and 191 million in the year ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 003 002 and 023 in the year ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively  refer to note 13 accounting for income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on income taxes

we believe that our current cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows and need more funds beyond our available liquid investments and those available under our credit facility we may need to suspend our stock repurchase programs or seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

credit facility 

on february 27 2018 we entered into a new credit facility for a 2000 million revolving line of credit with a 500 million letter of credit sublimit and a maturity date of february 27 2021 replacing the existing credit facility which provided for a 500 million revolving line of credit with a 100 million letter of credit as of december 31 2018 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility  refer to note 7 credit facility   of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the credit facility  

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 



1 sublease income is not material and excluded from the table above 

our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 282 million of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2018  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

we had no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2018  other than certain items disclosed in note 9 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

indemnification provisions 

in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify customers vendors lessors and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 

it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period as of december 31 2018  we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies   of the notes to consolidated financial statements  under item 8 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of aligners scanners and services from our clear aligner and scanner segments we enter into sales contracts that may consist of multiple distinct performance obligations where certain performance obligations of the sales contract are not delivered in one reporting period we measure and allocate revenues according to asc 60610 “ revenues from contracts with customers ” 

we identify a performance obligation as distinct if both of the following criteria are true the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract determining the standalone selling price “ssp” and allocation of consideration from a contract to the individual performance obligations and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition is the result of significant qualitative and quantitative judgments management considers a variety of factors such as historical sales usage rates the number of times a customer is expected to order additional aligners costs and expected margin which may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation in making these estimates further our process for estimating usage rates require significant judgment and evaluation of inputs including historical data and forecasted usages while changes in the allocation of the ssp between performance obligations will not affect the amount of total revenues recognized for a particular contract any material changes could impact the timing of revenue recognition which would have a material effect on our financial position and result of operations this is because the contract consideration is allocated to each performance obligation delivered or undelivered at the inception of the contract based on the ssp of each distinct performance obligation 

clear aligner 

we enter into contracts “treatment plans” that involve multiple future performance obligations invisalign comprehensive invisalign full invisalign teen invisalign first invisalign express 10 invisalign express 5 express package lite package and invisalign assist products include optional additional aligners at no charge for a certain period of time ranging from one to five years after initial shipment and invisalign go includes optional additional aligners at no charge for a period of up to two years after initial shipment 

we determined that our treatment plans comprise the following performance obligations that also represent distinct deliverables initial aligners additional aligners case refinement and replacement aligners we elected to take the practical expedient to consider shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the performance obligation we allocate revenues for each treatment plan based on each unit’s ssp and recognize the revenues upon shipment as the customers obtain physical possession and we have enforceable rights to payment as we collect most consideration upfront we considered whether a significant financing component exists however as the delivery of the performance obligations are at the customer’s discretion we concluded that no significant financing component exists 

scanner 

we sell intraoral scanners and cadcam services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and unlimited scanning services the customer may also select for additional fees extended warranty and unlimited scanning services for periods beyond the initial year when intraoral scanners are sold with an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenues based on the respective ssps of the scanner and the subscription service we estimate the ssp of each element taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies revenues are then recognized over time as the monthly services are rendered and upon shipment for the scanner as that is when we deem the customer to have obtained control most consideration is collected upfront and in cases where there are payment plans consideration is collected by the one year mark and therefore there are no significant financing components 

warranties 

for both clear aligner and scanner segments we offer an assurance warranty which provides the customer assurance that the product will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreedupon specifications and thus is not treated as a separate performance obligation and will continue to be accrued in accordance with the financial accounting standards board guidance on guarantees 

volume discounts 

in certain situations we offer promotions in which the discount will increase depending upon the volume purchased over time we concluded that in these situations the promotions can represent either variable consideration or options depending upon the specifics of the promotion in the event the promotion contains an option the option is considered a material right and therefore included in the accounting for the initial arrangement we estimate the average anticipated discount over the lifetime of the promotion or contract and apply that discount to each unit as it is sold on a quarterly basis we review our estimates and if needed updates are made and changes are applied prospectively 

accrued sales return reserve 

we accrue for sales return reserve based on historical sales returns as a percentage of revenue 

costs to obtain a contract 

we offer a variety of commission plans to our salesforce each plan has multiple components to match the costs to obtain a contract to the associated revenue we evaluate the individual components and capitalize the eligible components recognizing the costs over the treatment period 

unfulfilled performance obligations for clear aligners and scanners 

our unfilled performance obligations as of december 31 2018  and the estimated revenues expected to be recognized in the future related to these performance obligations are 4318 million this includes performance obligations from the clear aligner segment primarily the shipment of additional aligners which are fulfilled over one to five years and performance obligations from the itero scanner segment primarily support and contracted deliveries of additional scanners which are fulfilled over one to five years the estimate includes both product and service unfulfilled performance obligations and the time range reflects our best estimate of when we will transfer control to the customer and may change based on customer usage patterns timing of shipments readiness of customers facilities for installation and manufacturing availability 

contract balances 

the timing of revenue recognition results in deferred revenues being recognized on our consolidated balance sheet for both aligners and scanners we usually collect the total consideration owed prior to all performance obligations being performed with payment terms varying from net 30 to net 180 days contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenue balances which are generated based upon timing of invoices and recognition patterns not payments if the revenue recognition exceeds the billing the exceeded amount is considered unbilled receivable and a contract asset conversely if the billing occurs prior to the revenue recognition the amount is considered deferred revenue and a contract liability 

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the respective reporting units based on relative synergies generated 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 

we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in performing the qualitative assessment we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as our actual and planned financial performance we also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed if after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment no further testing is performed however if we conclude otherwise the first step of the twostep impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value including goodwill refer to  note 6 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on goodwill 

finitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of acquisitions and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

we evaluate longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our longlived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment the estimation of fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions and the structure that would yield the highest economic value among other factors refer to  note 6 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the impairment analysis 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statement of operation in the period in which such determination is made 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realized 

the us tax cuts and jobs act was enacted into law on december 22 2017 which included provisions for certain foreignsourced earnings referred to as global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” gilti imposes a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations fasb guidance issued in january 2018 allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either i account for gilti as a component of tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred the “period cost method” or ii account for gilti in the measurement of deferred taxes the “deferred method” we have made the election to record gilti tax using the period cost method

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our investments include fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 1076 million  invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure we do not have material interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2018  and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will 

not harm our business in the future we generally sell our products in the local currency of the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are generally denominated in their local currencies regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 

  

in march 2018 we started entering into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the gains and losses on these forward contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being economically hedged these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally are one month in original maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes as our international operations grow we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates it is difficult to predict the impact forward contracts could have on our results of operations the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2018  was not material 

although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use forward contracts to minimize the effect of these fluctuations the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting billions of people or approximately 60 to 75 of the population annually approximately 10 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and may be augmented with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer appliance of the 10 million annual orthodontic cases started approximately 60 or 6 million are applicable to invisalign treatment  our served market in addition approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth but are unlikely to seek treatment through a doctor’s office this represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using invisalign clear aligners and connect them with an invisalign doctor of their choice 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  the invisaligntrained dental professional prepares and sends us a patient’s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition the invisaligntrained dental professional can also submit an intraoral digital scan instead of a physical pvs impression through either aligns itero scanner or several thirdparty scanners see third party scanners and digital scans for invisalign treatment submission more than 50 of invisalign case submissions are submitted via digital scan instead of a physical pvs impression 

preparation of computersimulated treatment plan  using propriety software which we do not sell we generate a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan the clincheck treatment plan simulates appropriate tooth movement in stages and details timing and placement of any features or attachments that will be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement 

review and approval of the treatment plan by an invisalign provider  the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan 

manufacture of custom aligners upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology a form of 3d printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each 

mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the clincheck treatment plan 

shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear  all the aligners for a patient are shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals throughout the treatment aligners are generally worn for a period of time which correspond to the stages of the approved clincheck treatment plan the patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and resulting clincheck treatment plan in october 2016 we introduced oneweek aligner wear at the treating doctor’s discretion we recommend changing from twoweek aligner wear to oneweek aligner wear for invisalign treatments with invisalign full invisalign teen invisalign assist invisalign lite and invisalign go products thereby reducing treatment time by up to 50 align’s recommendation is based on clinical analysis of more than 200 inprogress invisalign cases data on file and the experiences of numerous invisalign providers 

additional aligners  should the dental professional determine that the treatment is not tracking for various reasons such as patient compliance certain teeth movement not tracking to plan or they need to extend the treatment a few stages further to achieve their treatment goals the dental professional can request additional aligners at no charge at any point during the treatment subject to certain requirements

smiledirectclub aligners  on july 25 2016 we entered into a supply agreement with smiledirectclub llc sdc to manufacture noninvisalign clear aligners for sdcs doctorled athome program for simple teeth straightening in october 2016 we became sdcs exclusive thirdparty supplier and began supplying aligners directly to sdc sdc aligners include up to 20 stages without attachments or interproximal reduction ipr align manufactures the aligners per sdc’s specifications for minor tooth movement using ex30 our proprietary aligner material used prior to the introduction of smarttrack align does 

not market or sell sdc products and ships supply of aligners directly to sdc when requested refer to supply agreement with smiledirectclub llc section 

noncase products 

clear aligner noncase products include retention products invisalign training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 

retention  we offer two products for post treatment retention the first is a single set of custom clear aligner retainers the second is offered as a set of four custom clear aligners called vivera retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse if necessary a shipment of four sets are available to both invisalign and noninvisalign patients 

feature enhancements 

we have consistently introduced enhanced features across the invisalign system over the past several years to improve treatment outcomes or address broader clinical indications feature enhancements are marketed primarily under an invisalign “g” series and have included invisalign g3 launched in october 2010 invisalign g4 launched in november 2011 invisalign g5 launched in february 2014 invisalign g6 launched in march 2015 and invisalign g7 launched in october 2016 

invisalign teen with mandibular advancement launched in march 2017 is the first clear aligner solution for class ii correction in growing tween and teen patients this new offering combines the benefits of our clear aligner system with features for moving the lower jaw forward while simultaneously aligning the teeth invisalign with mandibular advancement offers a simpler more efficient and patientfriendly treatment option than functional appliances and without the need for elastics typically used to treat teen class ii patients invisalign teen with mandibular advancement is available is most country markets however it is pending 510k clearance in the us and is not yet available for use 

smarttrack ™  aligner material 

smarttrack is a patented customengineered invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear but smarttrack maintains more constant force over the period of time the patient wears the aligners the flexible smarttrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment 

scanner segment 

intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of the patients teeth digital scan using a handheld intraoral scanner inside the mouth digital scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the mess discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions the digitally scanned model is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction the digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis orthodontic retainers and appliances and invisalign digital impression submission 

itero scanner  the itero element scanner launched in september 2015 is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures we market and sell the itero element in north america and in select international markets the itero scanner is interoperable with our invisalign treatment such that a full arch digital scan can be submitted as part of the invisalign case submission process in addition the invisalign outcome simulator and invisalign assessment tool are exclusive to the itero scanner prior to the launch of itero element we sold the itero 29 scanner 

restorative software for itero software designed for gps prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons which includes restorative workflows providing them with the ability to send digital impressions to the lab of choice and communicate seamlessly with external treatment planning custom implant abutment chairside milling and laboratory cadcam systems 

orthodontic software for itero software designed for orthodontists for digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis and for the fabrication of printed models and retainers 

cadcam services 

itero models and dies an accurate physical model and dies are manufactured based on the digital scan and sent to the laboratory of the dentist’s choice for completion of the needed restoration the laboratory also has the option to export the digital file for immediate production of coping and fullcontour restorations on their laboratory cadcam systems the laboratory conducts then completes the ceramic buildup or staining and glazing and delivers the end result  a precisely fitting restoration itero prosthetics have a nearzero remake rate 

orthocad icast icast provides a digital alternative to traditional stone cast models which allows for simplified storage and digital record retrieval the icast digital model contains a full american board of orthodontics abo base and is available from an itero scan or from a traditional alginate impression 

orthocad irecord irecord scans provide a digital alternative to traditional stone cast models which allows for simplified storage and digital record retrieval irecord scan data may also be exported to orthodontic laboratories for the fabrication of retainers orthodontic appliances and hard model fabrication 

third party scanners and digital scans for invisalign treatment submission  we support an open systems approach to digital scans and other intraoral scanning companies interested in qualifying their scanners to submit a digital impression in place of a traditional pvs impression as part of the invisalign case submission process we have qualified third party scanners for digital scan submission including 3m™ true definition scanner the sirona cerec omnicam scanner and certain 3shape trios scanners information regarding legal proceedings associated with the scanner may be found in item 3  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  “legal proceedings” 

itero applications and tools 

invisalign outcome simulator  the invisalign outcome simulator is an exclusive chairside and cloudbased application for the itero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of invisalign treatment through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current dentition next to hisher simulated final position after invisalign treatment 

invisalign 3d assessment tool the invisalign progress assessment tool provides the ability to compare a patient’s new scan with a specific stage of their clincheck treatment plan to visually assess and communicate invisalign treatment progress with an easy to read colorcoded tooth movement report that allows the doctor to know how each tooth is tracking 

timelapse timelapse technology allows doctors or practitioners to compare a patient’s historic 3d scans to the presentday scan enabling clinicians to identify and measure orthodontic movement tooth wear and gingival recession this highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions 

our itero element scanner includes the invisalign outcome simulator invisalign 3d assessment tool and timelapse as well as the orthodontic software andor restorative software the orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee additional applications such as the invisalign outcome simulator are not available for sale separately 

other proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck and clincheck pro software the invisalign doctor site   and enhanced feature solutions such as invisalign g7 are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items to revenue

supply agreement with smiledirectclub llc 

on july 28 2016 we announced a supply agreement with smiledirectclub llc to manufacture noninvisalign clear aligners for sdc’s doctorled athome program for affordable cosmetic teeth straightening the agreement brings our manufacturing and production expertise to a new and growing segment of the adult treatment market one that provides new treatment choices to consumers and new business opportunities to invisalign providers 

beginning october 2016 we became sdc’s exclusive thirdparty supplier for its minor tooth movement aligner program specifically we provide a case setup through sdc’s smilecheck viewer portal and upon review and approval by a participating licensed orthodontist or general dentist in sdc’s network we manufacture clear aligners and ship them directly to sdc while we are sdcs only thirdparty supplier sdc also manufactures some of their own aligners 

sdc aligners include up to 20 stages without attachments or ipr we manufacture the aligners per sdc’s specifications for minor tooth movement using ex30 align does not market or sell sdc products 

in addition under the agreement align and sdc created a new invisalign doctor referral program similar to the invisalign doctor locator that systematically refers a portion of case assessments that are too complex for their minor tooth movement product to invisalign providers in the patient’s local area the goal of the agreement is to help expand the market and opportunity for our invisalign doctors while supporting sdc’s efforts to provide consumers with access to more choices in treating simple cases from the convenience of their own home the invisalign brand and system of clear aligners continue to be available exclusively for in office treatment with invisaligntrained orthodontists and general dentists 

manufacturing and suppliers 

our manufacturing facilities are located in juarez mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribute and repair our scanners and perform our cadcam services and in or yehuda israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand and perform the final assembly of our itero scanner our invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for itero restorative cases are conducted primarily at our facility located in san jose costa rica however in 2017 we opened new treatment planning facilities in chengdu china and cologne germany to support our customers within these regions information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source the need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs see item 1a  risk factors — “we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and   operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases” 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused primarily on the invisalign system and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and gps worldwide in north america europe certain asia pacific country markets and more recently in brazil and certain countries in the middle east and africa we have direct sales and support organizations which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration we also have distribution partners that sell the invisalign system in smaller noncore international country markets we continued to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in select country markets 

  

for the itero scanner we have a small team of direct sales representatives and a few distributors in north america who leverage leads generated by our invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows we sell the itero scanner in select country markets internationally and will expand to additional markets over time to grow the scanner business 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 64400 active invisalign providers 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans our research and development expenses were 976 million  757 million  and 612 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms these activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2017  we had 420 active us patents 456 active foreign patents and 416 pending global patent applications 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements certain of our issued us patents expired in 2017 in addition corresponding foreign patents will start to expire in 2018 our active us patents expire between 2018 and 2035 when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us which could negatively impact our operating results however we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends within our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve for example european sales of invisalign treatments are often weaker in the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our scanner segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

all invisalign treatments are individually unique and prescribed by a doctor so no two cases are alike the period from which a treatment data package or a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our invisalign backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future invisalign revenues our quarterly invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter we define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where credit and financing is approved and payment is reasonably assured but the scanner has not yet shipped our intraoral scanner backlog as of december 31 2017  was not material 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive market and we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we also face competition from early stage companies although the number of competitors varies by segment currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us including danaher corporation sirona dental systems inc dentsply international inc 3m company straumann holding ag 3shape angel align and other private competitors in addition the expiration of certain of key patents which commenced in 2017 may result in additional competition information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “ risk factors ” 

key competitive factors include 

 

we believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

in order for us to market our products we must obtain regulatory authorization and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations both within and outside the us these regulations including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country failure to obtain regulatory approval and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market or plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines the approval by government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain and may not be granted on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our products are classified as medical devices under the united states food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the us to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the fda our products may also be regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries in which they are produced or sold in the european union eu our products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission which was updated in april 2017 to the medical device regulation such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations 

we believe we are in compliance with all fda federal and state laws and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations 

we are also subject to various laws inside and outside the us concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products as a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federal funded programs such as medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us to multinational requirements in the eu in the us final regulations implementing amendments to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the hipaa omnibus rule in the eu align must comply with the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which serves as a harmonization of european dataprivacy laws the gdpr goes into effect may 25 2018 meanwhile the asia pacific region has also seen rapid development of privacy laws including in china south korea singapore hong kong and australia we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 8715 employees including 5705 in manufacturing and operations 1830 in sales and marketing which includes customer care 475 in research and development and 705 in general and administrative functions

 item 1a risk factors 

we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our net revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign treatment for any reason or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

we expect that net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily invisalign full and invisalign teen will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines for any reason including as a result of a shift in product mix towards lower priced products our operating results would be harmed 

competition in the markets for our products is intense and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us in addition as a result of the expiration of certain key patents owned by us which began in 2017 we expect that existing competitors such as danaher corporation dentsply sirona inc straumann ag 3m 3shape and angel align as well as new entrants into the clear aligner market such as startups will begin offering an orthodontic system more similar to ours in the near future several of these competitors will likely have greater resources as well as the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us and therefore our share of the clear aligner market could decline which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition in addition corresponding foreign patents will start to expire in 2018 which will likely result in increased competition in some of the markets outside the us large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we also face competition from companies that now offer clear aligner therapy directly to the consumer eliminating the need for the consumer to visit a dental office in addition we may also face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us in san jose costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds in 2017 we opened new treatment planning facilities in chengdu china and cologne germany to support our customers within these regions our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico and we also have order acquisition for the emea region in amsterdam the netherlands we will continue to establish additional order acquisition and treatment planning facilities closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our north america facilities we also carry out research and development in moscow russia we also have customercare accounts receivable customer event registration and accounts payable organizations located in san jose costa rica in addition we have operations in israel where the design and wand are assembled and our intraoral scanner is manufactured our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 



 

if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in the highgrowth markets our international operations are subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

outside of north america we currently sell our products in certain countries within europe asia pacific latin america and the middle east and may expand into other countries from time to time for sales of our products outside the us we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all which could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the us economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on elective or higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners in addition invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to 

 

if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and produce enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with invisalign since it typically takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline 

the frequency of use of the invisalign system by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of the invisalign system by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues 

we provide volumebased discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we change the volumebased discount accounting that affects our average selling prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs in the future or participation in these programs increases or if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected and our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future we have in the past and may in the future enter into currency hedging transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations these transactions may not operate to fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity at our existing facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects we are establishing additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency and provide doctors with a better experience to further improve their confidence in using invisalign to treat more patients more often our ability to plan construct and equip additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a facility such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors any of which may be out of our control if the transition into these additional facilities is significantly delayed or demand for our product exceeds our current expectations we may not be able to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business in addition because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin production of our intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity 

constraints due to a variety of factors including our dependency on third party vendors for key components in addition to limited production yields any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results 

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our net revenues while controlling our expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have not in the past and may not in the future be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 



 

 

 

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products to our customers if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and gross margin could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer technology requiring new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the time frame our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is primarily processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both locations in costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural 

disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our corporate headquarters in california is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences we are in a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes which includes the transition to a new enterprise resource planning erp software system we implemented the first phase of our erp on july 1 2016 and while we believe we are past any potential significant business disruption we are still monitoring and troubleshooting potential issues the implementation of additional functionality in the erp system entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data additionally if we are not able to accurately forecast expenses related to the project this may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third party and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties which we depend upon may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the clincheck and myaligntech software software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss we have experienced such breaches in the past and our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are also perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures we have experienced such breaches in the past and our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors or other technical malfunctions hacking or phishing attacks by third parties employee error or malfeasance or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our customer and patient’s expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation and competition position could be impaired affected parties could initiate legal or regulatory action against us which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders forcing us to modify our business practices concerns over our privacy practices could adversely affect others’ perception of us and deter customers advertisers and partners from using our products in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

we are also subject to several federal state and foreign laws and regulations including ones relating to privacy data protection content regulation and consumer protection these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and may be interpreted applied created or amended in a manner that could adversely affect our business 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2017  we had 420 active us patents 456 active foreign patents and 416 pending global patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws certain of our key patents began to expire in 2017 which may result in increased competition or less expensive alternatives to our products we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation interferences oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews or other proceedings are have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights and in other instances to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products litigation interference oppositions reexams inter partes reviews post grant reviews administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted expensive and distracting to management the outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including our transition of further business operations into our erp software system and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

  

  if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable minimum purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 

we rely on a third party manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our itero element scanner as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate acceptable terms we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed 

if our distributor relationships are not successful our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected 

we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in various geographic regions and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons including 

 complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that 

we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

in addition as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify and discourage the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals additional reporting obligations are being proposed by the european union the us requirements and any additional requirements in europe could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our products for example these disclosure requirements may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our material sourcing is broad based and multitiered and we may be unable to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products we may suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these disclosure requirements including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business in response to perceived increases in health care costs congress passed health care reform legislation that was signed into law in march 2010 this legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless 

of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments impairments in the value of our investments and receivables could negatively impact our financial results 

  

we have invested in smiledirectclub llc sdc and other privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments many of such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data if we determine that our investments and receivables in sdc or other privately held companies have experienced a decline in value we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules relate to stockbased compensation revenue recognition and leases 

if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in an unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

on july 1 2016 we changed our corporate structure however if we are unable to maintain this structure or if it is challenged by us or foreign tax authorities we may be unable to realize tax savings which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we implemented a new international corporate structure on july 1 2016 this corporate structure may reduce our overall effective tax rate over time through changes in the structure of our international procurement and sales operations as well as realignment of the ownership and use of intellectual property among our whollyowned subsidiaries 

the structure includes legal entities located in jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the us federal statutory tax rate such intercompany arrangements would be designed to result in income earned by such entities in accordance with arm’slength principles and commensurate with functions performed risks assumed and ownership of valuable corporate assets we believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the us federal statutory rate will have a beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate over the medium to long term 

if the structure is challenged by us or foreign tax authorities if changes in domestic and international tax laws negatively impact the structure including the us tax cuts and jobs act enacted into law on december 22 2017 or if we do not operate our business in a manner consistent with the structure and applicable regulatory provisions we may fail to achieve the financial and operational efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the structure and our business financial condition and net income may be materially and adversely affected 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements nondeductible goodwill impairments changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings with the adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201609 we also anticipate our first quarter effective tax rate to vary significantly due to the timing of when majority of our equity compensation vests each year other quarters can also be impacted depending on the timing of equity vests 

in addition our tax rate may be impacted by tax holidays or incentives in june 2017 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted an extension of certain income tax incentives for an additional twelve year period under these incentives all of the income in costa rica is subject to a reduced tax rate in order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire a specified number of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2017 2016 and 2015 as a result of these incentives our income taxes were reduced by 18 million 191 million and 327 million in the year ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 002 023 and 040 in the year ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income 

as a us multinational corporation we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the us changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws could affect our income tax provision and net income or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business on december 22 2017 the us enacted significant tax reform and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us in addition governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws for example the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions in 2015 the oecd issued and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business

in the course of aligns operations align is involved in a variety of claims suits investigations and proceedings including actions with respect to intellectual property claims patent infringement claims government investigations labor and employment claims breach of contract claims tax and other matters regardless of the outcome these proceedings can have an adverse impact 

on us because of defense costs diversion of management resources and other factors although the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and aligns view of these matters may change in the future as litigation and events related thereto unfold align currently does not believe that these matters individually or in the aggregate will materially affect aligns financial position results of operations or cash flows  refer to note 8 legal proceedings of the notes to consolidated financial statement s for details on legal proceedings

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning device for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers set forth in the  business strategy  section in this annual report on form 10k 

the successful execution of our business strategy in 2018 and beyond may be affected by a number of other factors including 

 

 

 invisalign utilization rates   of cases shipped divided by  of doctors cases were shipped to 

 we expect that over the longterm our utilization rates will gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology which continue to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign in addition since the teenage market makes up 75 of the 10 million total orthodontic case starts each year and as we continue to drive adoption of teenage patients through sales and marketing programs we expect our utilization rate to improve in 2017 255 of our volume was from teenagers starting treatment with invisalign an increase of 404 from 2016 our utilization rates however may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors including seasonal trends in our business along with adoption rates of new products and features 

 



refer  to item 1a risk factors  “as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity at our existing facilities” for information on related risk factors and refer to note 9 commitments and contingencies of the notes of consolidated financial statements for more information on the costa rica purchase agreements and the china investment agreement

provision for income taxes in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

our provision for income taxes was 1302 million  512 million  and 421 million  for the year ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively representing effective tax rates of 357  211  and 226  respectively 

the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tcja” was enacted into law on december 22 2017 and impacted our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 the tcja made significant changes to the internal revenue code including but not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 we have estimated the impact of the tcja and recorded a provisional amount of 843 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 this provisional amount includes income tax expenses related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities of 104 million and the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings in the amount of 739 million the provisional impact of the tcja is discussed further in note 13 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 primarily due to certain foreign earnings most significantly from the netherlands and costa rica being taxed at lower tax rates and excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation recognized as a reduction of income tax expense partially offset by certain onetime tax charges recorded as a result of the tcja the increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to tax charges recorded as a result of the tcja and the tax benefit recognized pursuant to the release of valuation allowance against our israel deferred tax assets in 2016 that did not recur this year partially offset by excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in accordance with asu 201609 and increased tax benefits from foreign earnings being taxed at lower tax rates the increase in the effective rate for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily related to our international corporate restructuring as explained below 

on july 1 2016 we implemented a new international corporate structure this changed the structure of our international procurement and sales operations as well as realigned the ownership and use of intellectual property among our whollyowned subsidiaries we continue to anticipate that an increasing percentage of our consolidated pretax income will be derived from and reinvested in our foreign operations we believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the us federal statutory rate will have a beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate over time although the license of 

intellectual property rights between consolidated entities did not result in any gain in the consolidated financial statements the company generated taxable income in certain jurisdictions in 2016 resulting in a tax expense of 343 million additionally as a result of the restructuring we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence given the current earnings and anticipated future earnings of our subsidiary in israel we concluded that we have sufficient positive evidence to release the valuation allowance against our israel operating loss carryforwards of 314 million which resulted in an income tax benefit in 2016 

in june 2017 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted an extension of certain income tax incentives for an additional twelve year period under these incentives all of the income in costa rica is subject to a reduced tax rate in order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire a specified number of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2017 2016 and 2015 as a result of these incentives our income taxes were reduced by 18 million 191 million and 327 million in the year ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 002 023 and 040 in the year ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively  refer to note 13 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on income taxes

in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify customers vendors lessors and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 

it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period as of december 31 2017  we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies   of the notes to consolidated financial statements  under item 8 

revenue recognition 

we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered in one reporting period we measure and allocate revenue according to the accounting guidance for multipleelement revenue arrangements in accounting standards codification “asc” 60525  revenue recognition – multipleelement arrangements  

each element within a multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products the arrangement consideration is allocated to each element delivered or undelivered at the inception of the arrangement based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting we use a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to elements based first on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists second on thirdparty evidence “tpe” if it exists or on best estimated selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe exist a description as to how we determine vsoe tpe and besp is provided below 

 

 

 

revenue recognition for multipleelement arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting and if so the fair value for each of the elements and the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units our process for determining besps requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable further while changes in the allocation of the best estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

clear aligner 

we enter into arrangements “treatment plans” that involve multiple future product deliverables invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist products include optional additional aligners at no charge for a period of up to five  years after initial shipment and invisalign go includes optional additional aligners at no charge for a period of up to two years after initial shipment invisalign teen also includes up to six  optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered by the dental professional any time throughout treatment invisalign lite includes one optional case refinement in the price of the product case refinement is a finishing tool used to adjust a patients teeth to the desired final position and may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment 

we determined that our treatment plans except invisalign assist with progress tracking comprise the following deliverables which also represent separate units of accounting initial aligners additional aligners case refinement and replacement aligners we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each units relative selling price based on besp and recognize the revenue upon shipment of each unit in the treatment plan 

for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature aligners and services are provided to the dental professional every nine stages a batch” we are able to reliably estimate the number of batches which are expected to be shipped for each case based upon our historical experience the amounts allocated to this deliverable are recognized on a prorated basis as each batch is shipped 

scanners and services 

we sell intraoral scanners and cadcam services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and unlimited scanning services the customer may for additional fees also select extended warranty and unlimited scanning services for periods beyond the initial year when intraoral scanners are sold with an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenue based on each elements relative selling price we estimate the selling price of each element as if it is sold on a standalone basis taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies 

  stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares we estimate the fair value of marketperformance based restricted stock units using a monte carlo simulation model which requires the input of assumptions including expected term stock price volatility and the riskfree rate of return in addition judgment is required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future we adopted the asu 201609   improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  topic 718 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and we elected to continue to estimate expected forfeitures rather than as they occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period 

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the respective reporting units based on relative synergies generated for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 all goodwill is attributed to our clear aligner reporting unit 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of acquisitions and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

impairment of goodwill finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 

we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in performing the qualitative assessment we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as our actual and planned financial performance we also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed if after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment no further testing is performed however if we conclude otherwise the first step of the twostep impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value including goodwill refer to  note 6 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on intangible longlived assets 

finitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our longlived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment the estimation of fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions and the structure that would yield the highest economic value among other factors refer to  note 6 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the impairment analysis 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realized 

the tcja was enacted into law on december 22 2017 and impacted our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 the tcja made significant changes to the internal revenue code including but not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 

on december 22 2017 staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 was issued to address the application of gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the tcja we recorded an additional income tax expense of 843 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 which represents the provisional amount of the impact of the tcja this provisional amount includes income tax expenses related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities of 104 million and the onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earning in the amount of 739 million additional work is necessary for a more detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our historical foreign earnings as well as potential correlative adjustments any subsequent adjustment to these amounts will be recorded to tax expense in 2018 when the analysis is complete refer to note 13 income taxes of the notes of consolidated financial statements for details on provision impact of the tcja

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 3120 million  invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2017  and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

as a result of our international business activities including the impact of the change in our new international corporate structure in 2016 our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we generally sell our products in the local currency of the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are generally denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended december 31 2017  and 2016 we had foreign currency net gains losses of 90 million and 80 million respectively 

  

we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the gains and losses on these forward contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being economically hedged these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally are one month in original maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes as our international operations grow we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates it is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities could have on our results of operations as of december 31 2017  we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts 

although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting billions of people or approximately 60 to 75 of the population annually approximately 10 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 50 or 5 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign treatment  our served market in addition approximately 100 million people with malocclusion want to straighten their teeth however they will not seek orthodontic treatment in a doctors office and would instead elect to receive clear aligner treatment in the convenience of their own home  referred to as the doctordirected at home market 

in the us orthodontists and gps treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and they may augment braces with elastics metal expanders headgear or functional appliances and other ancillary devices as needed available options for improving treatment aesthetics include the use of ceramic toothcolored brackets or bonding brackets on the inside or lingual surface of the patient’s teeth the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement known in the industry as “chair time” including the initial diagnosis creation of an appropriate treatment plan and bonding of the brackets to the patient’s teeth and attachment of arch wires to the brackets subsequent visits involve tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks until the final visit when the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient’s teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer gps may also combine orthodontic treatment with restorative treatment many times the dental professional may need to move certain teeth or roots out of the way to create more space for implant placement or move teeth to create space for restorations of missing teeth in addition gps may need to move or adjust teeth or spaces to be able to place better restorations the orthodontic portion of treatment generally comes before the restorative portion 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable orthodontic aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  the invisaligntrained dental professional prepares and sends us a patient’s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition the invisaligntrained dental professional can also submit an intraoral digital scan instead of a physical pvs impression through either aligns itero scanner or several thirdparty scanners see third party scanners 

preparation of computersimulated treatment plan  upon receipt we use the treatment data package to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition in cases where a pvs impression has been submitted we use computed tomography known as ct scanning to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition in cases where the dental professional submits a digital scan this step in the process is eliminated we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan the clincheck treatment plan simulates 

appropriate tooth movement broken down into a series of increments and details timing and placement of any attachments that will be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement 

review and approval of the treatment plan by an invisalign provider  the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan 

manufacture of custom aligners upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology a form of 3d printing technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the clincheck treatment plan 

shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear  all the aligners for a patient are shipped directly to the dental professional who then dispenses them to the patient at regular checkup intervals throughout the treatment aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods or less which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment plan the patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and resulting clincheck treatment plan in october 2016 we introduced oneweek aligner wear at the treating doctor’s discretion we recommend changing from twoweek aligner wear to oneweek aligner wear for invisalign treatments with invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist products thereby reducing treatment time by up to 50 align’s recommendation is based on clinical analysis of more than 200 inprogress invisalign cases data on file and the experiences of numerous invisalign providers 

treatment progress and request for additional aligners  should the dental professional determine that the treatment is not tracking for various reasons such as patient compliance certain teeth not tracking to plan or they need to extend the treatment a few stages further to achieve their treatment goals the dental professional can request additional aligners at no charge at any point during the treatment subject to certain requirements 

clear aligner products

smiledirectclub aligners  on july 25 2016 we entered into a supply agreement with smiledirectclub llc sdc to manufacture noninvisalign clear aligners for sdcs doctorled athome program for simple teeth straightening in october 2016 we became sdcs exclusive thirdparty supplier and began supplying aligners directly to sdc sdc aligners include up to 20 stages without attachments or interproximal reduction ipr align manufactures the aligners per sdc’s specifications for minor tooth movement using ex30 aligner material 

noncase products 

clear aligner noncase products include retention products invisalign training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 

retention  we offer two products for post treatment retention the first is a single set of custom clear aligner retainers the second is offered as a set of four custom clear aligners called vivera retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse if necessary a shipment of four sets are available to both invisalign and noninvisalign patients 

feature enhancements 

we have consistently introduced enhanced features across the invisalign system over the past several years such as invisalign g3 launched in october 2010 invisalign g4 launched in november 2011 invisalign g5 launched in february 2014 and invisalign g6 launched in march 2015 in october 2016 we launched invisalign g7 a set of features designed to deliver greater control of tooth movements and improved treatment outcomes 

invisalign g5 innovations for deep bite is engineered to improve clinical outcomes in deep bite treatment with invisalign treatment comprehensive features dedicated to deep bite treatment include new smartforce® features that are designed to level the curve of spee by improving control of anterior intrusion and premolar extrusion for more predictable deep bite treatments and precision bite ramps that are designed to disocclude the posterior teeth for improved efficiency in deep bite treatments 

invisalign g6 clinical innovations for first premolar extraction is engineered to improve clinical outcomes for orthodontic treatment of severe crowding and bimaxillary protrusion feature enhancements include new smartstage programmed tooth movements that optimize the progression of tooth movements and provide aligner activation engineered to eliminate unwanted tipping and unwanted anterior extrusion during retraction and new smartforce features that are designed to deliver the force systems necessary to achieve predictable tooth movements 

  

invisalign g7 builds on earlier invisalign gseries releases with new features to finetune certain tooth movements and deliver treatment outcome quality that invisalign providers expect particularly with teenage patients powered by invisalign smartstage technology that optimizes the staging and sequence of tooth movements and aligner activation for greater predictability invisalign g7 delivers better upper lateral control improved root control and features to address prevention of posterior open bites 

smarttrack ™  aligner material 

smarttrack is a proprietary customengineered invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear but smarttrack maintains more constant force over the period of time the patient wears the 

aligners the flexible smarttrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment 

scanner segment 

intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of the patients teeth digital scan using a handheld intraoral scanner inside the mouth digital scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the mess discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions the digitally scanned model is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction the digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis orthodontic retainers and appliances and invisalign digital impression submission 

itero scanner  the itero scanner is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures in march 2015 we announced our next generation itero element intraoral scanner which features a more compact footprint enhanced wand and multitouch display and is engineered to enable faster scan speeds for more efficient realtime clinical evaluation we began shipping the itero element intraoral scanner in september 2015 we market and sell the itero element in north america and in select international markets the itero scanner is interoperable with our invisalign treatment such that a full arch digital scan can be submitted as part of the invisalign case submission process in addition the invisalign outcome simulator and features are exclusive to the itero scanner 

restorative software for itero software designed for gps prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons which includes features for restorative procedures commonly performed in their practices such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implants the itero restorative software provides the ability to scan quadrants and full arches and allows simple powderfree capture of digital impressions for singleunit cases as well as more complex restorative and implant treatment plans the itero software also contains invisalign interoperability to support clear aligner orthodontic treatment 

orthodontic software for itero software designed for orthodontists for digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis invisalign digital impression submission and for the fabrication of printed models and retainers the itero orthodontic software digitally captures the contours of the dentition and the gingival structures providing an accurate powderfree digital orthodontic scan in just minutes this digital impression procedure ensures a more comfortable patient experience and produces a precise scan that can be seamlessly integrated with invisalign treatment orthocad icast and orthocad irecord which allows a doctor to utilize sophisticated measurement and treatment planning tools 

cadcam services 

itero models and dies an accurate physical model and dies are manufactured based on the digital scan and sent to the laboratory of the dentist’s choice for completion of the needed restoration the laboratory also has the option to export the digital file for immediate production of coping and fullcontour restorations on their laboratory cadcam systems the laboratory conducts then completes the ceramic buildup or staining and glazing and delivers the end result  a precisely fitting restoration itero prosthetics have a nearzero remake rate 

orthocad icast icast provides a digital alternative to traditional stone cast models which allows for simplified storage and digital record retrieval the icast digital model contains a full american board of orthodontics abo base and is available from an itero scan or from a traditional alginate impression 

orthocad irecord irecord scans provide a digital alternative to traditional stone cast models which allows for simplified storage and digital record retrieval irecord scan data may also be exported to orthodontic laboratories for the fabrication of retainers orthodontic appliances and hard model fabrication 

third party scanners and digital scans for invisalign treatment submission  we support an open systems approach to digital scans and other intraoral scanning companies interested in qualifying their scanners to submit a digital impression in place of a traditional pvs impression as part of the invisalign case submission process we have qualified several scanners for digital scan submission including 3m™ true definition scanner january 2014 the sirona cerec omnicam scanner march 2015 and certain trios scanners october 2016 

chair side applications 

invisalign outcome simulator  the invisalign outcome simulator is an exclusive chairside and cloudbased application for the itero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of invisalign treatment through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current dentition next to hisher simulated final position after invisalign treatment using a full arch digital scan the invisalign outcome simulator takes a few minutes to run and may be viewed chairside on the scanner or from a computer using myaligntechcom intuitive tools allow doctors to make realtime adjustments to individual teeth during consultations that increase patient education and the likelihood of patient acceptance in october 2016 we introduced the following new features in the 40 upgrade 

 

 

our itero scanner includes orthodontic software andor restorative software and the invisalign outcome simulator the orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee the invisalign outcome simulator is not available for sale separately 

other proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck and clincheck pro software the invisalign doctor site   and enhanced feature solutions such as invisalign g7 are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue   

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers international orthodontists utilization gp dentists treat  refer and patient demand  conversion 

 

 



invisalign outcome simulator application that provides our customers with the ability to compare a patient’s new scan with a specific stage of their clincheck treatment plan to visually assess and communicate invisalign treatment progress 

 

supply agreement with smiledirectclub llc 

on july 28 2016 we announced a supply agreement with smiledirectclub llc sdc to manufacture noninvisalign clear aligners for sdc’s doctorled athome program for affordable cosmetic teeth straightening the agreement brings our manufacturing and production expertise to a new and growing segment of the adult treatment market one that provides new treatment choices to consumers and new business opportunities to invisalign providers 

beginning october 2016 we became sdc’s exclusive thirdparty supplier for its minor tooth movement aligner program specifically we provide a case setup through sdc’s smilecheck viewer portal and upon review and approval by a participating licensed orthodontist or general dentist in sdc’s network we manufacture clear aligners and ship them directly to sdc 

sdc aligners include up to 20 stages without attachments or interproximal reduction ipr we manufacture the aligners per sdc’s specifications for minor tooth movement using ex30 aligner material the invisalign brand and system of clear aligners continue to be available exclusively for in office treatment with invisaligntrained orthodontists and general dentists 

in addition under the agreement align and sdc created a new invisalign doctor referral program similar to the invisalign doc locator that systematically refers the approximately 30 of sdc’s smilecheck case assessments that are too complex for their minor tooth movement product to invisalign providers in the patient’s local area the goal of the agreement is to help expand the market and opportunity for our invisalign doctors while supporting sdc’s efforts to provide consumers with access to more choices in treating simple cases from the convenience of their own home 

manufacturing and suppliers 

our manufacturing facilities are located in juarez mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribute and repair our scanners and perform our cadcam services and in or yehuda israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand the final assembly of our itero scanner is performed by a third party manufacturer located in israel our invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for itero restorative cases are conducted primarily at our facility located in san jose costa rica information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica in addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we 

maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source the need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs see item 1a  risk factors — “we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and   operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases” 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused primarily on the invisalign system and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and gps worldwide in north america europe and certain asia pacific country markets and more recently in brazil and certain regions in the middle east and africa we have direct sales and support organizations which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration we also have distribution partners that sell the invisalign system in smaller noncore country markets outside of north america we continued to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales coverage professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in selected country markets 

  

for the itero scanner we have a small team of direct sales representatives in north america our intraoral scanner sales team leverages leads generated by our invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows we sell the itero scanner in select country markets internationally and will expand to additional markets over time to grow the scanner business 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps in 2016  we had approximately 54480 active invisalign providers 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans our research and development expenses were 757 million  612 million  and 528 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms these activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2016  we had issued 425 us patents 370 foreign issued patents and 386 pending global patent applications 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements our issued us patents expire between 2017 and 2035 in addition corresponding foreign patents will start to expire in 2018 when patents expire we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us which could negatively impact our operating results however we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading  “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends related to our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve for example european sales of invisalign treatment are often weaker in the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our scanner segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the individualized nature of an invisalign treatment which is prescribed by a doctor no two cases are alike thus we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which a treatment data package or “a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our invisalign backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future invisalign sales our quarterly invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter we define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where payment is reasonably assured and credit and financing is approved but the scanner has not yet shipped our intraoral scanner backlog as of december 31 2016  was not material 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive market and we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we also face competition from early stage companies although the number of competitors varies by segment currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us including danaher corporation sirona dental systems inc dentsply international inc 3m company and other private competitors in addition the expiration of certain of our key patents commencing in 2017 may result in additional competition information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “ risk factors ” 

key competitive factors include 

 

we believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

in order for us to market our products we must obtain regulatory authorization and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations both within and outside the us these regulations including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country failure to obtain regulatory approval and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market or plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines the approval by government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain and may not be granted on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of our products are classified as medical devices under the united states food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the us to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the united states fda our products may also be regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries in which they are produced or sold in the european union eu our products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations 

we believe we are in compliance with all fda federal and state laws and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations 

we are also subject to various laws inside and outside the us concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products as a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federally funded programs such as medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties for example the us federal physician payment sunshine act went into effect in 2014 which requires public transparency of transfers of value to physicians 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us to multinational requirements in the eu in the us final regulations implementing amendments to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the hipaa omnibus rule the eu is currently considering a proposal to enact legislation governing data protection which would transform the current mix of european countries’ laws to one overarching multinational law meanwhile the asia pacific region has also seen rapid development of privacy laws including in singapore hong kong and australia we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 6060 employees including 3970 in manufacturing and operations 1270 in sales and marketing which includes customer care 430 in research and development and 390 in general and administrative functions

 item 1a risk factors 

we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our net revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign treatment for any reason or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

we expect that net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily invisalign full and invisalign teen will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed 

competition in the markets for our products is intense and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us many of these manufacturers including danaher corporation sirona dental systems inc dentsply international inc and 3m have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do in addition as a result of the expiration of certain key patents owned by us commencing in 2017 we expect that these existing competitors as well as new entrants into the clear aligner market will begin offering an orthodontic system more similar to ours in the near future several of these competitors will likely have greater resources as well as the ability to leverage their existing channels in the dental market to compete directly with us and therefore our share of the clear aligner market could decline which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation and financial condition in addition corresponding foreign patents will start to expire in 2018 which will likely result in increased competition in some of the markets outside the us large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we also face competition for companies that now offer clear aligner therapy directly to the consumer eliminating the need for the consumer to visit a dental office in addition we may also face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in san jose costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico and starting in july 2016 we transitioned order acquisition for emea region to our facility in amsterdam the netherlands in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our north america facilities we also carry out research and development in moscow russia we also have customercare accounts receivable credit and collections customer event registration and accounts payable organizations located at our facility in san jose costa rica in addition we have operations in israel where the design and wand assembly and our intraoral scanner are manufactured our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 



 

if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

in addition president donald trump and his administration have made recent statements regarding the possibility of changing the way in which the international operations of us companies are taxed including through the implementation of a border tax tariff or increase in custom duties on products manufactured in countries outside of the us such as mexico and imported into the us in the event such taxes tariffs increased custom duties or other measures are implemented they could have a materially adverse effect on our business and or operating results and we may have to consider relocating some of our international operations 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the us and increase the localization of our products and services we expect to continue to increase our sales and presence outside the us particularly in the highgrowth markets our international operations are subject to risks that are customarily encountered in nonus operations including 

 

 

 

 



any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

outside of north america we currently sell our products in europe asia pacific latin america and the middle east and may expand into other countries from time to time for sales of our products outside the us we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all which could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the us economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners in addition invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products 

the frequency of use of the invisalign system by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of the invisalign system by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues 

we provide volume based discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs in the future or participation in these programs increases or if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected and our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced in july 2015 we launched a new product policy called additional aligners at no charge that addresses one of our customers top complaints with this product policy change we no longer distinguish between midcourse correction and case refinements and allow doctors to order additional aligners to address either treatment need at no charge subject to certain requirements based on this product policy beginning in the third quarter of 2015 we deferred more revenue as a result of providing free additional aligners for eligible treatments additionally as we grandfathered over 1 million open cases we will recognize lower revenues as additional aligners are shipped for at least the following two years until these cases complete 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars 

using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future we have in the past and may in the future enter into currency hedging transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations these transactions may not operate to fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity at our existing facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects in the near term we intend to establish additional order acquisition and treatment planning facilities closer to our international customers in order to improve our operational efficiency and provide doctors with a better experience to further improve their confidence in using invisalign to treat more patients more often our ability to plan construct and equip additional order acquisition treatment planning and manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a facility such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors any of which may be out of our control if the transition into this additional facility is significantly delayed or demand for our product exceeds our current expectations we may not be able to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business in addition because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our facility capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin production of our intraoral scanners may also be limited by capacity constraints due to a variety of factors including our dependency on third party vendors for key components in addition to limited production yields any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results 

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our net revenues while controlling our expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have not in the past and may not in the future be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 



 

 

 

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to 

 

if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and produce enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with invisalign since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products to our customers if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and operating profits could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer technology requiring new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the timeframe our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both locations in costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our corporate headquarters facility in california is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences we are in a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes which includes the transition to a new enterprise resource planning erp software system we implemented the first phase of our erp on july 1 2016 and while we believe we are past any potential significant business disruption we are still monitoring and troubleshooting potential issues the implementation of additional functionality in the erp system entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data additionally this implementation may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert managements attention from other operational activities negatively affect employee morale or have other unintended consequences additionally if we are not able to accurately forecast expenses related to the project this may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security or our cloudbased software servers hosted by third party and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties which we depend upon may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the clincheck and myaligntech software software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation 

possible liability and loss our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2016  we had issued 425 us patents 370 foreign issued patents and 386 pending global patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation interferences oppositions inter partes reviews or other proceedings are have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights and in other instances to determine the validity scope or noninfringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture use or sale of our products litigation interference oppositions inter partes reviews administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted expensive and distracting to management the outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions including our transition to a new erp software system and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

  

  if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 

we rely on a third party manufacturer to supply key subassemblies for our itero element scanner as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate acceptable terms we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed 

if our distributor relationships are not successful our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected 

we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in various geographic regions and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons including 

 complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that 

we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

in addition as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify and discourage the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals additional reporting obligations are being proposed by the european union the us requirements and any additional requirements in europe could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our products for example the implementation of these disclosure requirements may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our material sourcing is broad based and multitiered and we may be unable to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products we may suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these disclosure requirements including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years congress passed health care reform legislation that was signed into law in march 2010 this legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless 

of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

we are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments impairments in the value of our investments could negatively impact our financial results 

  

we have invested in smiledirectclub llc sdc and other privately held companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives and we may not realize a return on our strategic investments many of such companies generate net losses and the market for their products services or technologies may be slow to develop further valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data if we determine that our investments in sdc or other privately held companies have experienced a decline in value we may be required to record impairments which could be material and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we review our goodwill and longlived asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting 

policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules relate to stockbased compensation revenue recognition and leases 

if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in a current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

on july 1 2016 we changed our corporate structure however if we are unable to maintain this structure or if it is challenged by us or foreign tax authorities we may be unable to realize tax savings which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 

we implemented a new international corporate structure on july 1 2016 this corporate structure may reduce our overall effective tax rate over time through changes in the structure of our international procurement and sales operations as well as realignment of the ownership and use of intellectual property among our whollyowned subsidiaries 

the structure includes legal entities located in jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the us federal statutory tax rate such intercompany arrangements would be designed to result in income earned by such entities in accordance with arm’slength principles and commensurate with functions performed risks assumed and ownership of valuable corporate assets we believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the us federal statutory rate will have a beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate over the medium to long term 

if the structure is challenged by us or foreign tax authorities if changes in domestic and international tax laws negatively impact the structure including proposed legislation to reform us taxation of international business activities or if we do not operate our business in a manner consistent with the structure and applicable regulatory provisions we may fail to achieve the financial and operational efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the structure and our business financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates new or changes to accounting pronouncements nondeductible goodwill impairments changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stockbased compensation settlement of income tax audits and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 

in addition our tax rate may be impacted by tax holidays or incentives in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of certain income tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 we intend to seek a renewal of these income tax incentives before they expire under these incentives all of the income in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to a reduced tax rate in order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30  for 2016  2015 and 2014 as a result of these incentives income taxes were reduced by 191 million  327 million  and 325 million  in the year ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the benefit of the tax holiday on diluted net income per share was 023  in the year ended december 31 2016 and 040  in each of the year ended december 31 2015 and 2014 our subsidiary in israel is under audit by the local tax authorities for calendar years 2006 through 2013 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could negatively impact our income tax provision and net income 

as a us multinational corporation we are subject to changing tax laws both within and outside of the us changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing tax laws could affect our income tax provision and net income or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws for example the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project which is focused on a number of issues including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions the oecd issued in 2015 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business in addition the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning device for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers set forth in the  business strategy  section in our annual report on form 10k 

the successful execution of our business strategy in 2017 and beyond may be affected by a number of other factors including 

 

 invisalign utilization rates   of cases shipped divided by  of doctors cases were shipped to 

 we expect that over the longterm our utilization rates will gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology which continue to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign however we expect that our utilization rates may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors including seasonal trends in our business along with adoption rates of new products and features 

 

 we believe that these investments will position us to increase our revenue and continue to grow our market share 

 

 

 

 

 

we expect the supply agreement to be incremental to revenue growth in 2017

clear aligner  north america 

north america net revenues increased by 700 million  in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by 827 million this increase was offset in part by lower average selling price asp which decreased net revenues by 127 million asp declined in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of higher promotional discounts of 219 million as well as an increase in net deferrals of 77 million primarily related to the full year effect of our new additional aligners product policy launched in july 2015 these declines were partially offset by price increases on our comprehensive products effective april 1 2016 which contributed 177 million to net revenues 

clear aligner  international 

international net revenues increased by 765 million  in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by 809 million this increase was offset in part by lower asp which decreased net revenues by 44 million asp declined in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of higher promotional discounts of 69 million as well as the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates of 68 million these declines were partially offset by the price increases on our comprehensive products effective april 1 2016 which contributed 57 million to net revenues as well as an increase in additional aligner revenue of 35 million 

clear aligner  noncase 

noncase net revenues consisting of training fees and ancillary product revenues increased by 116 million  in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to increased vivera volume both in north america and international

total net revenues increased by 839 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of case volume growth across all regions and products as well as increased noncase revenue 

clear aligner  north america 

north america net revenues increased by 521 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to case volume growth across all channels and products which increased net revenues by approximately 790 million these increases were offset in part by lower asp which decreased net revenues by 269 million the decrease in asp was primarily as a result of higher net revenue deferrals of 160 million which includes the impact of our new additional aligner product policy launched in july 2015 of 89 million and the impact of higher promotional discounts in 2015 as compared to 2014 of 117 million these decreases in asp were offset in part by the price increase effective april 1 2015 on our comprehensive products 

clear aligner  international 

international net revenues increased by 304 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by case volume growth across all products of 715 million this was partially offset by lower asp which decreased net revenues by approximately 411 million the decrease in asp was primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates primarily due to the weakening of the euro compared to the us dollar in 2015 compared to 2014 of 345 million and to a lesser extent higher net revenue deferrals of 78 million which includes the impact of our new additional aligner product policy launched in july 2015 of 47 million as well as higher promotional discounts of 63 million in 2015 compared to 2014 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in asp as we transitioned to direct sales in certain apac countries and emea regions as well as the price increase on our comprehensive products effective july 1 2015 

clear aligner  noncase 

noncase net revenues consisting of training fees and ancillary product revenues increased by 52 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increased vivera volume both in north america and international 

scanner 

scanner net revenues decreased by 38 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in scanner revenue offset in part by a slight increase in services revenue in march 2015 we announced our next generation scanner and began shipping the itero element scanner in september 2015 scanner revenues declined in 2015 primarily due to fewer scanners recognized and permanent price reductions on our previous generation scanner the increase in services revenue was primarily due to an increase in the volume of cadcam services resulting from a larger installed base of scanners

provision for income taxes in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

our provision for income taxes was 512 million  421 million  and 445 million  for the year ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively representing effective tax rates of 211  226  and 234  respectively our effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to certain foreign earnings primarily in costa rica and the netherlands which are subject to lower tax rates and the impacts from our new international corporate structure in 2016 partially offset by the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation charges and unrecognized tax benefits the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily related to our international corporate restructuring as explained below the decrease in the effective rate for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2014 is mainly due to a 18 million tax adjustment recorded in 2014 which related to prior periods 

our total gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties was 464 million and 394 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized we have elected to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 interest and penalties included in tax expense was 14 million and 07 million respectively our total interest and penalties accrued as of december 31 2016 was 21 million we do not expect any significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next twelve months 

we file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns our major tax jurisdictions are us federal and the state of california for us federal and state tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years before 2000 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to examination by foreign tax authorities for years before 2007 our subsidiary in israel is under audit by the local tax authorities for calendar years 2006 through 2013 

on july 1 2016 we implemented a new international corporate structure this changes the structure of our international procurement and sales operations as well as realigns the ownership and use of intellectual property among our whollyowned subsidiaries we continue to anticipate that an increasing percentage of our consolidated pretax income will be derived from and reinvested in our foreign operations we believe that income taxed in certain foreign jurisdictions at a lower rate relative to the us federal statutory rate will have a beneficial impact on our worldwide effective tax rate over time although the license of intellectual property rights between consolidated entities did not result in any gain in the consolidated financial statements the company generated taxable income in certain jurisdictions in 2016 resulting in a tax expense of 343 million additionally as a result of the restructuring we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence given the current earnings and anticipated future earnings of our subsidiary in israel we concluded that we have sufficient 

positive evidence to release the valuation allowance against our israel operating loss carryforwards of 314 million which resulted in an income tax benefit in this period of the same amount 

as of december 31 2016 our remaining valuation allowance was not material 

in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of certain income tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 we intend to seek a renewal of these income tax incentives before they expire under these incentives all of the income in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to a reduced tax rate in order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2016 2015 and 2014 as a result of these incentives our income taxes were reduced by 191 million 327 million and 325 million in the year ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 023 in the year ended december 31 2016 and 040 for both the year ended december 31 2015 and 2014 

as of december 31 2016 approximately 4380 million of undistributed earnings from nonus operations held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us we maintain sufficient cash reserves in the us and do not intend to repatriate our foreign earnings as a result us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on these foreign earnings if these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes we intend to use the undistributed earnings for local operating expansions and to meet local operating working capital needs in addition a significant amount of the cash earned by foreign subsidiaries has been and will continue to be utilized to affect the new international corporate structure described above 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had the following cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm marketable securities in thousands

as of december 31 2016  approximately 4590   million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the us the costs to repatriate our foreign earnings to the us would likely be material however our intent is 

to permanently reinvest our earnings from foreign operations and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our us operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our current revolving line of credit

investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 728  million for the year ended december 31 2016  which primarily consisted of maturities and sales of our marketable securities of 6040 million  these inflows were partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of 4056 million  property plant and equipment purchases of 706 million  including the implementation of our new erp system and 467 million related to our equity interest investment in smiledirectclub llc sdc 

for 2017 we expect to invest 2200 million to 2500 million on capital expenditures primarily for our purchase of a new corporate headquarters office new order acquisition facility in singapore and other additional manufacturing and capacity to support our international expansion although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 

net cash used in investing activities was 1664 million for the year ended december 31 2015 which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of 4471 million and property plant and equipment purchases of 535 million for additional manufacturing capacity and infrastructure including the project to implement a new erp system which we started in late 2014 these uses were partially offset by 3341 million of maturities and sales of our marketable securities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2016 million for the year ended december 31 2014 which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of 4372 million and property plant and equipment purchases of 241 million these uses were partially offset by 2598 million of maturities and sales of our marketable securities 

financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities was 955  million for the year ended december 31 2016  primarily resulting from a common stock repurchase of 962 million   refer to note 10 common stock repurchase program of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on the stock repurchase program and 299 million  of payroll taxes paid for vesting of restricted stock units rsus through share withholdings partially offset by excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements of 168 million  and proceeds from issuance of common stock of 138 million  

net cash used by financing activities was 1008 million for the year ended december 31 2015 resulting from repurchases of our common stock of 1018 million and 207 million of payroll taxes paid for our employees vesting of rsus through share withholdings partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of 113 million and 104 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements 

net cash used by financing activities was 664 million for the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from repurchases of our common stock of 982 million and 76 million of payroll taxes paid for our employees vesting of rsus through share withholdings partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of 180 million and 214 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements 

as restricted stock units are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our employees will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2016  2015  and 2014  we paid 299  million 207  million and 76  million respectively for taxes related to rsus that vested during the periods the cash paid for 

taxes related to rsus in 2016 and 2015 increased in comparison to 2014 due to the company changing its policy in mid 2014 to pay for employees payroll taxes related to their vesting rsus instead of requiring employees to sell to cover for their payroll taxes 

stock repurchases 

refer to note 10 common stock repurchase program of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on stock repurchase program 

 

 

 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with our positive cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to suspend our stock repurchase program or seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

on march 22 2013 we entered into a credit facility for a 500 million revolving line of credit with a 100 million letter of credit sublimit and has a maturity date on march 22 2018  refer to note 7 credit facility   of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the credit facility  

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 



our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 451 million of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2016  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2016  

indemnification provisions 

in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify customers vendors lessors and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 

it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period as of december 31 2016  we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies   of the notes to consolidated financial statements  under item 8 

revenue recognition 

we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered in one reporting period we measure and allocate revenue according to the accounting guidance for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements in accounting standards update “asu” 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangementsa consensus of the financial accounting standard board “fasb” emerging issues task force  

each element within a multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products the arrangement consideration is allocated to each element delivered or undelivered based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting based first on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists second on thirdparty evidence “tpe” if it exists or on best estimated selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe exist a description as to how we determine vsoe tpe and besp is provided below 



other market and company specific factors are made as deemed necessary in determining besp we regularly review our estimates of selling price and maintain internal controls over the establishment and update of these estimates 

judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions to determine the best estimated selling price for each accounting unit and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units further while changes in the allocation of the best estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

clear aligner 

we enter into arrangements “treatment plans” that involve multiple future product deliverables invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist products comprehensive products include optional additional aligners at no charge for a period of up to five years after initial shipment invisalign teen also includes up to six optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered by the dental professional any time throughout treatment invisalign lite noncomprehensive products includes one optional case refinement in the price of the product case refinement is a finishing tool used to adjust a patients teeth to the desired final position and may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment 

we determined that our treatment plans except invisalign assist with progress tracking comprise the following deliverables which also represent separate units of accounting initial aligners additional aligners case refinement and replacement aligners we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each units relative selling price based on besp and recognize the revenue upon shipment of each unit in the treatment plan 

for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature aligners and services are provided to the dental professional every nine stages “a batch” we are able to reliably estimate the number of batches which are expected to be shipped for each case based upon our historical experience the amounts allocated to this deliverable are recognized on a prorated basis as each batch is shipped 

scanners and services 

we sell intraoral scanners and cadcam services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and unlimited scanning services the customer may for additional fees also select extended warranty and unlimited scanning services for periods beyond the initial year when intraoral scanners are sold with an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenue based on each elements relative selling price we estimate the selling price of each element as if it is sold on a standalone basis taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies 

  stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares we estimate the fair value of marketperformance based restricted stock units using a monte carlo simulation model which requires the input of assumptions including expected term stock price volatility and the riskfree rate of return in addition judgment is required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the respective reporting units based on relative synergies generated for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 all goodwill is attributed to our clear aligner reporting unit 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of acquisitions and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

impairment of goodwill finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present an event occurs or circumstances changes that suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 

we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in performing the qualitative assessment we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as our actual and planned financial performance we also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed if after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment no further testing is performed however if we conclude otherwise the first step of the twostep impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value including goodwill refer to  note 5 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details on intangible longlived assets 

finitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our longlived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment the estimation of fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions and the structure that would yield the highest economic value among other factors refer to  note 5 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the impairment analysis 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new 

information to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realized

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 3108 million  invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2016  and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

as a result of our international business activities including the impact of our new international corporate structure in 2016 our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we generally sell our products in the local currency of the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are generally denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations for the year ended december 31 2016  and 2015 we had foreign currency net losses of 80 million and 40 million respectively 

  

in september 2015 we started to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the gains and losses on these forward contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being economically hedged these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally are one month in original maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes as our international operations grow we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates it is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities could have on our results of operations as of december 31 2016  we did not have any outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts 

although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

our products and services 

our net revenues are generated from the sale of the following product offerings 

  

  



clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting nearly a billion people or approximately 50 to 75 of the population of major developed countries approximately 68 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 26 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign treatment  our served market 

in the us orthodontists and gps treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices as needed available options for improving treatment aesthetics include the use of ceramic toothcolored brackets or bonding brackets on the inside or lingual surface of the patient’s teeth the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement known in the industry as “chair time” including the initial diagnosis creation of an appropriate treatment plan and bonding of the brackets to the patient’s teeth and attachment of arch wires to the brackets subsequent visits involve tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks until the final visit when the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient’s teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable orthodontic aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  the invisaligntrained dental professional prepares and sends us a patient’s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition the invisaligntrained dental professional can also submit an intraoral scan or “digital impression” instead of a physical pvs impression through either aligns itero scanner 3ms true definition or sironas cerec omnicam scanner currently the only other invisalign qualified intraoral scanners 

preparation of 3d computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data package to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition in cases where a pvs impression has been submitted we use computed tomography known as ct scanning to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition in cases where the dental professional submits a digital impression this step in the process is eliminated 

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck software  we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan the clincheck plan simulates appropriate tooth movement broken down into a series of twoweek increments and details timing and placement of 

any attachments that will be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan clincheck pro is the next generation invisalign treatment software tool designed to provide more precise control over final tooth position and to help invisalign providers achieve their treatment goals this latest software innovation features interactive 3d controls that for the first time allow invisalign providers to make adjustments to the position of individual teeth directly on the 3d model and to visualize the effects on the whole dentition in real time 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment  upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional  from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck animation aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment plan after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and resulting clincheck treatment plan 

retention  upon completion of the treatment the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product 

clear aligner products 

invisalign full  used for a wide range of malocclusion the invisalign full treatment consists of the number of aligners necessary to achieve the doctor’s treatment goals invisalign full treatment aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment invisalign full is sold in the us canada and our international regions the invisalign full product is included in invisalign full products 

invisalign teen the invisalign teen treatment includes all the features of invisalign full treatment plus additional features that address the orthodontic needs of teenage patients such as compliance indicators compensation for tooth eruption and six free single arch replacement aligners this product is predominantly marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teenage patients invisalign teen treatment aligners other than the replacement aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment invisalign teen is sold in the us canada and our international regions the invisalign teen product is included in invisalign full products 

invisalign assist used for anterior alignment and aestheticallyoriented cases the invisalign assist treatment offers added support to our dental practitioners throughout the treatment process including progress tracking that allows the dental professional to submit new impressions every nine stages when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages thereby helping to achieve successful treatment outcomes predominantly marketed to gps invisalign assist is intended to make it easier to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach submit cases more efficiently and manage appointments with suggested tasks invisalign assist is sold in the us and canada the invisalign assist product is included in invisalign full products 

invisalign express 10 and 5 and invisalign litei7 invisalign express treatment invisalign lite treatment and invisalign i7 treatment are lowercost solutions for less complex orthodontic cases noncomprehensive treatment relapse cases or straightening prior to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers invisalign express 10 and invisalign express 5 which are sold in the us and canada uses up to 10 and 5 sets of aligners respectively and are also available as a single arch option invisalign lite and invisalign i7 sold in our international regions uses up to 14 and 7 sets of aligners respectively for invisalign expresslitei7 aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment the invisalign express 10 and 5 products and invisalign lite i7 products are included in invisalign express products 

retention  we offer two products for post treatment retention the first is a single set of custom clear aligner retainers the second is offered as a set of four custom clear aligners called vivera retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse if necessary each set of vivera retainers is intended to be used for three 

consecutive months and deliver one year of retention doctors can prescribe vivera retainers for their invisalign and their noninvisalign patients 

invisalign noncase revenues  invisalign noncase revenues represent retainer products discussed above invisalign training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 

feature enhancements we have consistently introduced enhanced features across the invisalign system over the past several years such as invisalign g3 launched in october 2010 invisalign g4 launched in november 2011 and invisalign g5 launched in february 2014 in 2015 we did a phased launch of invisalign g6 clinical innovations for first premolar extraction these feature enhancements are a collection of clinical innovations designed to address some of the most significant treatment challenges doctors encounter 

 invisalign g5 is our first set of innovations designed specifically as an integrated solution to enhance treatment predictability for deep bite a specific type of malocclusion invisalign g5 feature enhancements include 

 

invisalign g6 is engineered to improve clinical outcomes for orthodontic treatment of severe crowding and bimaxillary protrusion invisalign g6 clinical innovations was launched in asia pacific europe middle east and africa and latin america geographies throughout 2015 and will be launched in north america in early 2016 invisalign g6 feature enhancements include 

 

 

smarttrack ™  aligner material smarttrack is a proprietary customengineered invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear but smarttrack maintains more constant force over the two weeks that a patient wears the aligners the flexible smarttrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment 

scanner segment 

intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of the patients teeth using a handheld intraoral scanner inside the mouth intraoral scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the mess discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions the digital model created with an intraoral scanner is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration remakes so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction the 3d digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments invisalign digital impression submission digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis and orthodontic retainers and appliances 

itero scanner  the itero scanner is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures the itero scanner includes our innovative powderless technology and features a modern design scanning wand and easytouse keyboard design with full color model rendering enabling clinicians to show patients a lifelike final model of their scanned dentition we market and sell the itero in north america and in select international markets 

the itero scanner is interoperable with our invisalign treatment such that a full arch digital scan can be submitted for the invisalign case submission process treatment in january 2014 we announced that we qualified the 3m™ true definition scanner for use with invisalign case submissions this qualification enables invisalign providers with a true definition scanner to submit a digital impression in place of a traditional pvs impression as part of the invisalign case submission process in march 2015 we announced that the sirona cerec omnicam with the new cerec ortho software 11 was qualified for use with invisalign case submissions the new cerec omnicam scanner was available in select markets in the summer of 2015 the 3m true definition scanner and sirona cerec omnicam scanner are the only thirdparty scanners that have been qualified for use with invisalign treatment we support an open systems approach to digital impressions and continue to work with intraoral scanning companies interested in developing interoperability for use with invisalign treatment 

in march 2015 we announced our next generation itero element intraoral scanner which features a more compact footprint enhanced wand and multitouch display and is engineered to enable faster scan speeds for more efficient realtime clinical evaluation we began shipping the itero element intraoral scanner in september 2015 and expect to ramp up our production over the next few quarters accordingly 

restorative software for itero software designed for gps prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons which includes features for restorative procedures commonly performed in their practices such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implants the itero restorative software provides the ability to scan quadrants and full arches and allows simple powderfree capture of digital impressions for singleunit cases as well as more complex restorative and implant treatment plans the itero software also contains invisalign interoperability to support clear aligner orthodontic treatment 

in the past year we have expanded the digital workflow options to include several partnerships which provide our customers with a broader spectrum of cadcam options connectivity partnership announcements include

chair side applications 

invisalign outcome simulator  the invisalign outcome simulator is an interactive application that provides gps and orthodontists an enhanced platform for patient education and is designed to increase treatment acceptance by helping patients visualize the benefits possible with invisalign treatment as the only invisalign chairside intraoral scanning application on the market the invisalign outcome simulators unique dual view layout shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current 

dentition next to hisher simulated final position of how their teeth may look after invisalign treatment using a full arch invisalign scan the invisalign outcome simulator takes a few minutes to run and may be viewed chairside on the scanner or from a computer using myaligntechcom intuitive tools allow doctors to make realtime adjustments to individual teeth during consultations that increase patient education and the likelihood of patient acceptance 

our itero scanner includes orthodontic software restorative software or both and the invisalign outcome simulator the orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee the invisalign outcome simulator is not available for sale separately 

other proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck and clincheck pro software the invisalign doctor site   and enhanced feature solutions such as invisalign g6 are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue   

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers market expansion doctor preference and brand strength 

 

in parallel with these investments we also engage in professional marketing clinical support and education initiatives that support doctor practice development and facilitate the continued growth of their practices 

in our itero scanner business we leverage our combined sales and marketing resources to facilitate the adoption and penetration of each product into our doctors’ practices many of our customers recognize that having an itero scanner at chairside improves practice effectiveness for invisalign as evidenced by higher invisalign utilization rates among customers with an itero scanner 

 

 8 

consumer purchase intent we accomplish this objective through an integrated consumer marketing strategy that includes television media social networking and event marketing 

manufacturing and suppliers 

our manufacturing facilities are located in juarez mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribute and repair our scanners perform our cadcam services and in or yehuda israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand the final assembly of our itero scanner is performed by a third party manufacturer located in israel our invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for itero restorative cases are conducted primarily at our facility located in san jose costa rica information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica in addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source the need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs see item 1a risk factors — “we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and   operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases” 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused primarily on the invisalign system and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and gps worldwide in north america europe and certain asia pacific country markets we have direct sales and support organizations which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration 

currently we have several distribution partners that sell the invisalign system in smaller noncore country markets in the emea asia pacific and latin america regions we evaluate adding distribution partners in other noncore country markets on a casebycase basis or assess modifying our current distribution agreements as our international business grows we continued to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales coverage professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in selected country markets 

  

for the itero scanner we have a small team of direct sales representatives in north america our intraoral scanner sales team leverages leads generated by our invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows we sell the itero scanner in select country markets internationally and will look to grow the scanner business over time 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps in 2015  we had approximately 48170 active invisalign providers 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans our research and development expenses were 612 million  528 million  and 441 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms our research and development activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2015  we had issued 384 us patents 276 foreign issued patents and 236 pending global patent applications 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends related to our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve for example european sales of invisalign treatment are often weaker in the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our scanner segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the individualized nature of an invisalign treatment which is prescribed by a doctor no two cases are alike thus we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which a treatment data package or “a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our invisalign backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future invisalign sales our quarterly invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter we define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where payment is reasonably assured and credit and financing is approved but the scanner has not yet shipped our intraoral scanner backlog as of december 31 2015  was not material 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive market and we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we also face competition from early stage companies although the number of competitors varies by segment currently our products compete directly 

against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc dentsply international inc and other private competitors in addition the expiration of certain key patents commencing in 2017 owned by us may result in additional competition information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “ risk factors ” 

key competitive factors include 

 

we believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

in order for us to market our products we must obtain regulatory authorization and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations both within and outside the united states these regulations including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country failure to obtain regulatory approval and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market or plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines the approval by government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain and may not be granted on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

certain of the company’s products are classified as medical devices under the united states food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the united states to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the united states food and drug administration “fda” our products may also be regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries in which they are produced or sold in the european union our products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states which are based on a directive of the european commission such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the fda regulations 

we believe we are in compliance with all fda federal and state laws and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations 

we are also subject to various laws inside and outside the us concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products as a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federally funded programs such as medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties for example the us federal physician payment sunshine act went into effect in 2014 which requires public transparency of transfers of value to physicians 

in addition we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us to multinational requirements in the eu in the us final regulations implementing amendments to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the hipaa omnibus rule the eu is currently considering a proposal to enact legislation governing data protection which would transform the current mix of european countries’ laws to one overarching multinational law meanwhile the asia pacific region has also seen rapid development of privacy laws including in singapore hong kong and australia we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 4375 employees including 2805 in manufacturing and operations 950 in sales and marketing which includes customer care 310 in research and development and 310 in general and administrative functions

 item 1a risk factors 

we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our net revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign treatment for any reason or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

we expect that net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily invisalign full and invisalign teen will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the us economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment 

such as intraoral scanners in addition invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products 

the frequency of use of the invisalign system by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of the invisalign system by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues 

we provide volume based discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs in the future or participation in these programs increases if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected and our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced in july 2015 we launched a new product policy called additional aligners at no charge that addresses one of our customers top complaints with this product policy change we no longer distinguish between midcourse correction and case refinements and allow doctors to order additional aligners to address either treatment need at no charge subject to certain requirements based on this new product policy beginning in the third quarter of 2015 we deferred more revenue as a result of providing free additional aligners for eligible treatments additionally as we grandfathered over 1 million open cases we will recognize lower revenues as additional aligners are shipped for at least the next two years until these cases complete 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements the exchange rate between the us dollar and foreign currencies has fluctuated substantially in recent years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future as a result beginning in september 2015 we began entering into currency hedging transactions in an effort to cover some of our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations these transactions may not operate to fully or effectively hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations and under certain circumstances these transactions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity at our existing facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects in addition in order to meet the demands from expected volumes we purchased a second manufacturing facility in juarez mexico we began manufacturing aligners in this second facility in september 2015 while continuing to manufacture aligners at our existing facility in juarez our ability to plan construct and equip additional manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a new manufacturing facility such as hiring and retaining employees and delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors any of which may be out of our control if the transition into this additional facility is significantly delayed or demand for our product exceeds our current expectations we may not be able to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business in addition because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to 

gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results 

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our net revenues while controlling our expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

 16 

 

 

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to 

 

if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and produce enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with invisalign since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market 

acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products to our customers if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and operating profits could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in san jose costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our north america facilities we also carry out research and development at locations in moscow russia in addition our customercare accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in san jose costa rica we also have operations in israel where the design and wand assembly and our intraoral scanner are manufactured our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

 18 

 

if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations as a result of these sales operations we face a variety of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

treatment planning is a key step leading to our manufacturing process which relies on sophisticated computer technology requiring new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the timeframe our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both locations in costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our headquarters facility in california is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences we are in the process of implementing a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions the implementation of additional functionality in the erp system entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data during transitions we must continue to rely on legacy information systems which may be costly or inefficient while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert managements attention from other operational activities negatively affect employee morale or have other unintended consequences additionally if we are not able to accurately forecast expenses and capitalized costs related to the project this may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties which we depend upon may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the clincheck and myaligntech software software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the markets for our products is intense and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us many of these manufacturers including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in 

the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive the expiration of certain key patents commencing in 2017 owned by us may result in additional competition large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2015 we had issued 384 us patents 276 foreign issued patents and 236 pending global patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report 

includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed in addition our ability to recognize revenue on the direct sales of our intraoral scanners depends in part upon our ability to schedule and staff trainings the loss of the services provided by these individuals or our ability to timely hire such personnel in sufficient numbers based on our volume growth may harm our business if we are unable to retain our trainers or replace such individuals with persons having equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise in newly hired personnel or accurately predict the number of such personnel needed our net revenues could be materially harmed 

  

  if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 

we rely on a third party manufacturer in the czech republic to supply key subassemblies for our itero element scanner as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components if we lose its services or if we fail to negotiate acceptable terms we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed 

if our distributor relationships are not successful our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected 

we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in various geographic regions and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons including 

 complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that 

we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

in addition as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify and discourage the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals additional reporting obligations are being proposed by the european union the us requirements and any additional requirements in europe could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our products for example the implementation of these disclosure requirements may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our material sourcing is broad based and multitiered and we may be unable to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products we may suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these disclosure requirements including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years congress passed health care reform legislation that president obama signed into law in march 2010 this legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

outside of north america we currently sell our products in europe asia pacific latin america and the middle east and may expand into other countries from time to time for sales of our products outside the us we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we review our goodwill and asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules relate to revenue recognition 

if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in a current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates nondeductible goodwill impairments changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans settlement of income tax audits and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 

in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of various income tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 under these incentives all of the income in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax in order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2015 2014 and 2013 as a result of these incentives our income taxes were reduced by 327 million 325 million and 277 million for the year ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 040 040 and 034 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively our subsidiary in israel is under audit by the local tax authorities for calendar years 2006 through 2012 we are currently under audit by the california franchise tax board for fiscal year 2011 2012 and 2013

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning device for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers set forth in the  business strategy  section in our annual report on form 10k 

the successful execution of our business strategy and our results in 2015 and beyond may be affected by a number of other factors including 

 based on this new product policy beginning in the third quarter of 2015 we deferred more revenue as a result of providing free additional aligners for eligible treatments additionally since we grandfathered over 1 million open cases we will recognize lower revenues as additional aligners are shipped we expect lower amounts of revenue to be recognized for at least the next two years until these cases complete in the fourth quarter of 2015 the new product policy decreased clear aligner net revenues by approximately 70 million and reduced operating margin by 22 and diluted earnings per share by 007 per share we expect a decrease in clear aligner net revenues by approximately 70 million to 80 million in the first quarter of 2016 and by approximately 250 million to 300 million in fiscal year 2016 while this product policy change will impact the timing of our revenue recognition we believe this policy change will result in a significant improvement in customer satisfaction and loyalty and ultimately increase invisalign utilization and volume over time 

 

 invisalign utilization rates   of cases shipped divided by  of doctors cases were shipped to 

total utilization in the fourth quarter of 2015 increased to 49 cases per doctor compared to 44 in the fourth quarter of 2014 utilization among our north american orthodontist customers reached an all time high of 99 cases per doctor in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 86 in the fourth quarter of 2014 international doctor utilization increased to 50 cases in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 45 in the fourth quarter of 2014 north american gp doctor utilization increased to 31 cases in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 29 in the fourth quarter of 2014 the increase in north america orthodontist utilization reflects improvements in product and technology which continues to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign such that they now utilize invisalign more often and on more complex cases including their teenage patients increased international utilization reflects growth in both the emea and asia pacific regions driven by gotomarket and sales coverage investments improving clinical education and support as well as ongoing technology innovation we expect that over the longterm our utilization rates will gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology which continue to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign however we expect that our utilization rates may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors including seasonal trends in our business along with adoption rates of new products and features

the foreign currency risk in countries where we have significant monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency the impact from these forward contracts was not material to our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015 

in addition as we plan for further international expansion over the next several years we must provide better support to our customers in these regions and be geographically closer to their practices accordingly we intend to make further investments in our manufacturing over the next few years to enhance our regional capabilities 

 we believe that these investments will position us to increase our revenue and continue to grow our market share

fiscal year 2015  compared to fiscal year 2014   

total net revenues increased by 839 million  in 2015  as compared to 2014  primarily as a result of invisalign case volume growth across all regions and products as well as increased invisalign noncase revenue 

clear aligner  north america 

clear aligner north america net revenues increased by 521 million  in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to invisalign case volume growth of approximately 790 million across all channels and products these increases were offset in part by lower average selling prices asp which decreased net revenues by 269 million the decrease in asp was primarily as a result of higher net revenue deferrals of 160 million which includes the impact of our new additional aligner product policy launched in july 2015 of 89 million and the impact of higher promotional discounts in 2015 as compared to 2014 of 117 million these decreases in asp were offset in part by the price increase on our full products effective april 1 2015 

clear aligner  international 

clear aligner international net revenues increased by 304 million  in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily driven by invisalign case volume growth of 715 million across all products this was partially offset by lower asp which decreased net revenues by approximately 411 million the decrease in asp was primarily as a result of the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates primarily due to the weakening of the euro compared to the us dollar in 2015 compared to 2014 of 345 million and to a lesser extent higher net revenue deferrals of 78 million which includes the impact of our new additional aligner product policy launched in july 2015 of 47 million as well as higher promotional discounts of 63 million in 2015 compared to 2014 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in asp as we transitioned to direct sales in certain asia pacific countries and europe middle east and africa regions as well as the price increase on our full products effective july 1 2015 

clear aligner  invisalign noncase 

invisalign noncase net revenues consisting of training fees and ancillary product revenues increased by 52 million  in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increased vivera volume both in north america and international 

scanner 

scanner net revenues decreased by 38 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in scanner revenue offset in part by a slight increase in services revenue in march 2015 we announced our next generation scanner which began shipping in september 2015 net revenues declined in 2015 primarily due to fewer scanners recognized and permanent price reductions on our previous generation scanner the increase in services revenue was primarily due to an increase in the volume of cadcam services resulting from a larger installed base of scanners 

fiscal year 2014  compared to fiscal year 2013   

total net revenues increased by 1014 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily as a result of invisalign case volume growth across all regions and products as well as increased invisalign noncase revenue 

clear aligner  north america 

clear aligner north america net revenues increased by 384 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to invisalign case volume growth of approximately 321 million across all channels and products and to a lesser extent higher asp which contributed approximately 63 million to the increase in net revenues the increase in asp was primarily a result of increased midcourse correction revenue from higher usage as well as a product mix shift towards higher priced invisalign products in 2014 compared to 2013 this increase was offset in part by higher promotional discounts in 2014 as compared to 2013 

clear aligner  international 

clear aligner international net revenues increased by 580 million in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by invisalign case volume growth of 462 million along with higher asp which contributed approximately 118 million to the increase in net revenues the increase in asp was primarily due to the impact from acquiring our distributor in the asia pacific region on april 30 2013 when we began recognizing direct sales of invisalign products sold in that region at our full asp rather than the discounted asp under the distributor agreement as well as the price increases which were effective july 2013 along with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenues in 2014 as compared to 2013 despite the weakening of the euro to the us dollar in the last six months of 2014 

clear aligner  invisalign noncase 

invisalign noncase net revenues consisting of training fees and ancillary product revenues increased by 15 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the consolidation of our vivera product shipments in north america from four shipments per year to one shipment along with increased vivera volume both in north america and international 

scanner 

scanner net revenues increased by 77 in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an increase in both services revenue as well as scanner revenue 

the increase in services revenue was primarily due to an increase in the volume of cadcam services resulting from a larger installed base of scanners the increase in scanner revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of scanners recognized offset in part by lower scanner asp as a result of promotional discounts as well as permanent price reductions the increase was partially offset as 2013 had higher net revenues due to the release of 14 million of revenue previously reserved for the itero upgrade program which was completed in the first quarter of 2013 

cost of net revenues and gross profit in millions 

  



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

cost of net revenues for our clear aligner and scanner segments includes salaries for staff involved in the production process the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process amortization of acquired intangible assets from cadent training costs and stockbased compensation 

fiscal year 2015  compared to fiscal year 2014   

clear aligner 

the gross margin percentage declined in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower asp which was partially offset by lower costs per unit 

scanner 

the gross margin percentage decreased in 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower asp from permanent price reductions on our previous generation scanner and higher manufacturing costs from lower production volumes and higher inventory reserves this was partially offset by a product mix shift to the lower cost element scanner which commenced shipping in september 

fiscal year 2014  compared to fiscal year 2013   

clear aligner 

the gross margin percentage improved slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher asp the asp improvement was mostly offset by increased manufacturing costs in 2014 when compared to 2013 which benefited from an out of period adjustment see note 1 in the financial statements  

scanner 

the gross margin percentage increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased absorption of manufacturing spend from higher production volumes lower product costs due to product mix and lower inventory reserves these were partially offset by a lower asp as a result of price reductions 

selling general and administrative in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

selling general and administrative expense includes personnelrelated costs including payroll commissions and stockbased compensation for our sales force marketing and administration in addition to media and advertising expenses clinical education trade shows and industry events product marketing outside consulting services legal expenses depreciation and amortization expense the medical device excise tax mdet and allocations of corporate overhead expenses including facilities and it 

selling general and administrative expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily   due to higher compensation related costs of 501 million as a result of increased headcount which led to higher salaries stock based compensation and commissions in addition consulting costs increased by 97 million primarily due to our enterprise resource planning erp project partially offsetting these increases was the mdet refund of 68 million received in the first quarter of 2015 

selling general and administrative expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily   due to higher compensation costs of 241 million due to increased headcount including the additional headcount from the acquisition of our apac distributor and stock based compensation in addition we incurred higher advertising and marketing expenses as a result of increased advertising production and marketing campaigns combined with higher costs for trade shows and our europe and apac summits as well as 

increases in consulting expenses and credit card processing fees these increases were offset by lower mdet of 68 million as our aligners were no longer subject to the excise tax in 2014 as well as lower outside litigation costs in march 2014 the irs informed us that our aligners are not subject to the mdet which we had been paying and expensing in selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations since january 1 2013

research and development expense includes the personnelrelated costs and outside consulting expenses associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products corporate allocations facility and facility related costs and stockbased compensation expense 

research and development expense increased during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of our investment in obstructive sleep apnea which was terminated in the third quarter of 2015 while we continue to believe that the opportunities in the obstructive sleep apnea market are potentially interesting we have decided to remain focused on our core business and organic growth opportunities 

research and development expense increased during 2014 compared to 2013 almost entirely due to higher compensation costs as a result of higher bonuses stockbased compensation and salaries primarily due to additional headcount 

impairment of goodwill in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

there was no charge for impairment of goodwill recorded in the years ended december 31 2015 or 2014 

during the first quarter of 2013 we determined that the goodwill for our scanner reporting unit should be tested for impairment as a result of changes in the competitive environment for intraoral scanners which caused us to lower our expectations for growth and profitability for our scanner reporting unit as a result of our analysis we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 407 million none of which was deductible for tax purposes refer to  note 5 goodwill and intangible assets of our consolidated financial statements  for details of the impairment analysis 

impairment of longlived assets in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

there was no charge for impairment of longlived assets recorded in the year ended december 31 2015 or 2014 

the impairment of our longlived assets in 2013 was the result of changes in the competitive environment for intraoral scanners which caused us to lower our expectations for growth and profitability for our scanner reporting unit as a result we determined that the carrying value of the longlived assets was not recoverable and therefore recorded an impairment charge of 263 million refer to note 5 goodwill and intangible assets of our consolidated financial statements for details of the impairment analysis 

interest and other income expense net in millions 



interest and other income expense net includes foreign currency translation gains and losses interest income earned on cash cash equivalents and investment balances and other miscellaneous charges 

interest and other income expense net in 2015 increased mainly due to higher interest income on higher balances of cash cash equivalents and investments offset in part by higher foreign exchange losses primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar to the euro and australian dollar 

interest and other income expense net in 2014 decreased due to higher foreign exchange losses primarily as a result of the weakening of the euro to the us dollar offset slightly by increased interest income earned on higher balances of cash cash equivalents and investments 

provision for income taxes in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

our provision for income taxes was 421 million  445 million  and 288 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively this represents effective tax rates of 226  234  and 310  respectively our effective tax rates in these fiscal years differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to certain foreign earnings primarily from costa rica which are subject to a lower tax rate the decrease in the effective rate for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2014 is mainly due to an additional 18 million tax adjustment recorded in 2014 which related to prior periods the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 also reflects a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 407 million 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 3598 million of undistributed earnings from nonus operations held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us accordingly no additional us income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes have been provided thereon we have sufficient cash reserves in the us and do not intend to repatriate our foreign earnings we intend to use the undistributed earnings for local operating expansions and to meet local operating working capital needs if these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets quarterly should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we do not expect to realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realizable the available positive evidence at december 31 2015 included historical operating profits a projection of future income and other objectively verifiable evidence as of december 31 2015 we 

believed except for the items noted in the subsequent paragraph that is was more likely than not that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet will be realized 

as of december 31 2015 we maintained a valuation allowance of 317 million against our deferred tax assets which primarily relate to israel operating loss carryforwards and australia capital loss carryforwards these net operating and capital loss carryforwards would result in an income tax benefit if we were to conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized the valuation allowance decreased from december 31 2014 by 08 million due to the decrease of foreign tax rate which resulted in lower tax impact on net operating and capital loss carryforwards we are currently evaluating an internal restructuring which may result in a future reassessment of our need for a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets as a result it is possible that we may realize a tax benefit which may have a material impact on the financial statements within the next twelve months 

  

as of december 31 2015 we have california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 205 million which if not used will begin to expire in 2016 in the event of a change in ownership as defined under federal and state tax laws our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations the annual limitations may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization as of december 31 2015 we had california research credit carryforwards of approximately 39 million that can be carried forward indefinitely 

we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we first determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon audit based on its technical merits if a tax position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information to the extent the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

our total gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest was 394 million and 331 million as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized we have elected to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes the accrued interest as of december 31 2015 was 07 million we do not expect any significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefit within the next twelve months 

in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201517    income taxes topic 740 to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes under the new standard both deferred tax liabilities and assets are required to be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet asu 201517 will become effective for fiscal years and the interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted the new guidance has been adopted on a prospective basis by the company for the year ended december 31 2015  thus resulting in the reclassification of 301 million of current deferred tax assets to noncurrent on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet the prior reporting period was not retrospectively adjusted the adoption of this guidance had no impact on our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of comprehensive income 

we file us federal us state and nonus income tax returns our major tax jurisdictions are us federal and the state of california for us federal and state tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years before 2000 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to examination by foreign tax authorities for years before 2007 our subsidiary in israel is under audit by the local tax authorities for calendar years 2006 through 2012 we are currently under audit by the california franchise tax board for fiscal year 2011 2012 and 2013 

in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of certain income tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 under these incentives all of the income in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rate of costa rica income tax in order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2015 2014 and 2013 as a result of these incentives our income taxes were reduced by 327 million 325 million and 277 million for the year ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 040 040 and 034 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively

as of december 31 2015  approximately 4425   million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the us the costs to repatriate our foreign earnings to the us would likely be material however our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from foreign operations and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our us operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our current revolving line of credit

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1664  million for the year ended december 31 2015  which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of 4471 million  and property plant and equipment purchases of 535 million  for additional manufacturing capacity and infrastructure including a project to implement a new enterprise resource planning system which we started in late 2014 these uses were partially offset by 3341 million  of maturities and sales of our marketable securities 

for 2016 we expect to invest 550 million to 650 million on capital expenditures primarily for additional manufacturing capacity and to establish order acquisition and treatment planning facility and our erp implementation although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 

net cash used in investing activities was 2016 million for the year ended december 31 2014 which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of 4372 million and property plant and equipment purchases of 241 million these uses were partially offset by 2598 million of maturities and sales of our marketable securities

financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities was 1008  million for the year ended december 31 2015  resulting from repurchases of our common stock of 1018 million   refer to note 10 common stock repurchase program of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the stock repurchase program   and 207 million  of payroll taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units rsus through share withholdings partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of 113 million  and 104 million  from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements 

net cash used by financing activities was 664 million for the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from repurchases of our common stock of 982 million and 76 million of payroll taxes paid for our employees vesting of rsus through share withholdings partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of 180 million and 214 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements 

net cash used by financing activities was 382 million for the year ended december 31 2013 resulting from repurchases of our common stock of 951 million and 44 million of payroll taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units through share withholdings partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of 342 million and 271 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements 

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting rsus which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercises as a result we will continue to generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods in addition because restricted stock units are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our employees will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2015  2014  and 2013  we paid 207  million 76  million and 44  million respectively for taxes related to rsus that vested during the periods the cash paid for taxes related to rsus in 2015 increased in comparison to 2014 due to the company changing its policy in mid 2014 to pay for employees payroll taxes related to their vesting rsus instead of requiring employees to sell to cover for their payroll taxes 

stock repurchase 

on april 23 2014 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may purchase up to 3000 million of our common stock over three years with 1000 million of that amount authorized to be purchased during each twelve month period any purchases under this stock repurchase program may be made from timetotime pursuant to open market purchases including pursuant to rule 10b51 plans privatelynegotiated transactions accelerated stock repurchases block trades or derivative contracts or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws including rule 10b18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 

as part of our 3000 million stock repurchase program we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement asr with goldman sachs  co on april 28 2014 to repurchase 700 million of our common stock we paid 700 million on april 29 2014 and received an initial delivery of approximately 10 million shares the asr was completed on july 29 2014 with a final delivery of approximately 04 million shares we received a total of approximately 14 million shares under the asr for an average purchase price per share of 5146 which all shares were retired the final number of shares repurchased was based on our volumeweighted average stock price during the term of the transaction less an agreed upon discount during 2014 we repurchased on the open market approximately 06 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 5093 per share including commissions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 282 million all repurchased shares were retired 

 in january 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of the next 1000 million under the repurchase program which we anticipate completing within twelve months on april 28 2015 we entered into an accelerated stock repurchase agreement 2015 asr to repurchase 700 million of our common stock the 2015 asr was completed on july 23 2015 we received a total of approximately 12 million shares for an average share price of 6052 under the 2015 asr which were all retired the 

final number of shares repurchased was based on our volumeweighted average stock price during the term of the transaction less an agreed upon discount in addition during the year ended december 31 2015 we repurchased on the open market approximately 05 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 5889 per share including commissions for an aggregate purchase price of 318 million all repurchased shares were retired as of december 31 2015 we have approximately 1000 million remaining under the april 2014 stock repurchase program we expect to finance future stock repurchases with current cash on hand 

credit facility 

on march 22 2013 we entered into a credit facility for a 500 million revolving line of credit with a 100 million letter of credit sublimit and has a maturity date on march 22 2016  refer to note 7 credit facility  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the credit facility  

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 



our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 401 million of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2015  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2015  

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities combined with our positive cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

indemnification provisions 

in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify customers vendors lessors and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 

it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period as of december 31 2015  we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8 

revenue recognition 

we enter into sales arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of our products and services where certain elements of the sales arrangement are not delivered in one reporting period we measure and allocate revenue according to the accounting guidance for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements in accounting standards update “asu” 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangementsa consensus of the financial accounting standard board “fasb” emerging issues task force  

each element within a multipleelement arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria are met the delivered products or services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by us we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer further our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products the arrangement consideration is then allocated to each element delivered or undelivered based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting based first on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists second on thirdparty evidence “tpe” if it exists or on best estimated selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe exist a description as to how we determine vsoe tpe and besp is provided below 

 

judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions to determine the best estimated selling price for each accounting unit and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units further while changes in the allocation of the best estimated selling price between the accounting units will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular arrangement any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

clear aligner 

we enter into arrangements “treatment plans” that involve multiple future product deliverables invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist products include optional additional aligners at no charge for a period of up to five years after initial shipment invisalign teen also includes up to six optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered by the dental professional any time throughout treatment invisalign lite includes one optional case refinement in the price of the 

product case refinement is a finishing tool used to adjust a patients teeth to the desired final position and may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment 

we determined that our treatment plans except invisalign assist with progress tracking comprise the following deliverables which also represent separate units of accounting singlebatched aligners additional aligners case refinement and replacement aligners we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each units relative selling price based on besp and recognize the revenue upon the delivery of each unit in the treatment plan 

for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature aligners and services are provided to the dental professional every nine stages “a batch” we are able to reliably estimate the number of batches which are expected to be shipped for each case based upon our historical experience the amounts allocated to this deliverable are recognized on a prorated basis as each batch is shipped 

scanners and services 

we sell intraoral scanners and cadcam services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and unlimited scanning services the customer may for additional fees also select extended warranty and unlimited scanning services for periods beyond the initial year when intraoral scanners are sold with an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenue based on each elements relative selling pricewe estimate the selling price of each element as if it is sold on a standalone basis taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies 

  stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares we estimate the fair value of marketperformance based restricted stock units using a monte carlo simulation model which requires the input of assumptions including expected term stock price volatility and the riskfree rate of return in addition judgment is required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the reporting units based on relative synergies generated 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of acquisitions and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

impairment of goodwill finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present an event occurs or circumstances changes that suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 

we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in performing the qualitative assessment we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as our actual and planned financial performance we also give consideration to the difference 

between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed if after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment no further testing is performed however if we conclude otherwise the first step of the twostep impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value including goodwill refer to  note 5 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements  for details of the impairment analysis 

finitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our longlived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment the estimation of fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions and the structure that would yield the highest economic value among other factors refer to  note 5 goodwill and intangible assets of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the impairment analysis 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realized

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 5110 million  invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2015  and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

we operate in north america europe asia pacific costa rica and israel as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we generally sell our products in the local currency of the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are generally denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by exchange rate fluctuations 

in september 2015 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables these forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the gains and losses on these forward contracts are intended to offset the gains and losses in the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being economically hedged these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally are one month in original maturity we do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes as our international operations grow we will continue to reassess our approach to managing the risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates it is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities could have on our results of operations the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december 31 2015  was not material 

although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

 item 1 business 

our company 

align technology inc “we” “our” “align” designs manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy intraoral scanners and cadcam computeraided design and computeraided manufacturing digital services used in dentistry orthodontics and dental records storage align technology was founded in march 1997 and incorporated in delaware in april 1997 our headquarters are located at 2560 orchard parkway san jose california 95131 and our telephone number is 4084701000 our internet address is wwwaligntechcom our international headquarters are located in amsterdam the netherlands 

we have two operating segments 1 clear aligner known as the invisalign system and 2 scanners and services scanner known as the itero intraoral scanner and orthocad services and formerly referred to as our scanners and cadcam services segment sccs for the year ended december 31 2014  clear aligner revenues represent approximately 94 percent of worldwide revenue while scanners represent the remaining 6 percent of worldwide revenues we distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers orthodontists and general practitioner dentists gps as well as to restorative dentists including prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons 

we received 510k clearance from the united states food and drug administration “fda” to market the invisalign system in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device in order to provide invisalign treatment to their patients orthodontists and gps must initially complete an invisalign training course the invisalign system is primarily sold through a direct sales force in the united states us canada europe and certain asia pacific countries including australia new zealand china and japan we use a distributor model for the sale of our products in noncore country markets in the asia pacific europe middle east and africa emea and latin america regions

clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting nearly a billion people or approximately 50 to 75 of the population of major developed countries approximately 68 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 26 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign treatment  our served market 

in the us orthodontists and gps treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices as needed available options for improving treatment aesthetics include the use of ceramic toothcolored brackets or bonding brackets on the inside or lingual surface of the patient’s teeth the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement known in the industry as “chair time” including the initial diagnosis creation of an appropriate treatment plan and bonding of the brackets to the patient’s teeth and attachment of arch wires to the brackets subsequent visits involve tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks until the final visit when the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient’s teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable orthodontic aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  the dental professional prepares and sends us a patient’s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition the dental professional can also submit an intraoral scan or “digital impression” instead of a physical pvs impression through either itero or 3m true definition currently the only other invisalign qualified intraoral scanner 

preparation of 3d computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data package to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition in cases where a pvs impression has been submitted we use computed tomography known as ct scanning to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition in cases where the dental professional submits a digital impression this step in the process is eliminated 

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck software  we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan the clincheck plan simulates appropriate tooth movement broken down into a series of twoweek increments and details timing and placement of any attachments that will be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan clincheck pro is the next generation invisalign treatment software tool designed to provide more precise control over final tooth position and to help invisalign providers achieve their treatment goals this latest software innovation features interactive 3d controls that for the first time allow invisalign providers to make adjustments to the position of individual teeth directly on the 3d model and to visualize the effects on the whole dentition in real time 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment  upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional  from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck animation aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment plan after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and resulting clincheck treatment plan 

retention  upon completion of the treatment the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product 

scanners and services segment 

although advancements have been made in materials used for taking dental impressions since their introduction one hundred years ago the overall impression process has remained relatively unchanged shortcomings such as voids pulls and the general margin for error have remained inherent in conventional impressions and subsequent retakes create unnecessary costs for a clinical practice intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of the patient’s teeth using a handheld intraoral scanner inside the mouth intraoral scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the mess discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions the digital model created with an intraoral scanner is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration “remakes” so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction 

as the only intraoral scanner in the market based on parallel confocal imaging the itero intraoral scanner utilizes laser and optical scanning to capture the contours of the patient’s dentition gingival structures and the bite itero captures 100000 points of laser light in perfect focus without the use of powder to coat the teeth allowing for contact of the wand and tooth the benefit of contact scanning for the clinician is that it eliminates the challenge of hovering over the teeth at a specific distance which can be complicated for the patient they enjoy a more comfortable powder free experience which allows the clinician to provide a very comfortable patient centric experience within minutes an accurate 3d digital impression can be viewed on the screen the 3d digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments invisalign digital impression submission digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis and orthodontic retainers and appliances 

the itero intraoral scanner consists of a mobile computer unit display screen control foot pedal and wand to scan and capture a patient’s dentition full or partial dental arch itero software features include occlusal map eraser tool edge trim tool realtime modeling and an option to submit scans for invisalign treatment itero provides doctors and labs with an open choice to export generic digital files of their digital impression to use with other third party dental service providers this allows the digital impression to integrate with cone beam ct images for implant and orthodontic treatment planning inoffice training on the system and features is provided after the unit is delivered to the practice

invisalign outcome simulator  in january 2013 we announced the commercial availability of the invisalign outcome simulator our first invisalign chairside application powered by the itero scanner the interactive application provides gps and orthodontists an enhanced platform for patient education and is designed to increase treatment acceptance by helping patients visualize the benefits possible with invisalign treatment as the only invisalign chairside intraoral scanning application on the market the invisalign outcome simulators unique dual view layout shows a prospective patient an image of hisher own current dentition next to hisher simulated final position of how their teeth may look after invisalign treatment using a full arch invisalign scan the invisalign outcome simulator takes a few minutes to run and may be viewed chairside on the scanner or from a computer using myaligntechcom intuitive tools allow doctors to make realtime adjustments to individual teeth during consultations that increase patient education and the likelihood of patient acceptance 

our itero scanner includes orthodontic software restorative software or both and the invisalign outcome simulator the orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee the invisalign outcome simulator is not available for sale separately 

other proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck and clincheck pro software the invisalign doctor site   and enhanced feature solutions such as invisalign g5 are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue   

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers market expansion doctor preference and brand strength 

 

in parallel with these investments we also engage in professional marketing clinical support and education initiatives that support doctor practice development and facilitate the continued growth of their practices 

in our itero scanner business we leverage our combined sales and marketing resources to facilitate the adoption and penetration of each product into our doctors’ practices many of our customers recognize that having an itero scanner at chairside improves practice effectiveness for invisalign as evidenced by higher invisalign utilization rates among customers with an itero scanner 

 8 

announced the upcoming release of invisalign g6 clinical innovations for first premolar extractions the nature of malocclusion that requires first premolar tooth extraction is an orthodontic problem that affects more than 50 of people in asia 20 in europe and 12 in north america secondly enhancing the customer’s experience by making it easier to treat with and integrate invisalign into their practices as an example we launched clincheck pro in february 2014 the next generation invisalign treatment software tool designed to simplify the treatment process and help our doctors achieve their treatment goals 

 

manufacturing and suppliers 

our manufacturing facilities are located in juarez mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribute and repair our scanners perform our cadcam services and in or yehuda israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand the final assembly of our itero scanner is performed by a third party manufacturer located in israel our invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for itero restorative cases are conducted primarily at our facility located in san jose costa rica information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica in addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source the need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs see item 1a risk factors — “we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and   operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases” 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused primarily on the invisalign system and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and gps worldwide in north america europe and certain asia pacific country markets we have direct sales and support organizations which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration 

currently we have several distribution partners that sell the invisalign system in smaller noncore country markets in the emea asia pacific and latin america regions we evaluate adding distribution partners in other noncore country markets on a casebycase basis or assess modifying our current distribution agreements as our international business grows we continued 

to expand in our existing markets through targeted investments in sales coverage professional marketing and education programs along with consumer marketing in selected country markets in addition given the significant long term potential the emea geography represents and the support we can now provide by utilizing our direct coverage model in europe beginning in february 2014 we began the transition of a small number of countries into direct sales regions we continued the transition of additional smaller countries during the year which will continue through february 2015 we expect to leverage our existing infrastructure and resources to bring sales coverage and customer support to these countries most of which are adjacent to our directly covered european countries due to the small volume of business from our emea distributor we do not anticipate that this transition will have a material effect on our financial results in the next several years 

  

for the itero scanner we have a small team of direct sales representatives in north america our intraoral scanner sales team leverages leads generated by our invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows we sell the itero scanner in select country markets internationally and will look to grow the scanner business over time 

we market invisalign by communicating the benefits of the invisalign system to dental professionals through our training programs online and traditional mail campaigns trade shows trade journals and print we also promote the benefits of invisalign through our integrated consumer marketing platform which combines traditional print and broadcast media with a balanced mix of public relations event marketing and social media the goal of this platform is to raise awareness of invisalign as the best options for a healthy beautiful smile among adults and teenagers in addition our consumer marketing platform enables us to help prospective patients find a great invisalign treatment practice that can meet their needs for intraoral scanners in addition to leveraging invisalign customer events and industry tradeshows to communicate the benefits of digital scanning to dental professionals we also have training programs educational websites and limited print advertising 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps in 2014  we had approximately 43340 active invisalign providers 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans our research and development expenses were 528 million  441 million  and 429 million  for the year ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms our research and development activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2014  we had 352 issued us patents 97 pending us patent applications and 257 foreign issued patents as well as 108 pending foreign patent applications 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends related to our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve for example european sales of invisalign treatment are often weaker in the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our scanner segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the individualized nature of an invisalign treatment which is prescribed by a doctor no two cases are alike and we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which a treatment data package or “a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our invisalign backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future invisalign sales our quarterly invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter we define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where payment is reasonably assured and credit and financing is approved but the scanner has not yet shipped our intraoral scanner backlog as of december 31 2014  was not material 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive market and we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we also face competition from early stage companies although the number of competitors varies by segment currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc and dentsply international inc information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

key competitive factors include 

 

we believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

in order for us to market our products we must obtain regulatory authorization and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations these regulations including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country failure to obtain regulatory approval and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market or plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines the approval by government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain and may not be granted on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe we are in compliance with all fda federal and state laws and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations countryspecific regulatory framework and requirements are highlighted in the following examples 

us 

in the us the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act fda act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations provide the fda with authority over medical devices and the research clinical testing manufacture labeling distribution sale and promotion of such devices medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i ii or iii the class to which the device is assigned determines among other things the type of premarketing submissionapplication required for market authorization our invisalign aligners and intraoral scanners are classified as class ii medical devices and we have obtained applicable 510k clearances for our marketed products 

the fda act also requires manufactured devices to comply with applicable quality system regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to design development manufacturing and quality assurance activities including the reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device we are subject to unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities to determine compliance with applicable regulations and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain instances by the federal trade commission the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in among other things warning letters fines injunctions civil penalties recall or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or approval for devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution the fda also has the authority to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 

european union 

the member states of the european union eu have adopted the european medical device directives mdd 9342eec that form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries the mdd defines the quality system safety and performance requirements to be met by manufacturers for their products called the essential requirements certification to iso 13485 an international standard for quality management systems demonstrates compliance with the quality system requirements outlined in the mdd our quality management system is iso 13485 certified by the british standards institute an approved full scope notified body as defined in the regulations 

canada 

in canada the system of approval for medical devices is governed by the medical device regulations of the department of justice sor98282 including quality system requirements based on iso 13485 facility registration and device licensing the scope of our quality management system certification includes the additional requirements defined by health canada 

japan 

in japan the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw regulates medical devices under the pharmaceutical affairs law pal manufacturers with no local presence in japan must appoint a marketing authorization holder mah to manage their device registration process and liaise with the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda japan’s medical device market regulator manufacturers of class ii iii and iv devices must implement a quality system compliant with the pal and mhlw ordinance 169 japan qms regulation and submit qms conformity assessment application the scope of our 

quality management system certification includes the additional requirements defined by pal and invisalign has been authorized for sale 

china 

  

in china the china food and drug administration cfda regulates medical devices the device classification process in china differs significantly from those in the eu and the us and approval of the medical device in the country of origin is required before beginning the registration process compliance with us fda quality system requirements andor iso 13485 will satisfy cfda quality management system requirements cfda has approved our submission for invisalign 

  

other government oversight 

we are also subject to various laws inside and outside the us concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products as a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federally funded programs such as medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties for example the us federal physician payment sunshine act went into effect in 2014 which requires public transparency of transfers of value to physicians 

we are also subject to numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us to multinational requirements in the eu in the us final regulations implementing amendments to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the hipaa omnibus rule the eu is currently considering a proposal to enact legislation governing data protection which would transform the current mix of european countries’ laws to one overarching multinational law meanwhile the asia pacific region has also seen rapid development of privacy laws including in singapore hong kong and australia we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 3580 employees including 2320 in manufacturing and operations 730 in sales and marketing which includes customer care 260 in research and development and 270 in general and administrative functions

 item 1a risk factors 

we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our net revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign treatment for any reason a continued weakness in general economic conditions or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

we expect that net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily invisalign full and invisalign teen will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the us economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners in addition invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for the treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that the invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products 

the frequency of use of the invisalign system by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of the invisalign system by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues 

we provide volume based discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs in the future or participation in these programs increases if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling prices would be adversely affected and our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced furthermore although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity at our existing facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including excess or constrained capacity and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects 

  because we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results 

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our net revenues while controlling our expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

 16 

 

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to 

 

if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and produce enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with invisalign since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products to our customers if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and operating profits could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in san jose costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our san jose california facility we also carry out research and development at locations in moscow russia in addition our customercare accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in san jose costa rica we also have operations in israel where the design and wand assembly and our intraoral scanner are manufactured our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

 18 

 

if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations as a result of these sales operations we face a variety of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the timeframe our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both locations in costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our headquarters facility in california is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences we are in the process of implementing a multiyear companywide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning erp software system to perform various functions the implementation of additional functionality in the erp system entails certain risks including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt our operations such as our ability to track orders and timely ship products manage our supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data during transitions we must continue to rely on legacy information systems which may be costly or inefficient while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert managements attention from other operational activities negatively affect employee morale or have other unintended consequences additionally if we are not able to accurately forecast expenses and capitalized costs related to the project this may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties which we depend upon may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the clincheck and myaligntech software software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

competition in the markets for our products is intense and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us many of these manufacturers including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive the expiration of certain key patents commencing in 2017 owned by us may result in additional competition large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues volume growth net income and stock price we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2014  we had issued 352 us patents 97 pending us patent applications and 257 foreign issued patents and 108 pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable 

circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the existing policies or procedures may become ineffective establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed in addition our ability to recognize revenue on the direct sales of our intraoral scanners depends in part upon our ability to schedule and staff trainings the loss of the services provided by these individuals or our ability to timely hire such personnel in sufficient numbers based on our volume growth may harm our business if we are unable to retain our trainers or replace such individuals with persons having equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise in newly hired personnel or accurately predict the number of such personnel needed our net revenues could be materially harmed   

  

  if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 

from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing the vast majority of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 

we rely on a third party manufacturer in israel to assemble our itero scanner as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets as of december 31 2014  our north american sales organization consisted of approximately 280 people internationally we had approximately 160 people engaged in direct sales and sales support as of december 31 2014  we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish and maintain strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed 

if our distributor relationships are not successful our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected 

we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in various geographic regions and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons including 

 complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

in addition as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify and discourage the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals additional reporting obligations are being considered by the european union the implementation of the existing us requirements and any additional requirements in europe could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our products for example the implementation of these disclosure requirements may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our material sourcing is broad based and multitiered and we may be unable to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products we may suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these disclosure requirements including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years congress passed health care reform legislation that president obama signed into law in march 2010 this legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers effective january 1 2013 as a medical device manufacturer we were required to pay an excise tax on the price for which we sell our medical devices in the us this medical device excise tax mdet applies to most medical devices including our products which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 

during march 2014 align had extensive discussions with the irs and they informed us that our aligners are not subject to the mdet however our scanners are still subject to the mdet as a result of these discussions beginning in march 2014 we ceased expensing and paying the mdet for aligners which reduced our general and administrative expense for the year ended december 31 2014  by approximately 68 million compared to the prior year period the excise tax expense was 71 million for the year ended december 31 2013 however mdet for year ended december 31 2014  was reduced to 03 million due to the changes noted above additionally we are in process of claiming a 68 million refund of mdet paid in 2013 related to our aligners however because this claim is subject to review and approval by the irs we have not recorded a receivable as the outcome of the audit is undeterminable any future changes in the applicability of the mdet as it applies to us or refunds of amounts previously paid will be recorded as an additional expense or a credit to the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which it becomes probable and reasonably estimable the mdet is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

outside of north america we currently sell our products in europe asia pacific latin america and the middle east and may expand into other countries from time to time for sales of our products outside the us we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless 

of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we review our goodwill and asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

 if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in a current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

we have adopted a shareholders rights’ plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders to date our board has designated 200000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of align or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights’ plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates nondeductible goodwill impairments changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the 

various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans settlement of income tax audits and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 

in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of various income tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 under these incentives all of the income in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax in order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2014 as a result of these incentives our income taxes were reduced by 325 million and 277 million for the year ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 040 and 034 in 2014 and 2013 respectively income taxes were reduced by 97 million in both the three months ended december 31 2014 and 2013 representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 012 in each period our subsidiary in israel is under audit by the local tax authorities for calendar years 2006 through 2012

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

align technology inc is a global medical device company that advanced the invisible orthodontics market with the introduction of the invisalign system in 1999 today we are focused on designing manufacturing and marketing innovative technologyrich products to help dental professionals achieve the clinical results they expect and deliver effective convenient cuttingedge dental treatment options to their patients align technology was founded in march 1997 and is headquartered in san jose california with offices worldwide our international headquarters are located in amsterdam the netherlands we have two operating segments 1 clear aligner known as the invisalign system and 2 scanner and services scanner known as the itero intraoral scanners and orthocad services which we previously referred to as scanner and cadcam services sccs 

we received fda clearance in 1998 and began our first commercial sales of invisalign to us orthodontists in 1999 followed by us general practitioner dentists gps in 2002 over the next decade we introduced invisalign to the european market and japan added distribution partners in asia pacific latin america and europe middle east and africa emea and introduced a full range of treatment options including invisalign express 10 invisalign teen invisalign assist and vivera retainers by 2011 we launched significant new aligner and software features across all invisalign products that make it easier for doctors to use invisalign on more complex cases and introduced invisalign to the people’s republic of china in 2013 we launched smarttrack the next generation of invisalign clear aligner material which became the new standard aligner material for invisalign products in north america europe and other international markets where we have obtained regulatory approval over the last several years’ we have continued to build upon our technology and expertise to deliver enhanced clinical innovations aimed at helping our customers treat some of the most challenging cases these innovations both launched in early 2014 include invisalign g5 specifically designed for treatment of deep bite malocclusion as well as clincheck pro the next generation invisalign treatment software tool designed to help invisalign providers achieve their treatment goals most recently in november 2014 we announced the upcoming release of invisalign g6 clinical innovations for first premolar extraction 

we also sell itero intraoral scanners and provide computeraided design and computeraided manufacturing cadcam services intraoral scanners provide a dental “chairside” platform for accessing valuable digital diagnosis and treatment tools with potential for enhancing accuracy of records treatment efficiency and the overall patient experience we believe there are numerous benefits for customers and the opportunity to accelerate the adoption of invisalign through interoperability with our intraoral scanners the use of digital technologies such as cadcam for restorative dentistry or inoffice restorations has been growing rapidly and intraoral scanning is a critical part of enabling these new digital technologies and procedures in dental practices in late 2012 we commercially launched the invisalign outcome simulator the first invisalign chairside application powered by the itero scanner the interactive application provides dentists and orthodontists an enhanced platform for patient education and is designed to increase treatment acceptance by helping patients visualize the benefits possible with invisalign treatment in january 2014 we announced that the 3m™ true definition scanner was qualified for use with invisalign case submissions this qualification enables invisalign providers with a true definition scanner to submit a digital impression in place of a traditional pvs impression as part of the invisalign case submission process the 3m true definition scanner is currently the only thirdparty scanner that has been qualified for use with invisalign treatment we continue to believe in an open systems approach to digital impressions and are committed to working with other intraoral scanning companies interested in developing interoperability for use with invisalign treatment 

the invisalign system is offered in more than 80 countries and has been used to treat more than 30 million patients our itero intraoral scanner which is primarily sold in north america provides dental professionals with an open choice to send digital impressions to any laboratorybased cadcam system or to any of the more than 2400 dental labs worldwide 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning device for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers set forth in the  business strategy  section in our annual report on form 10k 

the successful execution of our business strategy and our results in 2014 and beyond may be affected by a number of other factors which are updated below 

 

 invisalign utilization rates   of cases shipped divided by  of doctors cases were shipped to 

total utilization in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 44 cases per doctor which is flat when compared to the third quarter of 2014 however in the fourth quarter of 2013 utilization rates increased for our international doctors which was offset by a decrease in utilization by our north american orthodontic doctors the decrease by our north american orthodontic doctors reflects a seasonal decline in the number of teenaged cases shipped as summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year on a yearoveryear basis total utilization of 44 cases per doctor in the fourth quarter of 2014 remained flat compared to the 

fourth quarter of 2013 we expect that over the longterm our utilization rates will gradually improve as a result of advancements in product and technology which continue to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign along with the implementation of our gotomarket strategy as discussed below however we expect that our utilization rates may fluctuate from period to period 

 

 we believe that these investments will position us to increase our revenue and continue to grow our market share

us dollar if the us dollar continues to strengthen compared to other foreign currencies including the euro our reported amount of net revenues and income will be negatively impacted compared to the same period last year 

 

results of operations 

net revenues by reportable segment comparison for year ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

we group our operations into two reportable segments clear aligner segment and scanner and services segment 

    net revenues for our clear aligner segment by region and product and our scanner segment by region for the year ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  is as follows in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

 

clear aligner case volume by channel and product 

case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by region and product for the year ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  as follows in millions 



           changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

fiscal year 2014  compared to fiscal year 2013   

total net revenues increased by 1014 million  in 2014  as compared to 2013  primarily as a result of invisalign case volume growth across all regions and products as well as increased invisalign noncase revenue 

clear aligner 

clear aligner north america net revenues increased by 384 million  or 94  in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to invisalign case volume growth of approximately 321 million across all channels and products and to a lesser extent higher average selling prices asp which contributed approximately 63 million to the increase in net revenues the increase in asp was primarily a result of increased midcourse correction revenue from higher usage as well as a product mix shift towards higher priced invisalign products in 2014 compared to 2013 this increase was offset in part by higher promotional discounts in 2014 as compared to 2013 

clear aligner international net revenues increased by 580 million  or 359  in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily driven by invisalign case volume growth of 462 million along with higher asp which contributed approximately 118 million to the increase in net revenues the increase in asp was primarily due to the impact from acquiring our distributor in the asia pacific region on april 30 2013 when we began recognizing direct sales of invisalign products sold in that region at our full asp rather than the discounted asp under the distributor agreement as well as the price increases which were effective july 2013 along with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact to revenues in 2014 as compared to 2013 despite the weakening of the euro to the us dollar in the last six months of 2014 

invisalign noncase net revenues consisting of training fees and ancillary product revenues increased by 15 million  in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the consolidation of our vivera product shipments in north america from four shipments per year to one shipment along with increased vivera volume both in north america and international 

scanner and services 

scanner and services net revenues increased by 35 million  or 77  in 2014 compared to 2013 due to an increase in both services revenue as well as scanner revenue 

the increase in services revenue was primarily due to an increase in the volume of cadcam services resulting from a larger installed base of scanners the increase in scanner revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of scanners recognized offset in part by lower scanner asp as a result of promotional discounts as well as permanent price reductions the increase was partially offset as 2013 had higher net revenues due to the release of 14 million of revenue previously reserved for the itero upgrade program which was completed in the first quarter of 2013 

fiscal year 2013  compared to fiscal year 2012   

total net revenues increased by 1002 million in 2013  as compared to 2012  primarily as a result of invisalign case volume growth across all regions and products as well as increased invisalign noncase revenue 

clear aligner 

clear aligner north america net revenues increased by 471 million or 130 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to invisalign case volume growth of approximately 485 million across all channels and products offset in part by lower average selling prices asp which decreased net revenues by approximately 14 million the decrease in asp was a result of product mix shift towards lower priced invisalign express products combined with the revenue deferral for free midcourse correction as a result of our policy change in june 2013 beginning june 15 2013 we included up to three free midcourse correction orders in our list prices for invisalign full and invisalign teen 

clear aligner international net revenues increased by 369 million or 296 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily driven by invisalign case volume growth of 311 million along with higher asp which resulted in approximately 58 million increase in net revenues the increase in asp was primarily due to the impact from acquiring our distributor in the apac region on april 30 2013 as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates by bringing the apac region direct we began to recognize 

direct sales of invisalign products sold in that region at our full asp rather than the discounted asp under the distributor agreement the increase in asp was offset in part due to a product mix shift towards lower priced invisalign lite products 

invisalign noncase net revenues consisting of training fees and ancillary product revenues increased by 140 million or 456 in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to the consolidation of our vivera product shipments in north america from four shipments per year to one shipment along with increased vivera volume both in north america and international 

scanner and services 

scanner and services net revenues increased by 22 million or 51 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in scanner revenues partially offset by a decrease in cadcam services net revenues as a result of the discontinuation of the orthocad iq services during the fourth quarter of 2012 the increase in scanner revenues in 2013 was as a result of the increase in number of scanners sales recognized in 2013 as compared to 2012 as well as the release of 14 million of revenue previously reserved for the new itero upgrade program which was completed in the first quarter of 2013 

cost of net revenues and gross profit in millions 

  



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

cost of net revenues for our clear aligner and scanner segments includes salaries for staff involved in the production process the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process amortization of acquired intangible assets from cadent training costs and stockbased compensation 

fiscal year 2014  compared to fiscal year 2013   

clear aligner 

the gross margin percentage improved slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 due to higher asp the asp improvement was mostly offset by increased manufacturing costs in 2014 when compared to 2013 which benefited from an out of period adjustment see note 1 in the financial statements 

scanner 

the gross margin percentage increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to increased absorption of manufacturing spend from higher production volumes lower product costs due to product mix and lower inventory reserves these were partially offset by a lower asp as a result of price reductions 

fiscal year 2013  compared to fiscal year 2012   

clear aligner 

the gross margin percentage improved slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower warranty costs as a result of reduced warranty claims corresponding with the change in our midcourse correction policy in june 2013 in addition gross margins benefited to a lessor extent from an out of period adjustment see note 1 in the financial statements which was partially offset by increased material costs primarily related to our new smarttrack material in addition we incurred higher inventory reserves for our prior aligner material which has been substantially replaced by our new smarttrack aligner material 

scanner 

the gross margin percentage increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of the release of revenue for amounts previously reserved in 2012 for the new 29 itero scanner upgrade program which was completed in the first quarter of 2013 in addition we had lower manufacturing costs as a result of the closure of our new jersey facility which was completed by october 2012 and a reduction in training costs however these savings were partially offset by higher third party labor service costs and lower manufacturing cost absorption 

sales and marketing in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

sales and marketing expense includes sales force and marketing compensation including travelrelated costs media and advertising clinical education trade shows and industry events product marketing stockbased compensation and allocations of corporate overhead expenses including facilities and it 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily   due to higher compensation costs of 194 million due to increased headcount including the additional headcount from the acquisition of our apac distributor in addition we incurred higher advertising and marketing expenses as a result of increased advertising production and marketing campaigns combined with higher costs for trade shows and our europe and apac summits 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to higher compensation costs of 164 million largely related to increased headcount including additional employees as a result of the acquisition of our apac distributor higher sales commissions and stockbased compensation in addition we incurred higher advertising and media costs primarily related to network and television media campaigns 

general and administrative in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

general and administrative expense primarily includes administrative personnel compensation costs including stockbased compensation outside consulting services legal expenses depreciation and amortization expense the medical device excise tax mdet effective january 2013 and allocations of corporate overhead expenses including facilities and it 

general and administrative expense for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily due to higher stockbased compensation of 47 million as well as increases in consulting expenses and credit card processing fees however these increases were offset 

by lower mdet of 68 million as our aligners are no longer subject to the excise tax in 2014 as well as lower outside litigation costs as previously noted in march 2014 the irs informed us that our aligners are not subject to the mdet which we had been paying and expensing in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations since january 1 2013 however our scanners are still subject to the mdet but are not material there is no expense in the current year period for mdet related to our aligners additionally we are in process of claiming a 68 million refund of mdet paid in 2013 related to our aligners however because this claim is subject to review and approval by the irs we have not recorded a receivable as the outcome of the audit is uncertain any future changes in the applicability of the mdet as it applies to us or refunds of amounts previously paid will be recorded as an additional expense or a credit to the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which is becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

general and administrative expense for 2013 increased compared to 2012 primarily due to higher compensation related costs of 76 million as a result of higher stockbased compensation expense and increased salaries additionally we incurred 71 million of medical device excise tax as a result of new tax regulations effective january 1 2013 these costs were partially offset by lower outside legal expenses 

research and development in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

research and development expense includes the personnelrelated costs and outside consulting expenses associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products corporate allocations facility and facility related costs and stockbased compensation expense

impairment of goodwill in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

there was no impairment of goodwill charge recorded in the year ended december 31 2014 

during the first quarter of 2013 we determined that the goodwill for our scanner and services reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests due to changes in the competitive environment for intraoral scanners which included announcements of new lowpriced scanners targeted at orthodontist and gp dentist in north america as a result this caused us to lower our expectations for growth and profitability for our scanner and services reporting unit that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our scanner and services reporting unit below its carrying amount as a result of our analysis we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 407 million in the first quarter of 2013 none of which was deductible for tax purposes refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

during the third quarter of 2012 we determined that the goodwill for our scanner and services reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests since an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our scanner and services reporting unit below its carrying amount as a result of our analysis we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of 2012 of 247 million  and an additional 119 million  during 

the fourth quarter of 2012 representing a change in estimate upon finalizing our 2013 annual budget process for a total impairment charge of 366 million  none of the goodwill impairment charge was deductible for tax purposes and there was no additional impairment that resulted from our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

impairment of longlived assets in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

there was no impairment of longlived assets charge recorded in the year ended december 31 2014 

the impairment of our longlived assets in 2013 was the result of changes in the competitive environment for intraoral scanners which included announcements of new lowpriced scanners targeted at orthodontist and gp dentist in north america that caused us to lower our expectations for growth and profitability for our scanner and services reporting unit as a result we determined that the carrying value of the longlived assets was not recoverable and therefore recorded an impairment charge of 263 million refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

interest and other income expense net in millions 



interest and other income expense net includes foreign currency translation gains and losses interest income earned on cash cash equivalents and investment balances and other miscellaneous charges 

interest and other income expense net in 2014 decreased due to higher foreign exchange losses primarily as a result of the weakening of the euro to the us dollar offset slightly by increased interest income earned on higher balances of cash cash equivalents and investments 

interest and other income expense net in 2013 increased slightly due to increased interest income earned on higher balances of cash cash equivalents and investments offset slightly by higher foreign exchange losses 

provision for income taxes in millions 



changes and percentages are based on actual values certain tables may not sum or recalculate due to rounding 

our provision for income taxes was 445 million 288 million and 256 million for the year ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively this represents effective tax rates of 234 310 and 304 respectively our effective tax rates in these fiscal years differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to certain foreign earnings primarily from costa rica which are subject to a lower tax rate partially offset by higher state income tax expense the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation charges and unrecognized tax benefits our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2014 also reflects a negative impact from a 18 million adjustment related to prior years which was recorded during the three months ended june 30 2014 the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 and 2012 also reflects a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge of 407 million and 366 million respectively 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 2609 million of undistributed earnings from nonus operations held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us accordingly no additional us income taxes or 

additional foreign withholding taxes have been provided thereon we have sufficient cash reserves in the us and do not intend to repatriate our foreign earnings we intend to use the undistributed earnings for local operating expansions and to meet local operating working capital needs if these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets quarterly should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we do not expect to realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realizable the available positive evidence at december 31 2014 included historical operating profits a projection of future income and other objectively verifiable evidence as of december 31 2014 we believed except for the items noted in the subsequent paragraph that is was more likely than not that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet will be realized 

as of december 31 2014 we had a valuation allowance of 325 million against our deferred tax assets which primarily relates to foreign net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards the valuation allowance decreased from december 31 2013 by 26 million due to 18 million related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards and 08 million related to the release of the valuation allowance related to japan and china deferred tax assets 

  

at december 31 2014 we have california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 373 million which if not used will begin to expire in 2015 these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code §382 but are expected to be fully realized at december 31 2014 we had california research credit carryforwards of approximately 38 million that can be carried forward indefinitely 

we account for uncertain tax positions pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we first determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon audit based on its technical merits if a tax position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information to the extent the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

during fiscal year 2014 the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by 64 million the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was 331 million as of december 31 2014 all of which would impact our effective tax rate if recognized we have elected to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense the penalties and interest accrued as of december 31 2014 and 2013 are immaterial we do not expect any significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 

during the first quarter of 2014 we adopted asu 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force the adoption of this standard had the effect of reducing our accruals for uncertain tax positions by 84 million with an offsetting reduction in our long term deferred tax assets but had no effect on net income 

we file us federal us state and nonus tax returns our major tax jurisdictions are us federal and the state of california for us federal and state tax returns we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years before 2000 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to examination by foreign tax authorities for years before 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales and the proceeds from the sale of our common stock as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had the following cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in thousands 



cash flows  in thousands 



as of december 31 2014  we had 6026 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm marketable securities cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments which primarily include commercial paper corporate bonds us dollar denominated foreign corporate bonds us government agency bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities 

as of december 31 2014  approximately 3382   million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the us the costs to repatriate our foreign earnings to the us would likely be material however our intent is to permanently reinvest our earnings from foreign operations and our current plans do not require us to repatriate them to fund our us operations as we generate sufficient domestic operating cash flow and have access to external funding under our current revolving line of credit 

on april 23 2014 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may purchase up to 3000 million of our common stock over the next three years with 1000 million of that amount authorized to be purchased over the next twelve months any purchases under this stock repurchase program may be made from timetotime pursuant to open market purchases including pursuant to rule 10b51 plans privatelynegotiated transactions accelerated stock repurchases block trades or derivative contracts or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws including rule 10b18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as part of this repurchase program on april 28 2014 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement asr with goldman sachs  co to repurchase 700 million of our common stock under the terms of the asr we agreed to repurchase in total 700 million of our common stock and received an initial delivery of approximately 10 million shares based on the then current market price which were retired the asr was completed on july 29 2014 with a final delivery of approximately 04 million shares we received a total of 14 million shares under the asr for an average purchase price per share of 5146 the final number of shares repurchased was based on our volumeweighted average stock price during the term of the transaction less an agreed upon discount in addition during 2014 we repurchased on the open market approximately 06 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 5093 per share including commissions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 282 million all repurchased shares were retired as of december 31 2014 we have 2018 million remaining under the april 2014 stock repurchase program 18 million of which we expect to purchase over the next three months in addition in january 2015 our board of directors has authorized the next 1000 million under the program to be repurchased which we anticipate completing within twelve months we expect to finance future stock repurchases with current cash on hand 

on march 22 2013 we entered into a credit facility with wells fargo bank the credit facility provides for a 500 million revolving line of credit with a 100 million letter of credit sublimit and has a maturity date on march 22 2016 the credit facility also requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of 500 million and comply with specific financial conditions and performance requirements the loan bears interest at our option at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the daily onemonth adjusted libor rate plus a spread of 175 or an adjusted libor rate based on one three six or twelvemonth interest periods plus a spread of 175 as of december 31 2014 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with the conditions and performance requirements 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities combined with our positive cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and stock repurchases for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to suspend our stock repurchase program or seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

for 2015 we expect to invest 700 million to 800 million on capital expenditures primarily for additional manufacturing capacity and infrastructure including a project to implement a new enterprise resource planning system which we started in late 2014 with expected golive for various modules and subsidiaries throughout 2016 although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 

net cash used in investing activities was 2107  million for the year ended december 31 2013  primarily consisted of our purchase of marketable securities of 3039 million  and property and equipment purchases of 194 million  along with 77 million for the acquisition of our asia pacific distributor in april 2013 these uses were partially offset by 1227 million of maturities and sales of our marketable securities 

net cash used in investing activities was 783  million for the year ended december 31 2012  primarily consisted of our purchase of marketable securities of 675 million and property and equipment purchases of 383 million these costs were partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of 252 million and the release of 25 million of funds related to unclaimed merger consideration for the acquisition of cadent on april 29 2011 included in other investing activities 

financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities was 664  million for the year ended december 31 2014  resulting from repurchases of our common stock of 982 million  and 76 million  of payroll taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units 

through share withholdings partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of 180 million  and 214 million  from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements 

net cash used by financing activities was 382 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  resulting from repurchases of our common stock of 951 million  and 44 million  of payroll taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units through share withholdings partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of 342 million and 271 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements 

net cash provided by financing activities was 102 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  resulting from approximately 423 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately 172 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements these proceeds were partially offset by approximately 472 million common stock repurchases and 21 million of payroll taxes paid for our employees’ vesting of restricted stock units through share withholdings 

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting restricted stock units “rsus” which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercises as a result we will continue to generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods in addition because restricted stock units are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our employees will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2014  2013  and 2012  we paid 76  million 44  million and 21  million respectively for taxes related to restricted stock units that vested during the periods 

stock repurchase 

on october 27 2011 we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 1500 million  of common stock purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market 

during 2012 we repurchased approximately 17 million  shares of common stock at an average price of 2728  per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 472 million including commissions the common stock repurchases reduced additional paidin capital by approximately 154 million  and increased accumulated deficit by 318 million  during 2013 we repurchased approximately 27  million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3495  per share including commissions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 951 million  the common stock repurchases reduced additional paidin capital by approximately 245 million  and increased accumulated deficit by 706 million  all repurchased shares were retired the october 2011 program was complete as of december 31 2013 

on april 23 2014 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may purchase up to 3000 million of our common stock over the next three years with 1000 million of that amount authorized to be purchased over the first twelve months any purchases under this stock repurchase program may be made from timetotime pursuant to open market purchases including pursuant to rule 10b51 plans privatelynegotiated transactions accelerated stock repurchases block trades or derivative contracts or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws including rule 10b18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 

as part of our 3000 million stock repurchase program we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement asr with goldman sachs  co on april 28 2014 to repurchase 700 million of our common stock we paid 700 million on april 29 2014 and received an initial delivery of approximately 10 million shares the asr was completed on july 29 2014 with a final delivery of approximately 04 million shares we received a total of approximately 14 million shares under the asr for an average purchase price per share of 5146 which all shares were retired the final number of shares repurchased was based on our volumeweighted average stock price during the term of the transaction less an agreed upon discount 

during 2014 we repurchased on the open market approximately 06 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 5093 per share including commissions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 282 million all repurchased shares were retired as of december 31 2014 we have 2018 million remaining under the april 2014 stock repurchase program of which 18 million was repurchased in january 2015 in addition in january 2015 our board of directors has authorized the next 1000 million under the program to be repurchased which we anticipate completing within twelve months we expect to finance future stock repurchases with current cash on hand 

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 



our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 331 million of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2014  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2014  

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities combined with our positive cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

indemnification provisions 

in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify customers vendors lessors and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 

it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period as of december 31 2014  we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we measure and allocate revenue according to the accounting guidance for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements in accounting standards update “asu” 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangementsa consensus of the financial accounting standard board “fasb” emerging issues task force  

multipleelement arrangements “meas”  arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including any combination of productsequipment and services the deliverables included in the meas are separated into more than one unit of accounting when i the delivered productequipment has value to the customer on a standalone basis and ii delivery of the undelivered service elements is probable and substantially in our control arrangement consideration is then allocated to each unit delivered or undelivered based on the relative selling price “rsp” of each unit of accounting based first on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists second on thirdparty evidence “tpe” if it exists and on best estimated selling price “besp” if neither vsoe or tpe exist   

 

provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

clear aligner 

we enter into arrangements “treatment plans” that involve multiple future product deliverables invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist products include up to three optional case refinements case refinement is a finishing tool used to adjust a patients teeth to the desired final position case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment beginning june 15 2013 invisalign full and invisalign teen products also include up to three optional midcourse corrections midcourse correction is a treatment adjustment during active treatment if the case is not tracking to the original treatment plan or goals midcourse correction gives doctors the ability to adjust course based on the needs of the individual patient invisalign teen also includes up to six optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered any time throughout treatment 

we determined that our treatment plans except invisalign assist with progress tracking comprise the following deliverables which also represent separate units of accounting singlebatched aligners case refinement midcourse correction and replacement aligners we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each units relative selling price based on besp and recognize the revenue upon the delivery of each unit in the treatment plan we regularly review our estimates of selling price and maintain internal controls over the establishment and update of these estimates 

for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature aligners and services are provided to the dental professional every nine stages “a batch” beginning january 1 2011 we were able to reliably estimate the number of batches which are expected to be shipped for each case based upon our historical experience the amounts allocated to this deliverable are recognized on a prorated basis as each batch is shipped 

prior to 2013 the vivera retainer included four shipments per year and revenue was recognized ratably as each shipment occurred in the first quarter of 2013 we consolidated vivera retainer product shipments down to one shipment per year 

scanners and services 

we recognize revenues from the sales of itero intraoral scanners and cadcam services cadcam services include scanning services extended warranty for the intraoral scanners a range of itero restorative services and orthocad services such as orthocad irecord we sell intraoral scanners and services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and for additional fees the customer may select an unlimited scanning service agreement over a fixed period of time or extended warranty periods revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured title and risk of loss has passed to customers based on the shipping terms no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts returns and customer incentives can be reliably estimated when intraoral scanners are sold with either an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenue based on each elements relative selling price we estimate the selling price of each element as if it is sold on a standalone basis taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies scanner revenue net of related discounts and allowances is recognized when products or equipment have been shipped installed and onsite training completed for certain distributors who provide installation and training to the customer we recognize scanner revenue when the intraoral scanner is shipped to the distributor assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

discounts are deducted from revenue at the time of sale or when the discount is offered whichever is later and free cases or training is included as a deliverable in the multipleelement arrangement assessment returns of products excluding warranty related returns are infrequent and insignificant 

service revenue including itero restorative and all orthocad services are recognized upon delivery or ratably over the contract term as the specified services are performed if a customer selects a pay per use basis for scanning service fees the revenue is recognized as the service is provided 

we offer customers an option to purchase extended warranties on certain products we recognize revenue on these extended warranty contracts ratably over the life of the contract the costs associated with these extended warranty contracts are recognized when incurred 

  stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award we use the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares we estimate the fair value of marketperformance based restricted stock units using a monte carlo simulation model which requires the input of assumptions including expected term stock price volatility and the riskfree rate of return in addition judgment is required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the reporting units based on relative synergies generated 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of acquisitions and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

impairment of goodwill finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present an event occurs or circumstances changes that suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair 

value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 

we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in performing the qualitative assessment we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors events and circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as our actual and planned financial performance we also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed if after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment no further testing is performed however if we conclude otherwise the first step of the twostep impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value including goodwill 

step one of the goodwill impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the income approach of the reporting units as well as various price or market multiples applied to the reporting units operating results along with the appropriate control premium under the marketing approach both of which are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in note 2 in our consolidated financial statements if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 

during march 2013 changes in the competitive environment for intraoral scanners including announcements from our competitors of new lowpriced scanners targeted at orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in north america caused us to lower our expectations for growth and profitability for our scanner and services reporting unit the impairment analysis performed for goodwill requires several estimates in computing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit utilizing harvest model which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of this business and is most consistent with the approach a market place participant would use as a result we determined that goodwill related only to our scanner and services reporting unit should be tested for impairment as of march 31 2013 due to these facts and circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our scanner and services reporting unit below its carrying amount based on our analysis there was no implied goodwill for the scanner and services reporting unit therefore we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 407 million in the three months ended march 31 2013 which represented the entire goodwill balance in the scanner and services reporting unit there was no triggering event related to the clear aligner goodwill refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

 the remaining goodwill is entirely attributable to our clear aligner reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing using the qualitative approach discussed above and found no impairment as the fair value of our clear aligner reporting unit was significantly in excess of the carrying value 

finitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our longlived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment in 2013 we used a dcf approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit utilizing harvest model which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of a business and is most consistent with the approach of a marketplace participant would use the estimation of fair value utilizing a dcf approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions and the structure that would yield the highest economic value among other factors key assumptions used in measuring the fair values of scanner and services reporting unit included the discount rate based on the weightedaverage cost of capital and revenue growth the fair value of scanner and services trademark was determined using a riskadjusted dcf model under the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used was based on a consideration of market rates the fair value of scanner and services finitelived customer 

relationships was determined using a dcf model under the multiperiod excess earnings method we recorded a longlived asset impairment in the quarter ended march 31 2013 due to changes in the competitive environment for our intraoral scanners including announcements from our competitors of new lowpriced scanners targeted at orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in north america there was no triggering event related to the clear aligner asset group refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realized the available positive evidence at december 31 2014  included historical operating profits and a projection of future income sufficient to realize most of our remaining deferred tax assets as of december 31 2014  it was considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain foreign loss carryovers as we are unable to forecast sufficient future profits to realize the deferred tax assets 

accounting guidance for stockbased compensation prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled 14 million as of december 31 2014 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable we follow the tax law ordering method to determine when excess tax benefits have been realized and consider only the direct impacts of awards when calculating the amount of windfalls or shortfalls 

as of december 31 2014  us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided for on a cumulative total of 2609 million  we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 4027 million  invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2014  and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

we operate in north america europe asia pacific costa rica and israel as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

our company 

align technology inc “we” “our” “align” designs manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy intraoral scanners and cadcam computeraided design and computeraided manufacturing digital services used in dentistry orthodontics and dental records storage align technology was founded in march 1997 and incorporated in delaware in april 1997 our headquarters are located at 2560 orchard parkway san jose california 95131 and our telephone number is 4084701000 our internet address is wwwaligntechcom our international headquarters are located in amsterdam the netherlands 

we have two operating segments 1 clear aligner known as the invisalign system and 2 scanners and cadcam services sccs known as the itero intraoral scanner and orthocad services for the year ended december 31 2013  clear aligner revenues represent approximately 93 percent of worldwide revenue while scanners and cadcam services represent the remaining 7 percent of worldwide revenues we distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers orthodontists and general practitioner dentists gps as well as to restorative dentists including prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons 

we received 510k clearance from the united states food and drug administration “fda” to market the invisalign system in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device in order to provide invisalign treatment to their patients orthodontists and gps must initially complete an invisalign training course the invisalign system is primarily sold through a direct sales force in the united states us canada europe and certain asiapacific countries including australia new zealand china and japan we use a distributor model for the sale of our products in noncore country markets in the asia pacific europe the middle east and africa emea and latin america regions

clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting nearly a billion people or approximately 50 to 75 of the population of major developed countries approximately 68 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 26 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign treatment  our served market 

in the us orthodontists and gps treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices as needed available options for improving treatment aesthetics include the use of ceramic toothcolored brackets or bonding brackets on the inside or lingual 

surface of the patient’s teeth the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement known in the industry as “chair time” including the initial diagnosis creation of an appropriate treatment plan and bonding of the brackets to the patient’s teeth and attachment of arch wires to the brackets subsequent visits involve tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks until the final visit when the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient’s teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable orthodontic aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  the dental professional prepares and sends us a patient’s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition the dental professional can also submit an intraoral scan or “digital impression” instead of a physical pvs impression through either itero or 3m true definition currently the only other invisalign qualified intraoral scanner 

preparation of 3d computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data package to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition in cases where a pvs impression has been submitted we use computed tomography known as ct scanning to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition in cases where the dental professional submits a digital impression this step in the process is eliminated 

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck software  we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan the clincheck plan simulates appropriate tooth movement broken down into a series of twoweek increments and details timing and placement of any attachments that will be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan clincheck pro is the next generation invisalign treatment software tool designed to provide more precise control over final tooth position and to help invisalign providers achieve their treatment goals this latest software innovation features interactive 3d controls that for the first time allow invisalign providers to make adjustments to the position of individual teeth directly on the 3d model and to visualize the effects on the whole dentition in real time 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment  upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional  from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck animation aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment plan after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and resulting clincheck treatment plan 

retention  upon completion of the treatment the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product

although advancements have been made in materials used for taking dental impressions since their introduction one hundred years ago the overall impression process has remained relatively unchanged shortcomings such as voids pulls and the general margin for error have remained inherent in conventional impressions and subsequent retakes create unnecessary costs for a clinical practice intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of the patient’s teeth using a handheld intraoral 

scanner inside the mouth intraoral scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the mess discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions the digital model created with an intraoral scanner is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration “remakes” so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction 

as the only intraoral scanner in the market based on parallel confocal imaging the itero intraoral scanner utilizes laser and optical scanning to capture the contours of the patient’s dentition gingival structures and the bite itero captures 100000 points of laser light in perfect focus without the use of powder to coat the teeth allowing for contact of the wand and tooth the benefit of contact scanning for the clinician is that it eliminates the challenge of hovering over the teeth at a specific distance which can be complicated for the patient they enjoy a more comfortable powder free experience which allows the clinician to provide a very comfortable patient centric experience within minutes an accurate 3d digital impression can be viewed on the screen the 3d digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments invisalign digital impression submission digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis and orthodontic retainers and appliances 

the itero intraoral scanner consists of a mobile computer unit display screen control foot pedal and wand to scan and capture a patient’s dentition full or partial dental arch itero software features include occlusal map eraser tool edge trim tool realtime modeling and an option to submit scans for invisalign treatment itero provides doctors and labs with an open choice to export generic digital files of their digital impression to use with other third party dental service providers this allows the digital impression to integrate with cone beam ct images for implant and orthodontic treatment planning inoffice training on the system and features is provided after the unit is delivered to the practice

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers market expansion doctor preference and brand strength 

 

in parallel with these investments we also engage in professional marketing clinical support and education initiatives that support doctor practice development and facilitate the continued growth of their practices 

in our itero scanner business we leverage our combined sales and marketing resources to facilitate the adoption and penetration of each product into our doctors’ practices many of our customers recognize that having an itero scanner at chairside improves practice effectiveness for invisalign as evidenced by higher invisalign utilization rates among customers with an itero scanner 

 

 

manufacturing and suppliers 

our manufacturing facilities are located in juarez mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribute and repair our scanners perform our cadcam services and in or yehuda israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand the final assembly of our itero scanner is performed by a third party manufacturer located in israel our invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for itero restorative cases are conducted primarily at our facility located in san jose costa rica information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies 

include complex software algorithms and solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica in addition to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source the need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs see item 1a risk factors — “we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and   operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases” 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused primarily on the invisalign system and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and gps worldwide in north america europe and certain asiapacific country markets we have direct sales and support organizations which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration our direct sales organization in north america is comprised of a team of territory managers and to a lesser extent territory specialists these territory specialists are used to enhance coverage especially with lower volume gp customers 

currently we have two distribution partners that sell the invisalign system in smaller noncore country markets in the emea and latin america regions we evaluate adding distribution partners in other noncore country markets on a casebycase basis or assess modifying our current distribution agreements as our international business grows our emea distribution partner has been covering approximately 80 country markets and continues to make good progress in building a base of invisalign trained doctors in those regions given the significant long term potential this extensive geography represents and the support we can now provide by utilizing our direct coverage model in europe beginning in february 2014 we will transition a small number of those countries into direct sales regions we expect to leverage our existing infrastructure and resources to bring sales coverage and customer support to these countries most of which are adjacent to our directly covered european countries due to the small volume of business from our emea distributor we do not anticipate that this transition will have a material effect on our financial results in the next several years 

for our intraoral scanners we have a small team of direct sales representatives in north america our intraoral scanner sales team leverages leads generated by our invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows in 2014 we expect to have very few scanner sales internationally as we continue to evaluate the most effective sales model in this market 

we market invisalign by communicating the benefits of the invisalign system to dental professionals through our training programs online and traditional mail campaigns trade shows trade journals and print we also promote the benefits of invisalign through our integrated consumer marketing platform which combines traditional print and broadcast media with a balanced mix of public relations event marketing and social media the goal of this platform is to raise awareness of invisalign as the best options for a healthy beautiful smile among adults and teenagers in addition our consumer marketing platform enables us to help prospective patients find a great invisalign treatment practice that can meet their needs for intraoral scanners in addition to leveraging invisalign customer events and industry tradeshows to communicate the benefits of digital scanning to dental professionals we also have training programs educational websites and limited print advertising 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps in 2013  we had approximately 38000 active invisalign providers 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans our research and development expenses were 441 million  429 million  and 372 million  for the year ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms our research and development activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we undertake precommercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2013  we had 313  issued us patents 124  pending us patent applications and 239  foreign issued patents as well as 116  pending foreign patent applications 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends related to our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve for example european sales of invisalign treatment are often weaker in the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our sccs segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the individualized nature of an invisalign treatment which is prescribed by a doctor no two cases are alike and we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which a treatment data package or “a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our invisalign backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future invisalign sales our quarterly invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter we define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where payment is reasonably assured and credit and financing is approved but the scanner has not yet shipped our intraoral scanner backlog as of december 31 2013  was not material 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive market and we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we also face competition from early stage companies although the number of competitors varies by segment currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc and dentsply international inc information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

key competitive factors include 

 

we believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

in order for us to market our products we must obtain regulatory authorization and comply with extensive product and quality system regulations these regulations including the requirements for approvals or clearance and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country failure to obtain regulatory approval and to meet all local requirements including language and specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market or plan to market our products could prevent us from marketing products in such countries or subject us to sanctions and fines the approval by government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain and may not be granted on a timely basis if at all delays in receipt of or a failure to receive such approvals or clearances or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we believe we are in compliance with all fda federal and state laws and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations countryspecific regulatory framework and requirements are highlighted in the following examples 

us 

in the us the medical device amendments of 1976 to the federal food drug and cosmetic act fda act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations provide the fda with authority over medical devices and the research clinical testing manufacture labeling distribution sale and promotion of such devices medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i ii or iii the class to which the device is assigned determines among other things the type of premarketing submissionapplication required for market authorization our invisalign aligners and intraoral scanners are classified as class ii medical devices and we have obtained applicable 510k clearances for our marketed products 

the fda act also requires manufactured devices to comply with applicable quality system regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to design development manufacturing and quality assurance activities including the reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device we are subject to unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities to determine compliance with applicable regulations and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain instances by the federal trade commission the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in among other things warning letters fines injunctions civil penalties recall or seizures of products total or partial suspension of production failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or approval for devices withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution the fda also has the authority to request repair replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 

european union 

the member states of the european union eu have adopted the european medical device directives mdd 9342eec that form a single set of medical device regulations for all eu member countries the mdd defines the quality system safety and performance requirements to be met by manufacturers for their products called the essential requirements certification to iso 13485 an international standard for quality management systems demonstrates compliance with the quality system requirements outlined in the mdd our quality management system is iso 13485 certified by the british standards institute an approved full scope notified body as defined in the regulations 

canada 

in canada the system of approval for medical devices is governed by the medical device regulations of the department of justice sor98282 including quality system requirements based on iso 13485 facility registration and device licensing the scope of our quality management system certification includes the additional requirements defined by health canada 

japan 

in japan the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw regulates medical devices under the pharmaceutical affairs law pal manufacturers with no local presence in japan must appoint a marketing authorization holder mah to manage their device registration process and liaise with the pharmaceutical and medical devices agency pmda japan’s medical device market regulator manufacturers of class ii iii and iv devices must implement a quality system compliant with the pal and mhlw ordinance 169 japan qms regulation and submit qms conformity assessment application the scope of our quality management system certification includes the additional requirements defined by pal and invisalign has been authorized for sale 

china 

in china the china food and drug administration cfda regulates medical devices the device classification process in china differs significantly from those in the eu and the us and approval of the medical device in the country of origin is required before beginning the registration process compliance with us fda quality system requirements andor iso 13485 will satisfy cfda quality management system requirements cfda has approved our submission for invisalign 

  

other government oversight 

we are also subject to various laws inside and outside the us concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials price reporting and regulation the promotion sales and marketing of our products and services the importation and exportation of our products the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products as a global company we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement initiatives sponsored by government agencies legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business it is not possible to predict at this time the longterm impact of such cost containment measures on our future business 

our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federally funded programs such as medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program each of which may offer some degree of oversight many government agencies both domestic and foreign have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent 

years enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties for example the us federal physician payment sunshine act recently went into effect which requires public transparency of transfers of value to physicians 

we are also subject to numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the us to multinational requirements in the eu in the us final regulations implementing amendments to the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the hipaa omnibus rule the eu is currently considering a proposal to enact legislation governing data protection which would transform the current mix of european countries’ laws to one overarching multinational law meanwhile in the asiapacific region has also seen rapid development of privacy laws including in singapore hong kong and australia we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 3420 employees including 2280 in manufacturing and operations 640 in sales and marketing which includes customer care 230 in research and development and 270 in general and administrative functions

 item 1a risk factors 

we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our net revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign treatment for any reason a continued weakness in general economic conditions or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

we expect that net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily invisalign full and invisalign teen will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the us economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results continued weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners in addition invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products 

the frequency of use of the invisalign system by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of the invisalign system by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products which may decrease our net revenues 

in response to challenges in our business including increased competition we have in the past reduced the list price of our products we also provide volume based discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs in the future or participation in these programs increases if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue or if sales by our distributors grows at a faster pace than our direct sales our average selling prices would be adversely affected and our net revenues gross profit gross margin and net income may be reduced furthermore although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our net revenues and net income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and net income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of net revenues and net income in our consolidated financial statements 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to excess or constrained capacity at our existing facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects 

  because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results 

we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions which may have an adverse effect on our business 

we acquired cadent holdings inc in april 2011 for their people their technology and their existing revenue streams such as orthocad irecord and orthocad icast in addition to their intraoral scanning technology this acquisition is expected to strengthen our ability to drive adoption of invisalign treatment by integrating more fully with mainstream tools and procedures in doctors’ practices in addition we believe that the combination of the two companies will help accelerate the use of intraoral scanning in the dental industry by leveraging align’s global sales reach extensive professional and consumer marketing capabilities and large customer base we completed the acquisition of our asia pacific distributor on april 30 2013 

 we may experience difficulties in achieving the anticipated financial or strategic benefits of these acquisitions potential risks include 

 

if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business with our existing business our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our net revenues while controlling our expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

 17 

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to 

 

if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and produce enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with invisalign since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products to our customers if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and operating profits could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will 

increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in san jose costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our san jose california facility we also carry out research and development at locations in san jose costa rica and moscow russia in addition our customercare accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in san jose costa rica we also have operations in israel where the design and wand assembly and our intraoral scanner are manufactured our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

 

if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales and face risks attendant to those operations 

we earn an increasingly larger portion of our total revenues from international sales generated through our foreign direct and indirect operations as a result of these sales operations we face a variety of risks including 

 

 19 

 

 

 

any of these factors either individually or in combination could materially impact our international operations and adversely affect our business as a whole 

a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the timeframe our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net income and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both locations in costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our headquarters facility in california is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the markets for our products is intense and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us many of these manufacturers including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive the expiration of key certain patents commencing in 2017 owned by us may result in additional competition large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues volume growth net income loss and stock price we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

we are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the clincheck and myaligntech software software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2013  we had issued 313  us patents 124  pending us patent applications and 239  foreign issued patents and 116  pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including 

orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed during 2013 and early 2014 we announced the appointment of four executive officers including a new chief financial officer with these new appointments there is the risk of uncertainty and instability relating to transition the duties and responsibilities to new key executives in an orderly effective and efficient manner in addition our ability to recognize revenue on the direct sales of our intraoral scanners depends in part upon our ability to schedule and staff trainings the loss of the services provided by these individuals or our ability to timely hire such personnel in sufficient numbers based on our volume growth may harm our business if we are unable to retain our trainers or replace such individuals with persons having equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise in newly hired personnel or accurately predict the number of such personnel needed our net revenues could be materially harmed   

  

  if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 

we rely on a third party manufacturer in israel to assemble our itero scanner as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets as of december 31 2013  our north american sales organization consisted of approximately 260 people internationally we had approximately 100 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2013  we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed 

if our distributor relationships are not successful our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected 

we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in various geographic regions and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons including 

 complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are considered medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 24 

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

in addition as part of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the sec adopted disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals known as conflict minerals which are mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries as well as procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to identify and discourage the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals additional reporting obligations are being considered by the european union the implementation of the existing us requirements and any additional requirements in europe could affect the sourcing and availability of metals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts if any contained in our scanner products for example the implementation of these disclosure requirements may decrease the number of suppliers capable of supplying our needs for certain metals thereby negatively affecting our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices our material sourcing is broad based and multitiered and we may be unable to conclusively verify the origins for all metals used in our products we may suffer financial and reputational harm if customers require and we are unable to deliver certification that our products are conflict free regardless we will incur additional costs associated with compliance with these disclosure requirements including timeconsuming and costly efforts to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years congress passed health care reform legislation that president obama signed into law in march 2010 this legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers effective january 1 2013 as a medical device manufacturer we are required to pay an excise tax on the price for which we sell our medical devices in the us this tax applies to most medical devices including our products which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows the medical device excise tax is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations the excise tax expense was 71 million for the year ended december 31 2013 any future changes in the applicability of the medical device excise tax as it applies to us will be recorded as an additional expense or a credit to the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which is becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our 

products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

outside of north america we currently sell our products in europe asia pacific latin america and the middle east and may expand into other countries from time to time for sales of our products outside the us we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 26 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we review our goodwill and asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the qualitative and quantitative analysis used to test goodwill are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

 if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in a current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

we have adopted a shareholders rights’ plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders to date our board of directors has designated 200000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of align or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights’ plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates nondeductible goodwill impairments changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans settlement of income tax audits and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings during the first quarter of 2013 we incurred a 407 million impairment of goodwill which was not deductible for tax purposes 

in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of various income tax incentives which had been previously granted to us in 2002 the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 under these incentives all of the income we earn in costa rica during the twelve year incentive period is exempt from costa rica income tax in order to receive the benefit of these incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain certain minimum levels of fixed asset investments in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2013 as a result of these incentives the provision for income taxes was reduced by 277 million and 218 million for the year ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 034 and 026 in 2013  and 2012  respectively for the three months ended december 31 2013  and 2012  the provision for income taxes was reduced by 64 million and 47 million respectively representing a benefit to diluted net income per share of 012 and 006 respectively our subsidiaries in israel and germany are under audit by the local tax authorities for calendar years 2006 through 2011 and 2007 through 2011 respectively

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

align technology inc is a global medical device company that advanced the invisible orthodontics market with the introduction of the invisalign system in 1999 today we are focused on designing manufacturing and marketing innovative technologyrich products to help dental professionals achieve the clinical results they expect and deliver effective convenient cuttingedge dental treatment options to their patients align technology was founded in march 1997 and is headquartered in san jose california with offices worldwide our international headquarters are located in amsterdam the netherlands we have two operating segments 1 clear aligner known as the invisalign system and 2 scanner and cadcam services sccs known as the itero intraoral scanners and orthocad services 

we received fda clearance in 1998 and began our first commercial sales of invisalign to us orthodontists in 1999 followed by us general practitioner dentists gps in 2002 over the next decade we introduced invisalign to the european market and japan added distribution partners in asiapacific latin america and emea and introduced a full range of treatment options including invisalign express 10 invisalign teen invisalign assist and vivera retainers by 2011 we launched significant new aligner and software features across all invisalign products that make it easier for doctors to use invisalign on more complex cases and introduced invisalign to the people’s republic of china in 2013 we launched smarttrack the next generation of invisalign clear aligner material which became the new standard aligner material for invisalign products most recently we launched invisalign g5 innovations specifically designed for treatment of deep bite malocclusion as well as clincheck pro the next generation invisalign treatment software tool designed to help invisalign providers achieve their treatment goals 

we also sell itero intraoral scanners and provide cadcam services intraoral scanners provide a dental “chairside” platform for accessing valuable digital diagnosis and treatment tools with potential for enhancing accuracy of records treatment efficiency and the overall patient experience we believe there are numerous benefits for customers and the opportunity to accelerate the adoption of invisalign through interoperability with our intraoral scanners the use of digital technologies such as cadcam for restorative dentistry or inoffice restorations has been growing rapidly and intraoral scanning is a critical part of enabling these new digital technologies and procedures in dental practices in late 2012 we commercially launched the invisalign outcome simulator the first invisalign chairside application powered by the itero scanner the interactive application provides dentists and orthodontists an enhanced platform for patient education and is designed to increase treatment acceptance by helping patients visualize the benefits possible with invisalign treatment in january 2014 we announced that the 3m™ true definition scanner was qualified for use with invisalign case submissions this qualification enables invisalign providers with a true definition scanner to submit a digital impression in place of a 

traditional pvs impression as part of the invisalign case submission process the 3m true definition scanner is currently the only thirdparty scanner that has been qualified for use with invisalign treatment we continue to believe in an open systems approach to digital impressions and are committed to working with other intraoral scanning companies interested in developing interoperability for use with invisalign treatment 

the invisalign system is offered in more than 60 countries and has been used to treat more than 25 million patients our itero intraoral scanner which is primarily sold in north america provides dental professionals with an open choice to send digital impressions to any laboratorybased cadcam system or to any of the more than 1200 dental labs worldwide 

our goal is to establish invisalign clear aligners as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish the itero intraoral scanner as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers set forth in the  business strategy  section in this annual report on form 10k 

the successful execution of our business strategy and our results in 2014 and beyond may be affected by a number of other factors which are described below 

      invisalign utilization rates   of cases shipped divided by  of doctors cases were shipped to 

total utilization in the fourth quarter of 2013 was 44 cases per doctor a slight increase from 43 cases in the third quarter of 2013 driven primarily by the increase in utilization by our international customers offset by a decrease 

in utilization by our north american orthodontic customers from 84 to 80 cases per doctor this decrease by our north american orthodontic customers reflects a decline in the number of teenaged cases shipped as summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year on a yearoveryear basis total utilization of 44 cases per doctor in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased from 41 cases in the fourth quarter of 2012 cases reflecting improvements in product and technology over the past year including invisalign g4 and smarttrack aligner material which continues to strengthen our doctors’ clinical confidence in the use of invisalign such that they now utilize invisalign more often and on more complex cases although we expect that over the longterm our utilization rates will gradually improve we expect that period over period comparisons of our utilization rates will fluctuate 

 

 

results of operations 

net revenues by reportable segment comparison for years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  

we group our operations into two reportable segments clear aligner segment and sccs segment 

 35 

the below represents net revenues for our clear aligner segment by region channel and product and our sccs segment by region and product for the year ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  as follows in millions 

 

 

clear aligner case volume by channel and product 

case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by channel and product for the year ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  as follows in thousands 



fiscal year 2013  compared to fiscal year 2012   

total net revenues increased by 1002 million in 2013  as compared to 2012  primarily as a result of invisalign case volume growth across all regions and products as well as increased invisalign noncase revenue 

clear aligner 

clear aligner north america net revenues increased by 471 million or 130 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to invisalign case volume growth of approximately 485 million across all channels and products offset in part by lower average selling prices asp which decreased net revenues by approximately 14 million the decrease in asp was a result of product mix shift towards lower priced invisalign express products combined with the revenue deferral for free midcourse correction as a result of our policy change in june 2013 beginning june 15 2013 we included up to three free midcourse correction orders in our list prices for invisalign full and invisalign teen 

clear aligner international net revenues increased by 369 million or 296 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily driven by invisalign case volume growth of 311 million along with higher asp which resulted in approximately 58 million increase in net revenues the increase in asp was primarily due to the impact from acquiring our distributor in the apac region on april 30 2013 as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates by bringing the apac region direct we began to recognize direct sales of invisalign products sold in that region at our full asp rather than the discounted asp under the distributor agreement the increase in asp was offset in part due to a product mix shift towards lower priced invisalign lite products 

despite our recent product mix shift towards lower priced invisalign products we expect our worldwide asp to trend upwards in the future as a result of higher growth rates in our international markets which typically have higher asp than north america 

invisalign noncase net revenues consisting of training fees and ancillary product revenues increased 456 in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to the consolidation of our vivera product shipments in north america from four shipments per year to one shipment along with increased vivera volume both in north america and international 

sccs 

sccs net revenues increased 51 in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in scanner revenues partially offset by a decrease in cadcam services net revenues as a result of the discontinuation of the orthocad iq services during the fourth quarter of 2012 the increase in scanner revenues in 2013 was as a result of the increase in number of scanners sales recognized in 2013 as compared to 2012 as well as the release of 14 million of revenue previously reserved for the new itero upgrade program which was completed in the first quarter of 2013 

fiscal year 2012  compared to fiscal year 2011   

total net revenues increased 803 million in 2012 primarily as a result of volume growth of 175 across all regions and customer channels in our clear aligner segment and the inclusion of a full year of scanner and cadcam services sccs segment activity in 2012 compared to eight months in 2011 

clear aligner 

revenue from our clear aligner segment increased by 144 due to increased case volumes across all products which resulted in an increase in net revenues of approximately 748 million offset by lower asp which decreased net revenues by approximately 161 million additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined that the actual case refinement usage rate was lower than our estimate and as a result invisalign revenue includes the release of 49 million of revenue previously deferred for case refinement refer to item 8 on this form 10k for further discussion 

north american revenue growth of 145 was driven by increased volumes of 16 in the ortho channel and gp channels due to higher utilization and an increased number of doctors submitting cases which resulted in an increase in net revenues of approximately 504 million lower asp contributed 50 million to a decrease in net revenues as a result of increased discounting from our volume rebate program and a product mix shift towards our lower priced products 

international revenue growth of 119 was mainly due to volume increases of 226 across all products which resulted in an increase in net revenues of approximately 253 million this increase was offset in part by lower asp which resulted in a decrease in net revenues of approximately 120 million primarily due to higher discounts unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a product mix shift towards distributor sales and lower priced products 

invisalign noncase revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increased sales of our vivera product and training 

scanner and cadcam services 

revenue from our scanner and cadcam services segment consisting of scanner and cadcam services increased by 153 million as a result of 182 million increase in north america revenue related to higher scanner volume from a full year of activity in 2012 compared to eight months in 2011 this is partially offset by a 29 million decrease in international revenue due to lower scanner volumes as a result of the termination of our exclusive distribution agreement with straumann for itero intraoral scanners the financial results of cadent have been included in this segment since the acquisition date on april 29 2011 

cost of net revenues and gross profit in millions 

  



 38 

cost of net revenues for our clear aligner and sccs includes salaries for staff involved in the production process the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process amortization of acquired intangible assets from cadent training costs and stockbased compensation expense 

fiscal year 2013  compared to fiscal year 2012   

clear aligner 

gross margin improved slightly in 2013 compared to 2012 due to lower warranty costs as a result of reduced warranty claims corresponding with the change in our midcourse correction policy in june 2013 this gross margin improvement was partially offset by increased material costs primarily related to our new smarttrack material in addition we incurred higher inventory reserves for our prior aligner material which has been substantially replaced by our new smarttrack aligner material 

scanner and cadcam services 

gross margin increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of the release of revenue for amounts previously reserved in 2012 for the new 29 itero scanner upgrade program which was completed in the first quarter of 2013 in addition we had lower manufacturing costs as a result of the closure of our new jersey facility which was completed by october 2012 and a reduction in training costs however these savings were partially offset by higher third party labor service costs and lower manufacturing cost absorption 

fiscal year 2012  compared to fiscal year 2011   

clear aligner 

gross margin remained fairly consistent in 2012 compared to 2011 largely benefiting from higher sales volume that resulted in a decrease in cost per case offset by lower asp 

scanner and cadcam services 

gross margin improved slightly in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily resulting from lower acquisition integration and exit costs partially offset by lower scanner asp as well as higher training costs 

sales and marketing in millions 

  



sales and marketing expense primarily includes sales force and marketing compensation costs including commissions and stockbased compensation expense media and advertising travel and expense related costs clinical education product marketing expenses for trade shows and industry events and allocations of corporate overhead expenses including facilities it and human resource costs 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to higher compensation costs of 164 million largely related to increased headcount including additional employees as a result of the acquisition of our apac distributor higher sales commissions and stockbased compensation in addition we incurred higher advertising and media costs primarily related to network and television media campaigns 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily to higher compensation costs of approximately 50 million which was largely attributable to the inclusion of cadents headcount for the full twelve months of 2012 as compared to only eight months in 2011 we also incurred higher costs related to advertising and industry events of approximately 44 million 

general and administrative in millions 

  



general and administrative expense primarily includes administrative personnel compensation costs including stockbased compensation expense outside consulting services legal expenses depreciation and amortization expense the medical device excise tax which was effective january 1 2013 and allocations of corporate overhead expenses including facilities it and human resource costs 

general and administrative expense for 2013 increased compared to 2012 primarily due to higher compensation related costs of 76 as a result of higher stockbased compensation expense and increased salaries additionally we incurred 71 million of medical device excise tax as a result of new tax regulations effective january 1 2013 these costs were partially offset by lower outside legal expenses 

general and administrative expense for 2012 increased compared to 2011 largely due to higher legal and consulting fees of approximately 108 million related to ongoing litigation we also incurred higher facility related expenses of approximately 25 million as a result of the inclusion of cadents operations for a full twelve months in 2012 compared to only eight months during 2011 our compensation related costs were also higher by 21 million mainly due to our annual compensation adjustments and an increase in headcount these costs were partially offset by lower consulting accounting and legal fees of approximately 74 million that were directly related to the acquisition of cadent in 2011 and lower amortization expense of approximately 21 million related to our noncompete agreements which were fully amortized in 2011 

research and development in millions 

  



research and development expense is expensed as incurred and includes the costs associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products these costs primarily include compensation costs including stockbased compensation expense outside consulting expenses costs associated with conducting clinical and precommercialization trials and testing allocations of corporate overhead expenses including facilities it and human resource costs equipment costs and depreciation and amortization expense 

research and development expense increased slightly during 2013 compared to 2012 due to higher facilities related expenses primarily related to our russia research and development facility and compensation costs offset in part by lower clinical and product innovation research program costs 

research and development expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to compensation costs of approximately 55 million which was largely attributed to the inclusion of cadents headcount for the full twelve months of 2012 compared to only eight months in 2011 

impairment of goodwill in millions 

  



during the first quarter of 2013 we determined that the goodwill for our sccs reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests due to changes in the competitive environment for intraoral scanners which included announcements of new lowpriced scanners targeted at orthodontist and gp dentist in north america as a result this caused us to lower our expectations for growth and profitability for our sccs reporting unit that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our sccs reporting unit below its carrying amount as a result of our analysis we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 407 million in the first quarter of 2013 none of which was deductible for tax purposes refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

during the third quarter of 2012 we determined that the goodwill for our sccs reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests since an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our sccs reporting unit below its carrying amount as a result of our analysis we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of 2012 of 247 million  and an additional 119 million  during the fourth quarter of 2012 representing a change in estimate upon finalizing our 2013 annual budget process for a total impairment charge of 366 million  none of the goodwill impairment charge was deductible for tax purposes and there was no additional impairment that resulted from our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

impairment of longlived assets in millions 

  



the impairment of our longlived assets in 2013 was the result of changes in the competitive environment for intraoral scanners which included announcements of new lowpriced scanners targeted at orthodontist and gp dentist in north america that caused us to lower our expectations for growth and profitability for our sccs reporting unit as a result we determined that the carrying value of the longlived assets was not recoverable and therefore recorded an impairment charge of 263 million refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

other income expense net in millions 

  



other income expense net includes interest income earned on cash and marketable securities balances interest expense foreign currency gains and losses and other miscellaneous income and charges 

other income expense net in 2013 increased slightly due to increased interest income earned on higher balances of cash cash equivalents and investments offset slightly by higher foreign exchange losses 

other income expense net in 2012 decreased by 09 million compared to 2011 as a result of higher foreign exchange losses during 2012 

  

provision for income taxes in millions 

  



the effective tax rate was 310  304  and 258  in fiscal year 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively our effective tax rates in these fiscal years differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to certain foreign earnings primarily from costa rica which are subject to a lower tax rate partially offset by higher state income tax expense the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation charges unrecognized tax benefits and the impairments of goodwill in fiscal year 2013 and 2012 which are not deductible for tax purposes 

as of december 31 2013  approximately 1864 million of undistributed earnings from nonus operations held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as permanently reinvested outside the us accordingly no additional us income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes have been provided thereon we have sufficient cash reserves in the us and do not intend to repatriate our foreign earnings we intend to use the undistributed earnings for local operating expansions and to meet local operating working capital needs if these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we do not expect to realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realizable the available positive evidence at december 31 2013 included historical operating profits and a projection of future income as of december 31 2013  we had a valuation allowance of approximately 351 million  mostly related to foreign net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets because we cannot forecast sufficient future foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets these net operating loss carryforwards will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized at some point in the future 

at december 31 2013  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 424 million  which if not used will begin to expire in 2026 these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code §382 but are expected to be fully realized furthermore we have california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 567 million  which if not used will begin to expire in 2014 at december 31 2013  we had research credit carryforwards of approximately 59 million  for federal purposes and 36 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020 the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 

we account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return we first determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon audit based on its technical merits if a tax position meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold it is then measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information to the extent the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 hr 8 as amended was signed into law this act 

extends the federal research and development credit through december 31 2013 the federal research and development credit 

was reinstated retroactively to january 1 2012 the tax benefit of the federal research and development credit for the twelve 

months ended december 31 2012 resulted in a discrete tax benefit of 05 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 the 

period in which the reinstatement was enacted into law 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales and the proceeds from the sale of our common stock as of december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we had the following cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in thousands 



cash flows  in thousands 

  

as of december 31 2013  we had 4720 million  in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm marketable securities cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments which primarily include commercial paper corporate bonds us dollar denominated foreign corporate bonds us government agency bonds municipal bonds and assetbacked securities 

as of december 31 2013  approximately 2101   million of cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries we have not provided additional us income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately 1864 million of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the us of the total undistributed foreign earnings 1768 million relates to costa rica in the event such earnings are repatriated to the us the earnings would be subject to additional us income taxes reduced by any foreign taxes paid

 significant noncash activities 

 

significant changes in working capital 

 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2107  million for the year ended december 31 2013  primarily consisted of our purchases of marketable securities of 3039 million  and property plant and equipment purchases of 194 million  these uses 

were partially offset by 1227 million  of maturities and sales of our marketable securities along with 77 million  for the acquisition of our asia pacific distributor in april 2013 

net cash used in investing activities was 783  million for the year ended december 31 2012  primarily consisted of our purchase of marketable securities of 675 million  and property and equipment purchases of 383 million  these costs were partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of 252 million and the release of 25 million of funds related to unclaimed merger consideration for the acquisition of cadent on april 29 2011 included in other investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2116  million for the year ended december 31 2011  primarily consisted of our cash paid for the acquisition of cadent of approximately 1876 million  and approximately 304 million  of property plant and equipment purchases we also had restricted cash of approximately 40 million which primarily represented funds we held as unclaimed merger consideration related to the acquisition of cadent on april 29 2011 included in other investing activities these costs were partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities and the proceeds from the sale of equipment of approximately 104 million 

financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities was 382  million for the year ended december 31 2013  resulting from repurchases of our common stock of 951 million  and 44 million  of payroll taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units through share withholdings partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock of 342 million  and 271 million  from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements 

net cash provided by financing activities was 102 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  resulting from approximately 423 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately 172 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements these proceeds were partially offset by approximately 472 million common stock repurchases and 21 million of payroll taxes paid for our employees’ vesting of restricted stock units through share withholdings 

net cash provided by financing activities was 272 million  for the year ended december 31 2011  primarily resulting from approximately 255 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately 114 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased arrangements these proceeds were partially offset by approximately 78 million common stock repurchases and 19 million of taxes paid for our employees’ vesting of restricted stock units through share withholdings 

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting restricted stock units “rsus” which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercises as a result we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods in addition because restricted stock units are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2013  2012  and 2011  we paid 44  million 21  million and 19  million respectively for taxes related to restricted stock units that vested during the periods for executive officers 

stock repurchase 

on october 27 2011 we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 1500 million  of common stock purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market 

during 2012 we repurchased approximately 17 million  shares of common stock at an average price of 2728  per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 472 million  including commissions the common stock repurchases reduced additional paidin capital by approximately 154 million  and increased accumulated deficit by 318 million  during 2013 we repurchased approximately 27  million shares of our common stock at an average price of 3495  per share including commissions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 951 million  the common stock repurchases reduced additional paidin capital by approximately 245 million  and increased accumulated deficit by 706 million  all repurchased shares were retired no further authorization for repurchase remains outstanding as we completed the repurchases under this program as of december 31 2013  

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 

  



our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 267 million  of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2013  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2013  

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities combined with our positive cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

indemnification provisions 

in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify customers vendors lessors and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 

it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period as of december 31 2013  we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we measure and allocate revenue according to the accounting guidance for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements in accounting standards update “asu” 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangementsa consensus of the financial accounting standard board “fasb” emerging issues task force  

multipleelement arrangements “meas”  arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including any combination of productsequipment and services the deliverables included in the meas are separated into more than one unit of accounting when i the delivered productequipment has value to the customer on a standalone basis and ii delivery of the undelivered service elements is probable and substantially in our control arrangement consideration is then allocated to each unit delivered or undelivered based on the relative selling price “rsp” of each unit of accounting based first on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists second on thirdparty evidence “tpe” if it exists and on best estimated selling price “besp” if neither vsoe or tpe exist   

 provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

clear aligner 

we enter into arrangements “treatment plans” that involve multiple future product deliverables invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist include up to 3 optional case refinements case refinement is a finishing tool used to adjust a patients teeth to the desired final position case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment beginning june 15 2013 invisalign full and invisalign teen also include up to three optional midcourse corrections midcourse correction is a treatment adjustment during active treatment if the case is not tracking to the original treatment plan or goals midcourse correction gives doctors the ability to adjust course based on the needs of the individual patient invisalign teen also includes up to six optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered any time throughout treatment 

we determined that our treatment plans except invisalign assist with progress tracking comprise the following deliverables which also represent separate units of accounting singlebatched aligners case refinement midcourse correction and replacement aligners we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each units relative selling price based on besp and recognize the revenue upon the delivery of each unit in the treatment plan we regularly review our estimates of selling price and maintain internal controls over the establishment and update of these estimates 

for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature aligners and services are provided to the dental professional every nine stages “a batch” beginning january 1 2011 we were able to reliably estimate the number of batches which are expected to be shipped for each case based upon our historical experience the amounts allocated to this deliverable are recognized on a prorated basis as each batch is shipped 

prior to 2013 the vivera retainer included four shipments per year and revenue was recognized ratably as each shipment occurred in the first quarter of 2013 we consolidated vivera retainer product shipments down to one shipment per year 

scanners and cadcam services 

we recognize revenues from the sales of itero intraoral scanners and cadcam services cadcam services include scanning services extended warranty for the intraoral scanners a range of itero restorative services and orthocad services such as orthocad irecord we sell intraoral scanners and services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and for additional fees the customer may select an unlimited scanning service agreement over a fixed period of time or extended warranty periods revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured title and risk of loss has passed to customers based on the shipping terms no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts returns and customer incentives can be reliably estimated when intraoral scanners are sold with either an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenue based on each elements relative selling price we estimate the selling price of each element as if it is sold on a standalone basis taking into consideration historical prices as well as our discounting strategies scanner revenue net of related discounts and allowances is recognized when products or equipment have been shipped installed and onsite training completed for certain distributors who provide installation and training to the customer we recognize scanner revenue when the intraoral scanner is shipped to the distributor assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

discounts are deducted from revenue at the time of sale or when the discount is offered whichever is later and free cases or training is included as a deliverable in the multipleelement arrangement assessment returns of products excluding warranty related returns are infrequent and insignificant 

service revenue including itero restorative and all orthocad services are recognized upon delivery or ratably over the contract term as the specified services are performed if a customer selects a pay per use basis for scanning service fees the revenue is recognized as the service is provided 

we offer customers an option to purchase extended warranties on certain products we recognize revenue on these extended warranty contracts ratably over the life of the contract the costs associated with these extended warranty contracts are recognized when incurred 

  stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award we estimate the fair value of marketperformance based restricted stock units using a monte carlo simulation model which requires the input of assumptions including expected term stock price volatility and the riskfree rate of return in addition judgment is required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the reporting units based on relative synergies generated 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of acquisitions and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

impairment of goodwill finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present an event occurs or circumstances changes that suggest an impairment may exist and that it would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit is based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 

we perform an initial assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in performing the qualitative assessment we identify and consider the significance of relevant key factors events and 

circumstances that affect the fair value of our reporting units these factors include external factors such as macroeconomic industry and market conditions as well as entityspecific factors such as our actual and planned financial performance we also give consideration to the difference between the reporting unit fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed if after assessing the totality of relevant events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value and there is no indication of impairment no further testing is performed however if we conclude otherwise the first step of the twostep impairment test is performed by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying value including goodwill 

step one of the goodwill impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the income approach of the reporting units as well as various price or market multiples applied to the reporting units operating results along with the appropriate control premium under the marketing approach both of which are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in note 2 in our consolidated financial statements if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 

during march 2013 changes in the competitive environment for intraoral scanners including announcements from our competitors of new lowpriced scanners targeted at orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in north america caused us to lower our expectations for growth and profitability for our sccs reporting unit the impairment analysis performed for goodwill requires several estimates in computing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we use a discounted cash flow “dcf” approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit utilizing harvest model which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of this business and is most consistent with the approach a market place participant would use as a result we determined that goodwill related only to our sccs reporting unit should be tested for impairment as of march 2013 due to these facts and circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our sccs reporting unit below its carrying amount based on our analysis there was no implied goodwill for the sccs reporting unit therefore we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 407 million in the three months ended march 31 2013 which represented the entire goodwill balance in the sccs reporting unit there was no triggering event related to the clear aligner goodwill refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

 the remaining goodwill is entirely attributable to our clear aligner reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing using the qualitative approach discussed above and found no impairment as the fair value of our clear aligner reporting unit was significantly in excess of the carrying value 

finitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value our estimates of future cash flows attributable to our longlived assets require significant judgment based on our historical and anticipated results and are subject to many factors factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends significant loss of customers and changes in the competitive environment we use a dcf approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit utilizing harvest model which we believe is the most reliable indicator of fair value of a business and is most consistent with the approach of a marketplace participant would use the estimation of fair value utilizing a dcf approach includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected growth rates and the selection of discount rates as well as assumptions regarding general economic and business conditions and the structure that would yield the highest economic value among other factors key assumptions used in measuring the fair values of sccs reporting unit included the discount rate based on the weightedaverage cost of capital and revenue growth the fair value of sccs’s trademark was determined using a riskadjusted dcf model under the relieffromroyalty method the royalty rate used was based on a consideration of market rates the fair value of sccs’s finitelived customer relationships was determined using a dcf model under the multiperiod excess earnings method we recorded a longlived asset impairment in the quarter ended march 31 2013 due to changes in the competitive environment for our intraoral scanners including announcements from our competitors of new lowpriced scanners targeted at orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in north america there was no triggering event related to the clear aligner asset group refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 

we account for uncertainty in income taxes pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates due to new information to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot realize our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be realized the available positive evidence at december 31 2013  included historical operating profits and a projection of future income sufficient to realize most of our remaining deferred tax assets as of december 31 2013  it was considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain foreign loss carryovers as we are unable to forecast sufficient future profits to realize the deferred tax assets 

accounting guidance for stockbased compensation prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled 95 million as of december 31 2013 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable we follow the tax law ordering method to determine when excess tax benefits have been realized and consider only the direct impacts of awards when calculating the amount of windfalls or shortfalls 

as of december 31 2013  us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided for on a cumulative total of 1864 million  we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credit and foreign withholding taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate 

securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 2290 million  invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2013  and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

we operate in north america europe asiapacific costa rica and israel as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

our company 

align technology inc “we” “our” “align” designs manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy intraoral scanners and cadcam computeraided design and computeraided manufacturing digital services used in dentistry orthodontics and dental records storage align technology was founded in march 1997 and incorporated in delaware in april 1997 our headquarters are located at 2560 orchard parkway san jose california 95131 and our telephone number is 4084701000 our international headquarters are located in amsterdam the netherlands 

we have two operating segments 1 clear aligner known as the invisalign system and 2 scanners and cadcam services sccs known as the itero intraoral scanner and orthocad services for the year ended december 31 2012 clear aligner revenues represent approximately 92 percent of worldwide revenue while scanners and cadcam services represent the remaining 8 percent of worldwide revenues we distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers orthodontists and general practitioner dentists or gps sell as to restorative dentists including prosthodontists periodontists and oral surgeons 

we received the united states food and drug administration “fda” clearance to market the invisalign system in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device in order to provide invisalign treatment to their patients orthodontists and gps must initially complete an invisalign training course the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asiapacific latin america and japan we use a distributor model for the sale of our products in noncore country markets in the asia pacific europe the middle east and africa emea and latin america regions 

on april 29 2011 we acquired cadent holdings inc “cadent” a leading provider of 3d digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry since this acquisition we manufacture the itero digital intraoral scanner and provide cadcam restorative models for use by dental professionals andor labs and services for orthodontic digital procedures scanners and cadcam services are sold through our direct sales force and distribution partners 

clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting nearly a billion people or approximately 50 to 75 of the population of major developed countries approximately 68 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 26 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign treatment—our served market 

in the united states “us” orthodontists and gps treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices as needed options available to attempt to improve treatment aesthetics include using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bonding brackets on the inside or lingual surface of the patient’s teeth the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement known in the industry as “chair time” including the initial 

diagnosis creation of an appropriate treatment plan and bonding of the brackets to the patient’s teeth and attachment of arch wires to the brackets subsequent visits involve tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks until the final visit when the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient’s teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable orthodontic aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  the dental professional prepares and sends us a patient’s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition the dental professional can also submit an intraoral scan or “digital impression” through an itero intraoral scanner instead of a physical pvs impression 

preparation of 3d computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition using computed tomography known as ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition in cases where the dental professional submits a digital impression this step in the process is eliminated 

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck software  we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan the clincheck plan simulates appropriate tooth movement broken down into a series of twoweek increments and details timing and placement of any attachments that will be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment  upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional  from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck animation aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment plan after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and resulting clincheck treatment plan 

retention  upon completion of the treatment the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product 

scanners and cadcam services segment 

although advancements have been made in materials used for taking dental impressions since their introduction one hundred years ago the overall impression process has remained relatively unchanged shortcomings such as voids pulls and the general margin for error have remained inherent in conventional impressions and subsequent retakes create unnecessary cost increase for a clinical practice intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of the patient’s teeth using a handheld intraoral scanner inside the mouth intraoral scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the mess discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions the digital model created with an intraoral scanner is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration “remakes” so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction 

as the only intraoral scanner system in the market based on parallel confocal imaging the itero and ioc intraoral scanners utilize laser and optical scanning to capture the contours of the patient’s dentition gingival structures and the bite the intraoral scanners capture 100000 points of laser light in perfect focus without the use of powder to coat the teeth allowing for contact of the wand and tooth the benefit of contact scanning for the clinician is it eliminates the challenge of hovering over the teeth at a specific distance which can be complicated for the patient they enjoy a more comfortable powder free experience which allows the clinician to provide a very comfortable patient centric experience within minutes an accurate 3d digital impression can be viewed on the screen the 3d digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments invisalign digital impression submission digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis and computer aided placement of traditional braces and orthodontic retainers and appliances 

both itero and ioc intraoral scanners consist of a mobile computer unit display screen a control foot pedal and scanning wand to scan and capture a patient’s dentition full or partial dental arch system software features include occlusal map eraser tool edge trim tool realtime modeling and an option to submit scans for invisalign treatment the systems provide doctors and labs with an open choice to export generic digital files of their digital impression to use with other third party dental service providers this allows the digital impression to integrate with cone beam ct images for implant and orthodontic treatment planning orthocad services are additional services available with our scanners inoffice training on the system and features is provided after the unit is delivered to the practice

proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck software the invisalign doctor site   and enhanced features such as invisalign g3 and invisalign g4 are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue   

our itero scanners include orthodontic software restorative software or both and the invisalign outcome simulator the orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee the invisalign outcome simulator is not available for sale separately 

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign treatment as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by focusing on the following key strategic initiatives 

 manufacturing and suppliers 

our manufacturing facilities are located in juarez mexico where we conduct our aligner fabrication distribute and repair our scanners perform our cadcam services and in or yehuda israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand the final assembly of our itero scanner is performed by a third party manufacturer located in israel our digital planning of the invisalign system and interpretation for itero restorative cases are conducted primarily at our facility located in san jose costa rica information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we will continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica in addition to improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we will continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source the need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs see item 1a risk factors — “we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and   operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases” 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused primarily on the invisalign system and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and gps worldwide in north america our direct sales organization consists of approximately 200 people which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration internationally we have approximately 60 people engaged in sales and sales support for the invisalign system our direct sales organization in north america is comprised of a team of territory managers and to a lesser extent territory specialists these territory specialists are used to enhance coverage in larger territories especially with our lower volume gp customers due to the success of this sales coverage model we expect to add approximately 20 sales representatives in 2013 predominantly in north america in addition when we transition our asiapacific distributor to a direct sales model in may 2013 as described in the paragraph below we will acquire approximately 15 additional sales representatives in that region 

currently we have three distribution partners that sell the invisalign system in smaller noncore country markets in the asiapacific emea and latin america regions we evaluate adding distribution partners in other noncore country markets on a casebycase basis or assess modifying our current distribution agreements as our international business grows based on the continued progress in the asiapacific distributor region we expect to revert to a direct sales model in this region in the second quarter of 2013 and therefore will not renew the asiapacific distribution agreement when it expires in april 2013 as a result on may 1 2013 four of the largest indirect country markets of australia new zealand hong kong and singapore will revert back to a direct sales region and we will begin to recognize direct sales of invisalign products sold in that region at our full average selling price asp rather than at the discounted average sales price under the distribution agreement in 2012 this distributor accounted for approximately 3 of worldwide revenues and we expect them to become an even more meaningful contributor to revenue growth beginning in may 2013 in the near term however the assumption of the direct operating costs will offset the uplift to asps although we expect volumes and revenues will increase we may experience 

difficulties in achieving the anticipated financial benefits the remaining eight indirect country markets in brunei indonesia macau malaysia philippines south korea taiwan thailand and vietnam will likely continue under a distribution model 

for our intraoral scanners we have approximately 21 direct sales representatives in north america our smaller intraoral scanner sales team also leverages leads generated by our invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows we also have distribution partners that sell our itero intraoral scanner in north america effective october 2012 we terminated our agreement with straumann as our exclusive distribution partner for itero intraoral scanners in europe and our nonexclusive distribution partner north america as a result in the near term we expect to have very few scanner sales internationally as we evaluate the most effective sales model to restage growth in this market 

we market invisalign by communicating the benefits of the invisalign system to dental professionals through our training programs online and traditional mail campaigns trade shows trade journals and print we also promote the benefits of invisalign through our integrated consumer marketing platform which combines traditional print and broadcast media with a balanced mix of public relations event marketing and social media the goal of this platform is to raise awareness of invisalign and invisalign teen as the best options for a healthy beautiful smile among adults and teenagers in addition our consumer marketing platform enables us to help prospective patients find a great invisalign treatment practice that can meet their needs for intraoral scanners in addition to leveraging invisalign customer events and industry tradeshows to communicate the benefits of digital scanning to dental professionals we also have training programs educational websites and limited print advertising 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps in 2012 we had more than 34230 active invisalign providers and more than 3200 intraoral scanner installed based worldwide 

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans our research and development expenses were 429 million  for 2012 372 million  for 2011 and 260 million  for 2010 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms our research and development activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking precommercialization trial and testing as well as making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2012 we had 280 issued us patents 141 pending us patent applications and 224 foreign issued patents as well as 134 pending foreign patent applications 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends related to our two operating segments customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve for example european sales of invisalign treatment are often weaker in the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and 

teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases for our sccs segment capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the nature of invisalign treatment which is prescribed by a doctor and therefore no two cases are alike we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which treatment data or “a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our invisalign backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future invisalign sales our quarterly invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter we define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where payment is reasonably assured and credit and financing is approved but the scanner has not yet shipped our intraoral scanner backlog as of december 31 2012 was not material 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive market and we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we also face competition from early stage companies although the number of competitors varies by segment currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc and dentsply international inc information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a  of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

key competitive factors include 

 we believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

we believe we are in compliance with all fda federal and state laws and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations 

us 

us food and drug administration  in the us we must comply with applicable fda quality system dental and medical device regulations identified in the code of federal regulations cfr our invisalign products and intraoral scanners are classified as class ii medical devices the invisalign system has received premarket clearance from the fda 

pursuant to the 510k premarket notification procedure allowing us to market the invisalign family of products in the us our intraoral scanners are 510k exempt with special controls which allows us to market this product in the us without submitting a 510k premarket notification we are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state of california food and drug branch fdb for compliance with quality system regulations we maintain applicable city state and federal licenses and registrations for each of our facilities 

if the fda determines that we do not comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market our products andor criminal prosecution 

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996  under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of patient health information confidentiality and security of patient medical records and the circumstances under which these records may be used and released by healthcare professionals and their business associates are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and the security standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and the security standard governs the technical physical and administrative safe guards used to ensure the availability of patient records and to protect the unauthorized release or disclosure of patient information the privacy and security standards apply to healthcare providers health insurance plans and healthcare clearinghouses referred to as “covered entities” as well as business associates who perform services for covered entities and have access to protected patient information we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements 

other federal and state laws  as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business we are a medical device manufacturer subject to fda regulations these regulations among other things require that we maintain device and facilities registrations and listings as well as promote our products consistent with our fda 510k clearances furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions under the federal antikickback statutes prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws which are evolving at the federal and state levels are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions furthermore various state laws require us to report payments and other transfers of value made to dental professionals and teaching hospitals to state regulatory bodies

 item 1a risk factors 

we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our net revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign treatment for any reason a continued weakness in general economic conditions or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect net revenues gross margin and net income 

we expect that net revenues from the sale of the invisalign system primarily invisalign full and invisalign teen will continue to account for the vast majority of our total net revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the us economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced the patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results continued weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners in addition invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our net revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we 

have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products 

the frequency of use of the invisalign system by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of the invisalign system by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products 

in response to challenges in our business including increased competition we have in the past reduced the list price of our products we also provide volume based discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs if we expand our discount programs in the future or participation in these programs increases if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue or if sales by our distributors grows at a faster pace than our direct sales our average selling price would be adversely affected and our net revenues gross margin and net income may be reduced furthermore although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our net revenues and income are generated in foreign currencies net revenues and income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of net revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to capacity constraints at our existing facilities 

we are subject to growth related risks including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects in addition in order to meet the demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion we opened a new manufacturing facility in juarez mexico at the end of 2011 we completed the transition of virtually all our scanner distribution repair and cadcam services from our new jersey facility to this facility in juarez mexico in the third quarter of 2012 in addition in october 2012 we transitioned our intraoral scanner research and development and manufacturing operations in or yehuda israel into a new larger facility in the same city expansion can inherently include additional costs and startup inefficiencies as well as the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated synergies economies of scale or other value periods of contraction or reduced net sales or other factors affecting particular sites create other challenges 

  because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements in addition if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results 

we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions which may have an adverse effect on our business 

we acquired cadent holdings inc in april 2011 we acquired cadent for their people their technology and their existing revenue streams such as orthocad irecord and orthocad icast in addition to their intraoral scanning technology this acquisition is expected to strengthen our ability to drive adoption of the invisalign system by integrating invisalign treatment more fully with mainstream tools and procedures in doctors’ practices in addition we believe that the combination of the two companies will help accelerate the use of intraoral scanning in the dental industry by leveraging align’s global sales reach extensive professional and consumer marketing capabilities and large customer base we also expect to complete the acquisition of our asiapacific distributor in the second quarter of 2013 we may experience difficulties in achieving the anticipated financial or strategic benefits of these acquisitions potential risks include 

 if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business with our existing business our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our net revenues while controlling our expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline or significantly fluctuate some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

 15 

 to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our net revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in net revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to 

 16 

 if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and produce enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with the invisalign system since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration “fda” and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our net revenues to decline 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our net revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products to our customers if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our net revenues and operating profits could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of net revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our san jose california facility we also carry out research and development at locations in san jose costa rica and moscow russia in addition our customercare accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in costa rica we also have operations in israel where the design and wand assembly intraoral scanner manufacturing and digital modeling of our intraoral scanners occurs our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

 17 

 

if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the timeframe our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our net revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the markets for our products is intense and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the united states many of these manufacturers including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive the expiration of key certain patents commencing in 2017 owned by us may result in additional competition large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of 

market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues volume growth net income losses and stock price we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations net revenues and operating results 

we are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the clincheck and myaligntech software software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our 

customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2012  we had issued 280 us patents 141 pending us patent applications and 224 foreign issued patents and 134 pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we believe our internal control over financial reporting is currently effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we review our goodwill and asset group for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the valuations used to determine the fair values used to test goodwill and the undiscounted cash flows used to evaluate the recoverability of the asset group are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates changes in certain assumptions including revenue growth rates discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or the asset group may be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or asset group are determined 

during the third quarter of 2012 we determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis for our scanner and cadcam services reporting unit as a result we performed a goodwill impairment test as of september 30 2012 for our scanner and cadcam services reporting unit and concluded that the goodwill within this reporting unit was impaired based on our step one analysis we concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of the goodwill for the sccs reporting unit we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of 2012 of 247 million  and an additional 119 million  during the fourth quarter of 2012 representing a change in estimate for a total impairment charge of 366 million  none of the goodwill impairment charge was deductible for tax purposes as of december 31 2012 the remaining amount of goodwill associated with our sccs reporting unit is 407 million  

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed we had two executive departures in fiscal 2012 and we recently announced the departure of our chief financial officer effective march 4 2013 while we have since hired replacements for the 2012 departures and are currently conducting a search for a new cfo there is always risk of uncertainty and instability relating to our ability to find highly qualified successors for certain executive positions and to transition the duties and responsibilities of any departing key executive in an orderly manner in addition our ability to recognize revenue on the direct sales of our intraoral scanners depends in part upon our ability to schedule and staff trainings the loss of the services provided by these individuals or our ability to timely hire such personnel in sufficient numbers based on our volume growth may harm our business if we are unable to retain our trainers or replace such individuals with persons having equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise in newly hired personnel or accurately predict the number of such personnel needed our net revenues could be materially harmed   

  if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our itero scanner and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 

we rely on a third party manufacturer in israel to assemble our itero scanner as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets as of december 31 2012  our north american sales organization consisted of approximately 200 people internationally we had approximately 80 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2012  we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our net revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our net revenues may be harmed 

if our distributor relationships are not successful our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected 

we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in various geographic regions and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons including 

 22 

 complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years congress recently passed health care reform legislation that president obama signed into law in march 2010 the enacted legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 each medical device manufacturer will have to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 percent of the price for which 

such manufacturer sells its medical devices in the us this tax applies to all medical devices including our products which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

outside of north america we currently sell our products in europe asiapacific latin america and the middle east and may expand into other countries from time to time for sales of our products outside the us we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 24 

 in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

 if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid shortterm fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in an current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

we have adopted a shareholders rights’ plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders to date our board of directors has designated 200000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of align or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights’ plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates nondeductible goodwill impairments changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans settlement of income tax audits and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings during 2012 we incurred a 366 million  impairment of goodwill which was not deductible for tax purposes 

in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of the tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 under these incentives all of the income we earn in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2012 as a result of these incentives income taxes were reduced by   218 million  in 2012 in order to receive the benefit of the incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results our subsidiary in israel is under audit by the local tax authority for calendar years 2006 through 2011

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

align technology inc is a global medical device company that pioneered the invisible orthodontics market with the introduction of the invisalign system in 1999 today we are focused on designing manufacturing and marketing innovative technologyrich products to help dental professionals achieve the clinical results they expect and deliver effective convenient cuttingedge dental treatment options to their patients align technology was founded in march 1997 and is headquartered in san jose california with offices worldwide our international headquarters are located in amsterdam the netherlands we have two operating segments 1 clear aligner known as the invisalign system and 2 scanner and cadcam services sccs known as the itero intraoral scanners and orthocad services 

we received fda clearance in 1998 and began our first commercial sales of invisalign to us orthodontists in 1999 followed by us general practitioner dentists gps in 2002 over the next decade we introduced invisalign to the european market and japan added distribution partners in asiapacific latin america and emea and introduced a full range of treatment options including invisalign express 10 invisalign teen invisalign assist and vivera retainers by 2011 we launched invisalign g3 and invisalign g4 which includes significant new aligner and software features across all invisalign products that make it easier for doctors to use invisalign on more complex cases and introduced invisalign to the people’s republic of china most recently we launched smarttrack the next generation of invisalign clear aligner material which became the new standard aligner material for invisalign clear aligner products in north america and europe beginning january 21 2013 and for other international markets where we have received regulatory approval in the first quarter of 2013 

in 2011 we acquired cadent holdings inc a leading provider of 3d digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry and makers of the itero intraoral scanner and orthocad services we believe that the combination of align’s and cadent’s technologies and capabilities creates greater growth opportunities for align by bringing innovative new invisalign treatment tools to customers and by extending the value of intraoral scanning in dental practices intraoral scanners provide a dental “chairside” platform for accessing valuable digital diagnosis and treatment tools with potential for enhancing accuracy of records treatment efficiency and the overall patient experience we believe there are numerous benefits for customers and the opportunity to accelerate the adoption of invisalign through interoperability with our intraoral scanners the use of digital technologies such as cadcam for restorative dentistry or inoffice restorations has been growing rapidly and intraoral scanning is a critical part of enabling these new digital technologies and procedures in dental practices since the acquisition we have launched significant product options and software enhancements to the scanner product line in late 2012 we commercially launched the invisalign outcome simulator the first invisalign chairside application powered by the itero scanner the interactive application provides dentists and orthodontists an enhanced platform for patient education and is designed to increase treatment acceptance by helping patients visualize the benefits possible with invisalign treatment the new itero scanner was available in north america beginning in february 2013 and will be available soon thereafter in select international markets as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures 

the invisalign system is offered in more than 45 countries and has been used to treat more than 20 million patients our itero intraoral scanner is available in over 25 countries and provide dental professionals with an open choice to send digital impressions to any laboratorybased cadcam system or to any of the more than 1800 dental labs worldwide 

our goal is to establish the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by focusing on the key strategic initiatives set forth in the  business strategy  section in this annual report on form 10k 

in addition to the successful execution of our business strategy there are a number of other factors which may affect our results in 2013 and beyond which are described below 

 

     

 

       invisalign utilization rates   of cases shipped divided by  of doctors cases were shipped to 

total utilization in the fourth quarter of 2012 decreased slightly to 41 cases per doctor compared to 42 cases in the third quarter driven primarily by the decrease in utilization by our north american orthodontic customers from 77 to 73 cases per doctor as well as expansion of our submitting international customers this decrease by our north american orthodontic customers reflects a decline in the number of teenaged cases shipped as teen case starts are down in the fourth quarter following the seasonally busier summer months although we expect that over the longterm our utilization rates will gradually improve we expect that period over period comparisons of our utilization rates will fluctuate

results of operations 

net revenues by reportable segment comparison for years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

we group our operations into two reportable segments clear aligner segment and scanners and cadcam services segment 

 the below represents net revenues for our clear aligner segment by region channel and product and our scanner and cadcam services segment by region and product for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 as follows in millions 



 

1 in the fourth quarter of 2012 we identified an error that the actual case refinement usage rate was lower than our estimate and as a result we recorded a net revenue release of 49 million previously deferred for case refinement of which 52 million was a correction of an error of which 45 million relates to the first three quarters for the fiscal year 2012 and 07 million relates to the fiscal year 2011 the adjustment was not material to any quarter within 2012 the net amount of 49 million is not material to the results of operations for twelve months ended december 31 2012 

2 net revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 includes a 143 million release of revenue previously deferred for invisalign teen replacement aligners excluding the 143 million for the invisalign teen replacement aligners the percentage change from 2010 to 2011 was approximately 416 

3 as the acquisition of cadent closed on april 29 2011 the year ended december 31 2011 balances for scanners and cadcam services only reflect eight months of revenues 

clear aligner case volume by channel and product 

case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by channel and product for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 as follows in thousands 



fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 

total net revenues increased 803 million in 2012 primarily as a result of volume growth of 175 across all regions and customer channels in our clear aligner segment and the inclusion of a full year of scanner and cadcam services sccs segment activity in 2012 compared to eight months in 2011 

clear aligner 

revenue from our clear aligner segment increased by 144 due to increased case volumes across all products partially offset by lower asp additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 we determined that the actual case refinement usage rate was lower than our estimate and as a result invisalign revenue includes the release of 49 million of revenue previously deferred for case refinement refer to item 8 on this form 10k for further discussion 

north american revenue growth of 145 was driven by increased volumes of 16 in the ortho channel and gp channels due to higher utilization and an increased number of doctors submitting cases asps were slightly lower due to increased discounting from our volume rebate program and a product mix shift towards our lower priced products 

 international revenue growth of 119 was mainly due to volume increases of 226 across all products offset by lower asps due to higher discounts unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a product mix shift towards distributor sales and lower priced products 

invisalign noncase revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were higher in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to increased sales of our vivera product and training 

scanner and cadcam services 

revenue from our scanner and cadcam services segment consisting of scanner and cadcam services increased by 153 million as a result of 182 million increase in north america revenue related to higher scanner volume from a full year of activity in 2012 compared to eight months in 2011 this is partially offset by a 29 million decrease in international revenue due to lower scanner volume as a result of the termination of our exclusive distribution agreement with straumann for itero intraoral scanners the financial results of cadent have been included in this segment since the acquisition date on april 29 2011 

fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

total net revenues increased 926 million in 2011 as a result of worldwide volume growth across all customer channels and the inclusion of our scanner and cadcam services segment 

geographically both north america and international revenue increased by 1023 million due to an 186 growth in case volume favorable foreign exchange rates and the inclusion of eight months of scanner and cadcam service revenues 

invisalign case volume growth was driven by both improved utilization and an increase in the number of doctors submitting cases 

revenue from our clear aligner segment consisting of our invisalign products increased by 167 as a result of additional case volumes across all products the most significant volume percentage increases were in the invisalign teen and assist products although invisalign teen case volume increased 324 revenue for invisalign teen was comparable to the prior year primarily because of the 143 million release of deferred revenue in 2010 invisalign assist revenue growth was comprised of both an increase in case volume and additional revenue being recognized as each batch is shipped over the course of treatment instead of deferring until the final batch shipment additionally invisalign noncase revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased sales of our vivera product 

since date of the acquisition until the end of the 2011 fiscal year end the scanner and cadcam services segment generated 281 million of revenue from sales of itero and ioc scanners and orthocad services 

cost of net revenues and gross profit in millions 

  



 

1 the scanners and cadcam services segment was created as a result of our acquisition of cadent on april 29 2011 and the financial results for that segment reflect the activity since that date 

cost of net revenues for our clear aligner and sccs includes salaries for staff involved in the production process the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process amortization of acquired intangible assets from cadent training costs and stockbased compensation expense 

fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 

clear aligner 

gross margin remained fairly consistent 2012 compared to 2011 largely benefiting from higher sales volume that resulted in a decrease in cost per case offset by lower asps 

scanner and cadcam services 

gross margin improved slightly in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily resulting from lower acquisition integration and exit costs partially offset by lower asps from our scanners as well as higher training costs 

fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

gross margin decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the acquisition of our scanner and cadcam services segment from cadent which carries a lower margin at approximately 235 compared to 785 for our clear aligner segment compared to 2010 our 2011 clear aligner gross margin remained flat due to higher cost per case resulting from higher material costs which was partially offset by higher case volumes we also incurred amortization costs related to the acquired technology from cadent of approximately 07 million and exit costs related to the consolidation of our new jersey operations of approximately 08 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

sales and marketing in millions 

  



sales and marketing expense includes sales force and marketing compensation including travelrelated costs media and advertising clinical education expenses for trade shows and industry events product marketing and stockbased compensation expense 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 due primarily due to higher payroll and payrollrelated costs of approximately 50 million which was largely attributable to the inclusion of cadents headcount for the full twelve months of 2012 as compared to only eight months in 2011 we also incurred higher costs related to advertising and industry events of approximately 44 million 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to compensation costs of approximately 152 million that were related to an increase in headcount as well as the inclusion of cadent sales and marketing personnel additionally we incurred higher clinical education costs primarily related to our international launch of invisalign g3 media and advertising related target tv advertising and travelrelated costs of approximately 92 million 

general and administrative in millions 

  



general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel outside consulting services legal expenses and stockbased compensation expense 

general and administrative expense for 2012 increased compared to 2011 largely due to higher legal and consulting fees of approximately 108 million related to ongoing litigation we also incurred higher facility related expenses of approximately 25 million as a result of the inclusion of cadents operations for a full twelve months in 2012 compared to only eight months during 2011 our payroll and payrollrelated expenses were also higher by 21 million mainly due to our annual compensation adjustments and an increase in headcount these costs were partially offset by lower consulting accounting and legal fees of approximately 74 million that were directly related to the acquisition of cadent in 2011 and lower amortization expense of approximately 21 million related to our noncompete agreements which were fully amortized in 2011 

general and administrative expense for 2011 increased compared to 2010 primarily due to compensation costs of approximately 123 million resulting from compensation and related benefits and increased in headcount due to the cadent acquisition we also incurred higher consulting accounting legal and travel costs of approximately 112 million which was primarily related to the acquisition and integration of cadent into our business operations 

research and development in millions

research and development expense increased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to payroll and payrollrelated costs of approximately 55 million which was largely attributed to the inclusion of cadents headcount for the full twelve months of 2012 compared to only eight months in 2011 

research and development expense increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher compensation costs of approximately 66 million as a result of increased headcount due to the cadent acquisition in addition we paid 20 million related to the cadent joint development agreement that we entered into in january 2011 before the completion of the acquisition in april 2011 we also incurred higher travel and outside service costs of approximately 11 million 

impairment of goodwill in millions 

  



during the third quarter of 2012 we determined that the goodwill for our sccs reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests since an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our sccs reporting unit below its carrying amount as a result of our analysis we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of 2012 of 247 million  and an additional 119 million  during the fourth quarter of 2012 representing a change in estimate upon finalizing our 2013 annual budget process for a total impairment charge of 366 million  none of the goodwill impairment charge was deductible for tax purposes and there was no additional impairment that resulted from our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012 refer to note 5 for details of the impairment analysis 

litigation settlement costs in millions 

  



on october 19 2010 we entered into a memorandum of understanding to resolve a complaint filed by dr leiszler as a result we recorded a total litigation settlement charge of 45 million in 2010 for settlement costs there were no litigation settlement costs in 2012 and 2011 

insurance settlement in millions

interest income and other expense net include interest income earned on cash balances interest expense foreign currency translation gains and losses and other miscellaneous charges 

interest income in 2012 was largely consistent with 2011 other expense net increased in 2012 compared to 2011 by 11 million reflecting increase in foreign exchange losses during 2012 

interest income in 2011 was consistent with 2010 other expense net decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 by 03 million reflecting increase in foreign exchange gain during 2011 

  

provision for income taxes in millions 

  



the effective tax rate was 304 258 and 272 in fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our effective tax rates in these fiscal years differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to certain foreign earnings primarily from costa rica which are subject to a lower tax rate and foreign tax credits partially offset by state income tax expense the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation charges and in fiscal year 2012 impairment of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes 

as of december 31 2012 approximately 1092 million of undistributed earnings from nonus operations held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as permanently reinvested outside the us accordingly no additional us income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes have been provided thereon determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and 

feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is not more likely than not that we expect to recover our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable the available positive evidence at december 31 2012 included historical operating profits and a projection of future income as of december 31 2012 we had a valuation allowance of approximately 271 million  mostly related to foreign net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets because we cannot forecast sufficient future foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets these net operating loss carryforwards will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized at some point in the future 

at december 31 2012 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 787 million  which if not used will begin to expire in 2026 these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code § 382 but are expected to be fully realized furthermore we have california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 621 million  which if not used will begin to expire in 2013 at december 31 2012 we had research credit carryforwards of approximately 50 million  for federal purposes and 34 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021 the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 

on january 2 2013 president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which would retroactively extend the federal research tax credit for two years through december 31 2013 as a result we expect to record a favorable benefit of approximately 05 million during the first quarter of 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales and the proceeds from the sale of our common stock as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we had the following cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in thousands 

  



cash flows  in thousands 

  



as of december 31 2012  we had 3561 million  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments which include corporate bonds us dollar denominated foreign corporate bonds and us government agency bonds 

as of december 31 2012  approximately 1351 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries we have not provided additional us income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately 1092 million of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings that are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the us 1054 million of the total undistributed foreign earnings relate to costa rica in the event such earnings are repatriated to the us the earnings would be subject to additional us income taxes reduced by any foreign taxes paid

 changes in working capital 

 investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 783 million for the year ended december 31 2012 primarily consisted of our purchase of marketable securities of 675 million and property and equipment purchases of 383 million these costs were partially offset by net maturities of marketable securities of 252 million and the release of 25 million of funds related to unclaimed merger consideration for the acquisition of cadent on april 29 2011 

net cash used in investing activities was 2116 million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily consisted of our cash paid for the acquisition of cadent of approximately 1876 million and approximately 304 million of property plant and equipment purchases we also had restricted cash of approximately 40 million which primarily represents funds we hold as unclaimed merger consideration related to the acquisition of cadent on april 29 2011 these costs were partially offset by net maturities of marketable securities and the proceeds from the sale of equipment of approximately 104 million 

net cash used in investing activities was 159 million for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily consisted of approximately 364 million for purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment which was partially offset by net maturities of our marketable securities of 206 million although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 102 million  for the year ended december 31 2012 resulting from approximately 423 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately 172 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased compensation arrangements these proceeds were partially offset by approximately 472 million common stock repurchases and 21 million of taxes paid for our employees’ vesting of restricted stock units 

net cash provided by financing activities was 272 million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily resulting from approximately 255 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately 114 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased arrangements these proceeds were partially offset by approximately 78 million common stock repurchases and 20 million of taxes paid for our employees’ vesting of restricted stock units 

net cash provided by financing activities was 147 million for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily resulting from approximately 118 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately 40 million from excess tax benefit from our sharebased arrangements these proceeds were partially offset by approximately 10 million of taxes paid for our employees’ vesting of restricted stock units 

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting restricted stock units “rsus” which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercises as a result we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods in addition because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2012 2011 and 2010 we paid 21 million 19 million and 11 million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers respectively 

stock repurchase 

on october 27 2011 we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 1500 million  of common stock purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market during 2012 we repurchased approximately 17 million  shares of common stock at an average price of 2728  per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 472 million  including commissions the common stock repurchases reduced additional paidin capital by approximately 154 million  and increased accumulated deficit by 318 million  all repurchased shares were retired as of december 31 2012  there remains 951 million  under our existing stock repurchase authorization 

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 

  



our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 206 million  of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2012 we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2012 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities combined with our positive cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

indemnification provisions 

in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products we indemnify certain parties customers vendors lessors and other parties with respect to certain matters including but not limited to services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us among other things to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 

it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement additionally we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial position however to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period as of december 31 2012 we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation 

goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue according to the accounting guidance for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements in accounting standards update “asu” 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangementsa consensus of the financial accounting standard board “fasb”emerging issues task force  

multipleelement arrangements “meas”  arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including any combination of productsequipment services and extended warranties the deliverables included in the meas are separated into more than one unit of accounting when i the delivered productequipment has value to the customer on a standalone basis and ii delivery of the undelivered service elements is probable and substantially in our control arrangement consideration is then allocated to each unit delivered or undelivered based on the relative selling price “rsp” of each unit of accounting based first on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists second on thirdparty evidence “tpe” if it exists and on estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe or tpe exist   

 

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur we have not recorded any estimated losses for the periods presented provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

clear aligner 

we enter into arrangements “treatment plans” that involve multiple future product deliverables for example included in the price of invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist we offer optional case refinement which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patients teeth to the desired final position case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment invisalign teen also includes up to six optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered at any time throughout treatment 

we use vsoe adjusted by estimated usage rates for case refinements and replacement aligners to determine the relative selling price in the absence of vsoe we determine our best estimate of selling price as if it is sold on a standalone basis and take into consideration our pricing and discounting strategies market conditions as well as historical price we regularly review our estimates of selling price and maintain internal controls over the establishment and update of these estimates 

we determined that our treatment plans except invisalign assist with progress tracking are comprised of three possible deliverables that represent separate units of accounting singlebatched aligners case refinement and replacement aligners we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each units relative selling price and recognize the revenue upon the delivery of each unit in the treatment plan 

for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature aligners and services are provided to the dental professional every nine stages “a batch” beginning january 1 2011 we were able to reliably estimate the number of batches which are expected to be shipped for each case based upon our historical experience the amounts allocated to this deliverable are 

recognized on a prorated basis as each batch is shipped prior to january 1 2011 revenue was deferred upon the first batch shipment and was recognized upon the final batch shipment the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year and revenue is recognized ratably as each shipment occurs in the first quarter of 2013 we will begin to consolidate vivera retainer product shipments down to one shipment per year compared to the current process of four shipments per year 

prior to january 1 2011 we used vsoe as fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement and replacement aligner deliverables we deferred the fair value of case refinement and replacement aligner deliverables based on estimated usage rates and recognized the residual revenue upon initial batch shipment the deferred revenue was subsequently recognized as the refinement and replacement aligners were shipped 

scanners and cadcam services 

we recognize revenues from the sales of itero and ioc intraoral scanners and cadcam services cadcam services include scanning services extended warranty for the intraoral scanners a range of itero restorative services and orthocad services such as orthocad icast orthocad iq and orthocad irecord we sell intraoral scanners and services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and for additional fees the customer may select an unlimited scanning service agreement over a fixed period of time or extended warranty periods revenue net of related discounts and allowances is recognized when products or equipment have been shipped installed and onsite training completed when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured title and risk of loss has passed to customers based on the shipping terms no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts returns and customer incentives can be reliably estimated discounts are deducted from revenue at the time of sale or when the discount is offered whichever is later and free cases or training is included as a deliverable in the multipleelement arrangement assessment returns of products excluding warranty related returns are infrequent and insignificant 

services  service revenue including itero restorative and all orthocad services are recognized upon delivery or ratably over the contract term as the specified services are performed 

extended warranties  we offer customers an option to purchase extended warranties on certain products we recognize revenue on these extended warranty contracts ratably over the life of the contract the costs associated with these extended warranty contracts are recognized when incurred 

when intraoral scanners are sold with either an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenue based on each elements relative selling price we estimate the selling price of each element as if it is sold on a standalone basis taking into consideration historical prices as well as our pricing and discounting strategies we will continue to review our estimates as we continue to integrate cadent into our business 

revenues for unlimited scanning service agreements and extended warranty are recognized ratably over the service periods if a customer selects a pay per use basis for scanning service fees the revenue is recognized as the service is provided 

for direct sales and sales to certain distributors intraoral scanner revenue is recognized once the intraoral scanner has been installed and onsite training is completed for other distributors who provide installation and training to the customer we recognize scanner revenue when the intraoral scanner is shipped to the distributor assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation and monte carlo simulation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term and stock price volatility in addition judgment is required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

goodwill and finitelived acquired intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the reporting units based on relative synergies generated 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of the cadent acquisition these assets are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives of one to fifteen years reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

impairment of goodwill finitelived acquired intangible assets and longlived assets 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit are based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition the impairment test for goodwill is a twostep process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the income approach of the reporting units as well as various price or market multiples applied to the reporting units operating results along with the appropriate control premium under the marketing approach both of which are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in note 2 in our consolidated financial statements if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 

interim testing 

we test our goodwill balances for impairment annually on november 30th or more frequently if indicators are present or circumstances change that suggest an impairment may exist during the third quarter of 2012 we determined that the goodwill for our sccs reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual impairment tests since an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our sccs reporting unit below its carrying amount these indicators included the termination of an exclusive distribution arrangement with straumann for itero intraoral scanners in europe as well as the termination of their nonexclusive distribution arrangement for itero intraoral scanners in north america together with market conditions and business trends within the sccs reporting unit while we continue to expect revenue growth in our sccs business our expectations for future growth and profitability rates projected for the sccs reporting unit are lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by overall lower than expected financial results 

as a result we performed step one analysis for our sccs reporting unit which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the sccs reporting unit against its carrying amount including the goodwill allocated to it in deriving the fair value of the sccs reporting unit we utilized a combination of both the income and market approach which are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy the income approach provides an estimate of fair value based on discounted expected future cash flows the market approach provides an estimate of fair value using various prices or market multiples applied to the reporting units operating results and then applies an appropriate control premium in order to reconcile to our market capitalization as a result of our step one analysis we concluded that the fair value of the sccs reporting unit was less than its carrying value therefore we proceeded to perform step two of the goodwill impairment analysis 

step two of the goodwill impairment analysis measures the impairment charge by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination this allocation process was performed only for the purposes of measuring the goodwill impairment and not to adjust the carrying values of the recognized tangible assets and liabilities any excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss based on our analysis the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of the goodwill for the sccs reporting unit we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of 2012 of 247 million  and an additional 119 million  during the fourth quarter of 2012 representing a change in estimate upon finalizing our 2013 annual budget process for a total impairment charge of 366 million  none of the goodwill impairment charge was deductible for tax purposes 

annual impairment test 

in addition to our interim goodwill testing for our sccs reporting unit we also performed our annual goodwill impairment test for both our reporting units clear aligner and sccs on november 30th in accordance with our accounting policy in step one we compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the estimated fair value as determined by both the income and market approaches for our clear aligner reporting unit we determined that the estimated fair value significantly exceeded its carrying value and therefore was not at risk for impairment 

for our sccs reporting unit we concluded that the carrying value of this reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value therefore we proceeded to step two of the goodwill impairment analysis as a result we performed step two of the goodwill impairment analysis to quantify the amount of impairment if any based on our analysis as of november 30 2012 in this step the estimated fair value of the entire sccs reporting unit was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities in a hypothetical analysis that calculated the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination the allocation process was performed only for purposes of measuring the goodwill impairment and not to adjust the carrying values of recognized tangible assets or liabilities accordingly we did not record any impairment charge under our step two analysis as the implied fair value of the allocated goodwill exceeded the carrying value as of november 30 2012 by approximately 10  a change in any one of the key assumptions as described below would result in an additional impairment 

 

 

 

in conjunction with our goodwill impairment test we tested for recoverability of the sccs asset group including the carrying value of the intangible assets and concluded the asset group including the intangible assets was not impaired as determined by the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group under the longlived asset impairment guidance as such no writedown of the intangible assets were recorded as of november 30th or during 2012 

although no impairment existed for the intangible assets because the carrying value of intangible assets included in step one of the goodwill impairment test are significantly higher than the hypothetical fair value of the reporting units intangible assets used in step two of the goodwill impairment test the sccs reporting unit will continue to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test we have determined that for the foreseeable reporting periods the sccs reporting unit will continue to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test but may pass step two 

in fiscal years 2011 and 2010 we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter for our reporting units and found no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units was significantly in excess of the carrying value 

finitelived intangible assets and longlived assets 

we evaluate longlived assets including finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value there were no asset impairments during 2012 2011 or 2010 

accounting for income taxes 

we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 

we account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution 

of any related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of estimates to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 

we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable the available positive evidence at december 31 2012 included historical operating profits and a projection of future income sufficient to realize most of our remaining deferred tax assets as of december 31 2012 it was considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain foreign loss carryovers as we are unable to forecast sufficient future profits to realize the deferred tax assets 

accounting guidance for stockbased compensation prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled 230 million as of december 31 2012 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable we follow the tax law ordering method to determine when excess tax benefits have been realized and consider only the direct impacts of awards when calculating the amount of windfalls or shortfalls 

us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided for on a cumulative total of 1092 million  of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of the end of the year ended december 31 2012 we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credit and foreign withholding taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 497 million  invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2012  and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 

currency rate risk 

we operate in north america europe asiapacific costa rica and israel  as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the 

future we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except as noted below there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended december 31 2012 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2012 management made the following changes to its internal controls over financial reporting to remediate the material weakness as of december 31 2012 

 

 

management tested the newly implemented controls and procedures found them to be effective and have concluded as of december 31 2012 this material weakness has been remediated 

with regard to our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 and the first three quarters of 2012 management performed a review of all journal entries posted in fiscal 2011 and 2012 by these specific finance individuals and confirmed that all posted journal entries were authorized and appropriate as a result of our review we have concluded that the noted material weakness had no impact on our 2011 and 2012 financial statements therefore our consolidated financial 

statements fairly present in all material respects the financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented

clear aligner segment 

malocclusion and traditional orthodontic treatment 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting nearly a billion people or approximately 50 to 75 of the population of major developed countries approximately 68 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 26 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign treatment—our served market 

in the united states “us” orthodontists and gps treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets referred to as braces and augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices as needed options available to attempt to improve treatment aesthetics include using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bonding brackets on the inside or lingual surface of the patient’s teeth the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement known in the industry as “chair time” including the initial diagnosis creation of an appropriate treatment plan and bonding of the brackets to the patient’s teeth and attachment of arch wires to the brackets subsequent visits involve tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks until the final visit when the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient’s teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

the invisalign system 

the invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable orthodontic aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  the dental professional prepares and sends us a patient’s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition the dental professional can also submit an intraoral scan or “digital impression” through an itero or ioc intraoral scanner instead of a physical pvs impression 

preparation of 3d computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition using computed tomography known as ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition in cases where the dental professional submits a digital impression this step in the process is eliminated 

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck software  we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan the clincheck plan simulates appropriate tooth movement broken down into a series of twoweek increments and details timing and placement of any attachments that will be used during treatment attachments are toothcolored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment  upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography 

  

technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional  from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck animation aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment plan after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage throughout treatment the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements per the doctor’s original prescription and resulting clincheck treatment plan 

retention  upon completion of the treatment the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product vivera retainers are shipped every three months over a one year period 

scanners and cadcam services segment 

although advancements have been made in materials used for taking dental impressions since their introduction one hundred years ago the overall impression process has remained relatively unchanged shortcomings such as voids pulls and the general margin for error have remained inherent in conventional impressions and subsequent retakes create unnecessary cost increase for a clinical practice intraoral scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry by enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3d image of the patient’s teeth using a handheld intraoral scanner inside the mouth intraoral scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients compared to the mess discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions the digital model created with an intraoral scanner is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration “remakes” so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments which results in greater overall patient satisfaction 

as the only intraoral scanner system in the market based on parallel confocal imaging the itero and ioc intraoral scanners utilize laser and optical scanning to capture the contours of the patient’s dentition gingival structures and the bite the intraoral scanners capture 100000 points of laser light in perfect focus without the use of powder to coat the teeth allowing for contact of the wand and tooth the benefit of contact scanning for the clinician is it eliminates the challenge of hovering over the teeth at a specific distance which can be complicated for the patient they enjoy a more comfortable powder free experience which allows the clinician to provide a very comfortable patient centric experience within minutes an accurate 3d digital impression can be viewed on the screen the 3d digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers inlays onlays crowns bridges and implant abutments invisalign digital impression submission digital records storage orthodontic diagnosis and computer aided placement of traditional braces and orthodontic retainers and appliances 

both itero and ioc intraoral scanners consist of a mobile computer unit display screen a control foot pedal and scanning wand to scan and capture a patient’s dentition full or partial dental arch system software features include occlusal map eraser tool edge trim tool realtime modeling and an option to submit scans for invisalign treatment the systems provide doctors and labs with an open choice to export generic digital files of their digital impression to use with other third party dental service providers this allows the digital impression to integrate with cone beam ct images for implant and orthodontic treatment planning orthocad services are additional services available with our ioc scanner or itero dual scanner inoffice training on the system and features is provided after the unit is delivered to the practice

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign treatment as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by focusing on the following key strategic initiatives 

 

  

  

  

 manufacturing and suppliers 

our manufacturing facilities are located in juarez mexico where we produce our aligners and manufacture itero restorative cases and in or yehuda israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand the final assembly of our ioc and itero scanners is performed by a third party manufacturer located in israel our digital planning of the invisalign system and interpretation for itero restorative cases are conducted primarily at our facility located in san jose costa rica in addition our cadcam services and intraoral scanner distribution and repair are currently conducted in our facility in new jersey  r efer to item 7 of this annual report on form 10k under “consolidation of new jersey operations” for a discussion on our plans to consolidate operations into our existing facilities by the third quarter of 2012 and close our new jersey facility in september 2011 to meet the increased demands from expected volumes we purchased a manufacturing facility in juarez mexico adding approximately 150000 square feet of facility space we are currently transitioning our aligner fabrication and intraoral scanner–related activities from our existing facility in juarez mexico into this new facility and expect to exit our existing facility once this transition is complete information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

our quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the fda and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the 

  

effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success in order to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we will continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continuously upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica in addition to improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our operations we will continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials for our aligners as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source the need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs see item 1a risk factors — “we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases” 

sales and marketing 

our sales efforts are focused primarily on the invisalign system and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and gps worldwide in north america our direct sales organization consists of approximately 200 people which includes quota carrying sales representatives sales management and sales administration internationally we have approximately 60 people engaged in sales and sales support for the invisalign system we have three distribution partners that sell the invisalign system in smaller noncore country markets in the asia pacific emea and latin america regions as our international business grows we will evaluate adding distribution partners in other noncore country markets on a casebycase basis for our intraoral scanners we have approximately 25 direct sales representatives in north america our smaller intraoral scanner sales team also leverages leads generated by our invisalign sales and marketing resources including customer events and industry tradeshows we also have distribution partners that sell our itero intraoral scanner straumann is our exclusive distribution partner for itero scanners in europe 

we market invisalign by communicating the benefits of the invisalign system to dental professionals through our training programs online and traditional mail campaigns trade shows trade journals and print we also promote the benefits of invisalign through our integrated consumer marketing platform which combines traditional print and broadcast media with a balanced mix of public relations event marketing and social media the goal of this platform is to raise awareness of invisalign and invisalign teen as the best options for a healthy beautiful smile among adults and teenagers in addition our consumer marketing platform enables us to help prospective patients find a great invisalign treatment practice that can meet their needs for intraoral scanners in addition to leveraging invisalign customer events and industry tradeshows to communicate the benefits of digital scanning to dental professionals we also have training programs educational websites and limited print advertising 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps we have more than 31300 active invisalign providers and more than 2100 intraoral scanner users worldwide 

  

research and development 

we are committed to investing in worldclass technology development which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans our research and development expenses were 372 million for 2011 260 million for 2010 and 223 million for 2009 

our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms our research and development activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing research studies as well as making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2011 we had 256 issued us patents 132 pending us patent applications and 176 foreign issued patents as well as 155 pending foreign patent applications 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

general economic conditions impact our business and financial results and we experience seasonal trends related to differences between our two customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve for example european sales of invisalign treatment are often weaker in the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday in north america summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year however many gps are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases although we have only recently acquired our intraoral scanner business capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter consequently these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the nature of invisalign treatment which is prescribed by a doctor and therefore no two cases are alike we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which treatment data or “a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to 

  

manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our invisalign backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future invisalign sales our quarterly invisalign revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter we define our intraoral scanner backlog as orders where payment is secured credit and financing is approved but the scanner has not yet shipped our intraoral scanner backlog as of december 31 2011 was not material 

competition 

we operate in a highly competitive market and we encounter a wide variety of competitors including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales marketing research and financial capabilities we also face competition from early stage companies although the number of competitors varies by segment currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the us including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc and dentsply international inc information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

key competitive factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

we believe we are in compliance with all fda federal and state laws and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products and manufacturing operations 

us 

us food and drug administration  in the us we must comply with applicable fda quality system dental and medical device regulations identified in the code of federal regulations cfr our invisalign products and intraoral scanners are classified as class ii medical devices the invisalign system has received premarket clearance from the fda pursuant to the 510k premarket notification procedure allowing us to 

  

market the invisalign family of products in the us our intraoral scanners are 510k exempt with special controls which allows us to market this product in the us without submitting a 510k premarket notification we are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state of california food and drug branch fdb for compliance with quality system regulations we maintain applicable city state and federal licenses and registrations for each of our facilities 

in november 2010 we received and responded to a warning letter from the fda which requested additional documentation relating to our written implemented corrective actions to our complaint and medical device reporting procedures in december 2011 the fda performed a followup inspection and in february 2012 we received a notice that all matters were addressed and the warning letter was considered closed if the fda determines that we do not comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market our products andor criminal prosecution 

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996  under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of patient health information confidentiality and security of patient medical records and the circumstances under which these records may be used and released by healthcare professionals and their business associates are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and the security standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and the security standard governs the technical physical and administrative safe guards used to ensure the availability of patient records and to protect the unauthorized release or disclosure of patient information the privacy and security standards apply to healthcare providers health insurance plans and healthcare clearinghouses referred to as “covered entities” as well as business associates who perform services for covered entities and have access to protected patient information we believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements 

other federal and state laws  as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business we are a medical device manufacturer subject to fda regulations these regulations among other things require that we maintain device and facilities registrations and listings as well as promote our products consistent with our fda 510k clearances furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions under the federal antikickback statutes prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws which are evolving at the federal and state levels are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions furthermore various state laws require us to report payments and other transfers of value made to dental professionals and teaching hospitals to state regulatory bodies

 item 1a risk factors tableend we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign treatment for any reason a continued weakness in general economic conditions or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect revenues gross margin and net profits 

we expect that revenues from the sale of the invisalign system will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed 

demand for our products may not increase as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the us economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts reduced the patient traffic in dentists’ offices reduction in consumer spending on higher value procedures or a reduction in the demand for dental services generally each of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results continued weakness in the global economy results in a challenging environment for selling dental technologies and dentists may postpone investments in capital equipment such as intraoral scanners in addition invisalign treatment which currently accounts for the vast majority of our revenues represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and customers and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign treatment as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign treatment is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance of all of our products will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics and price compared to competing products 

the frequency of use of the invisalign system by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of the invisalign system by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products 

in response to challenges in our business including increased competition we have in the past reduced the list price of our products we also provide volume based discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs expand our discount programs in the future if participation in these programs increases if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue or if sales by our distributors grows at a faster pace than our direct sales our average selling price would be adversely affected and our revenues gross margin and net profits losses may be reduced furthermore although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using 

  

exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to capacity constraints at our existing facilities 

we are subject to growthrelated risks including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects in addition in order to meet the demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion we opened a new manufacturing facility in juarez mexico at the end of 2011 we plan to transition aligner fabrication from our current facilities into this new facility during 2012 we also plan on transitioning our scanner distribution repair and cadcam services from our new jersey facility to this facility in juarez mexico by the third quarter of 2012 our ability to plan construct and equip additional manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a new manufacturing facility such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if the transition into this new facility is significantly delayed or demand for our product exceeds our current expectations we may not be able to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions our manufacturing capacity may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements any or all of these problems could result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise harm our business and financial results 

we may experience unexpected problems and expenses associated with the consolidation of our new jersey operations with existing manufacturing and shared services organizations 

in september 2011 we announced plans to consolidate our cadcam services and intraoral scannerrelated activities based in carlstadt new jersey with our existing manufacturing and shared services organizations we expect this consolidation to be completed by the third quarter of 2012 this consolidation is accompanied by a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our results of operations and statement of cash flows including 

 

  

   

  

 if any of these risks materialize in the future our operating results statement of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our recent acquisition of cadent holdings inc which may have an adverse effect on our business 

we acquired cadent holdings inc in april 2011 we acquired cadent for their people their technology and their existing revenue streams such as orthocad iq orthocad irecord and orthocad icast in addition to their intraoral scanning technology this acquisition is expected to strengthen our ability to drive adoption of the invisalign system by integrating invisalign treatment more fully with mainstream tools and procedures in doctors’ practices in addition we believe that the combination of the two companies will help accelerate the use of intraoral scanning in the dental industry by leveraging align’s global sales reach extensive professional and consumer marketing capabilities and large customer base we may however experience difficulties in achieving the anticipated financial or strategic benefits of this acquisition potential risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business with our existing business our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our revenues while controlling our expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product or software the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to accurately predict customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and produce enhancements we may incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is 

  

unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient with the invisalign system since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration “fda” and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products to our customers if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our revenues and operating profits could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our san jose california facility we also carry out research and development at locations in san jose costa rica and moscow russia in addition our customercare accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in costa rica with the acquisition of cadent in april 2011 we now also have operations in israel where the design and wand assembly intraoral scanner manufacturing and digital modeling of our intraoral scanners occurs our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

training production technicians takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to deliver our products within the timeframe our customers expect such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the markets for our products is intense and we expect aggressive competition from existing competitors and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various companies both within and outside the united states many of these manufacturers including danaher corporation 3m sirona dental systems inc and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their use of our products any of which could have a material adverse effect on our 

  

revenues volume growth net profit losses and stock price we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth our information systems and applications require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were to be found to be inaccurate or unreliable if we fail to properly maintain our information systems and data integrity or if we fail to develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner we could have operational disruptions have customer disputes lose our ability to produce timely and accurate reports have regulatory or other legal problems have increases in operating and administrative expenses lose existing customers have difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies or suffer other adverse consequences in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations revenues and operating results 

we are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

additionally we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the clincheck and myaligntech software and the invisalign doctor site software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

furthermore our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks because of the confidential health information we store and transmit security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action litigation possible liability and loss our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by among other things loss of customers and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 

there can be no assurance that our process of improving existing systems developing new systems to support our expanding operations integrating new systems protecting confidential patient information and 

  

improving service levels will not be delayed or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future failure to adequately protect and maintain the integrity of our information systems and data may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2011 we had issued 256 us patents 132 pending us patent applications and 176 issued foreign patents and 155 pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

  

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k a report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate in addition cadent was a private company and has not been subject to periodic reporting as a public company there can be no assurance that the cadent system of internal control over financial reporting would meet the standards required for public companies establishing testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance staff may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments and would increase our costs of doing business we have excluded them from the scope of our annual report on internal controls over financial reporting for the period ended december 31 2011 if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually the valuations used to determine the fair values used to test goodwill or amortizable intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates net sales growth discount rates earnings multiples and future cash flows are critical assumptions used to determine these fair values slower net sales growth rates in the dental industry an increase in discount rates unfavorable changes in earnings multiples or a decline in future cash flows among other factors may cause a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales training and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be 

  

materially harmed in addition our ability to recognize revenue on the direct sales of our intraoral scanners depends in part upon our ability to schedule and staff trainings the loss of the services provided by these individuals or our ability to timely hire such personnel in sufficient numbers based on our volume growth may harm our business if we are unable to retain our trainers or replace such individuals with persons having equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise in newly hired personnel or accurately predict the number of such personnel needed our revenues could be materially harmed 

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials as well as the optics electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our ct scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our scanners are provided by single suppliers we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners from a single source if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply and could face production interruptions delays and inefficiencies in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth conversely in order to secure supplies for production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our profitability may suffer in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we depend on a single contract manufacturer and supplier of parts used in our ioc and itero scanners and any disruption in this relationship may cause us to fail to meet the demands of our customers and damage our customer relationships 

we rely on a third party manufacturer in israel to assemble our ioc and itero scanners as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our 

  

products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible and could result in a significant interruption in the supply of our intraoral scanning products any failure by our contract manufacturer that results in delays in our fulfillment of customer orders may cause us to lose revenues and suffer damage to our customer relationships 

we primarily rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues primarily depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets as of december 31 2011 our north american sales organization consisted of approximately 200 people internationally we had approximately 60 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2011 we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our revenues may be harmed 

if our distributor relationships are not successful our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected 

we depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in various geographic regions and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years congress recently passed health care reform legislation that president obama signed into law in march 2010 the enacted legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 each medical device manufacturer may have to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 percent of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices this tax applies to all medical devices including our products these taxes will result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in 

  

delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 

  

  

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

outside of north america we currently sell our products in europe asia pacific latin america and the middle east and may expand into other countries from time to time for sales of our products outside the us we are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a securities class action suit was filed against us on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased our common stock between january 30 2007 and october 24 2007 while we believe the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves we could incur substantial legal fees and our management’s attention and resources may be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

 

  

  

 if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid shortterm fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in an current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

  

we have adopted a shareholders rights’ plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders to date our board of directors has designated 200000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of align or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights’ plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of the tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 under these incentives all of the income we earn in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2011 as a result of these incentives income taxes were reduced by 154 million in 2011 in order to receive the benefit of the incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

align technology inc is a global medical device company that pioneered the invisible orthodontics market with the introduction of the invisalign system in 1999 today we are focused on designing manufacturing and marketing innovative technologyrich products to help dental professionals achieve the clinical results they expect and deliver effective convenient cuttingedge dental treatment options to their patients align technology was founded in march 1997 and is headquartered in san jose california with offices worldwide our international headquarters are located in amsterdam the netherlands we have two operating segments 1 clear aligner known as the invisalign system and 2 scanners and cadcam services known as itero and ioc intraoral scanners and orthocad services 

we received fda clearance in 1998 and began our first commercial sales of invisalign to us orthodontists in 1999 in 2000 we launched our first us national consumer advertising campaign and a year later introduced invisalign to the european market launching the first phase of international expansion in 2002 invisalign was made available to gps and in mid2003 leading dental schools began adding invisalign to their curriculum over the next several years we introduced several new products including invisalign express 10 invisalign teen invisalign assist and vivera retainers launched invisalign in japan and added three distribution partners for smaller noncore country markets in the asia pacific emea and latin america regions by 2011 we had launched invisalign g3 and invisalign g4 which includes significant new aligner and software features across all invisalign products that make it easier for doctors to use invisalign on more complex cases and launched invisalign in the people’s republic of china 

in 2011 we acquired cadent holdings inc a leading provider of 3d digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry and makers of the itero and ioc intraoral scanners and orthocad services we believe that the combination of align’s and cadent’s technologies and capabilities creates greater growth opportunities for align by bringing innovative new invisalign treatment tools to customers and by extending the value of intraoral scanning in dental practices intraoral scanners provide a dental “chairside” platform for accessing valuable digital diagnosis and treatment tools with potential for enhancing accuracy of records treatment efficiency and the overall patient experience we believe there are numerous benefits for customers and the opportunity to accelerate the adoption of invisalign through interoperability with our intraoral scanners the use of digital technologies such as cadcam for restorative dentistry or inoffice restorations has been growing rapidly and intraoral scanning is a critical part of enabling these new digital technologies and procedures in dental practices 

our business has grown over the past five years driven by numerous product introductions expansion of our international markets penetration into the teenager segment and by evolving consumer demand programs while increasing operational efficiencies between fiscal year 2007 and 2011 north american revenues increased from approximately 2248 million to approximately 3393 while international revenues have increased from 466 million to 1156 million for fiscal 2011 revenues increased 24 year over year driven by invisalign adoption by all customer channels and geographies despite continuing challenges in the global economy as well as the introduction of sales of itero and ioc intraoral scanners and orthocad services 

the invisalign system is offered in more than 45 countries and has been used to treat more than 17 million patients our itero and ioc intraoral scanners are available in over 25 countries and provide dental professionals with an open choice to send digital impressions to any laboratorybased cadcam system or to any of the more than 1800 dental labs worldwide 

  

our goal is to establish the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3d digital scans ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals we intend to achieve this by focusing on the following key strategic initiatives 

product innovation and clinical effectiveness  we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future longterm goal to drive and sustain product adoption which includes introducing new products along with significant evolution in features and functionality 

in the past four years we have announced new invisalign products and significant feature enhancements that make it easier for doctors to use invisalign on more patients for example invisalign teen launched in 2008 addresses the larger teenage segment most commonly treated by orthodontists in addition new features and enhancements introduced with invisalign g3 and invisalign g4 are engineered to address some of the most significant treatment challenges doctors encounter through the acquisition of cadent we now have a leading intraoral scanner which provides unique chairside digital tools for a range of procedures including invisalign digital case submission following the acquisition we announced invisalign interoperability on the ioc and itero intraoral scanners which enable our customers to better integrate their technologies and invisalign treatment process while enhancing the patient experience through digital scanning instead of taking traditional pvs impressions we also launched new and enhanced software features for the ioc and itero intraoral scanners which include improved digital workflows for both the straumann ® and biomet 3i ® fixture level implant integrations with new detailed implant prescription options finally the new itero dual scanner launched in january 2012 allows multiplespecialty practices to utilize one intraoral scanner to service all their scanning needs including crown and bridge implants and orthodontic treatment an upgrade is also available for existing itero customers who would like to add ioc orthodontic software functionality to their scanner 

we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase adoption and frequency of use however we expect that adoption of these new products will increase gradually over a number of years during 2012 we plan to continue to invest in product and technology development and will continue to introduce feature enhancements across our products as well as introduce chairside applications 

enhancing the customer experience we are committed to enhancing the customer experience through the evolution of our customer facing systems and programs making it easier for our customers to adopt our products into their practice and increase utilization 

we provide robust clinical education resources and training programs through instructorled training classes seminars and workshops as well as online training through webinars blogs and online educational websites such as our aligntech institute wwwaligntechinstitutecom and cadent wwwcadentinccom websites our customer support teams consist of over 700 treatment technicians and customer support staff available to help our customers with their cases and treatment plans our sales representatives provide additional support and practice development tools such as staff training software tips and tools practice marketing guides and marketing materials as well as any assistance with the invisalign or iteroioc system process lastly we offer our customers varying product promotional discounts and incentive programs as a means to improve the customer experience and increase utilization our largest north american program the advantage rebate program allows eligible orthodontist and gps to earn volume rebates and marketing benefits for exceeding quarterly case shipment thresholds and participating in continuing education additional tiered benefits range from practice development materials marketing consulting and access to dedicated clinical technicians 

during 2012 we plan to continue providing our high standard educational resources and improving our customer support processes as we centralize our newly acquired intraoral scannerrelated customer support team 

increasing the effectiveness of our consumer demand creation and extending invisalign brand awareness as an established and known brand within the dental industry efficiently marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving longterm growth 

  

our market research indicates that the majority of adults with malocclusion forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort in addition many parents also elect traditional treatment for their teenagers due to limited awareness of invisalign treatment applicability for teenager use our goals are to extend our leadership in clear aligner therapy with adults increase awareness and consumer demand with moms and teens and to continue expansion of the clear aligner category overall we continue to be successful with programs that more effectively and efficiently generate demand or “pull” for invisalign treatment in the past several years we continued building awareness and demand through an integrated consumer marketing platform of traditional media event marketing and digital and social media in addition we continued to evolve our marketing program aimed specifically at the teenage segment to increase awareness and educate prospective teen patients and their parents in 2011 we leveraged online and mobile widgets social media and blogs directly targeted to teens and launched a commercial prompting parents and teens to learn more about invisalign treatment we will continue to build on these programs and efforts in 2012 

growth of international markets  we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of our products by dental professionals in our core european markets as well as expansion into new markets 

in the past five years we have grown our core direct business in europe and japan from 466 million in 2007 to 1156 million in 2011 at the end of 2011 international sales represented approximately 241 of net worldwide revenues we trained over 17800 doctors on the invisalign system internationally predominantly orthodontists in europe which is our primary international market due to the higher number of complex malocclusion cases in international markets compared to north america product expansion and enhancements are important to providing doctors with treatment options that address a wider range of potential patient needs with greater treatment flexibility the recent invisalign g3 and invisalign g4 features designed to address those complex treatment issues is a significant product evolution 

we are also expanding our market presence globally in may 2011 we announced commercial availability of the invisalign system in china while we do not expect meaningful revenue from china for several years our focused strategy to launch invisalign in four major cities of china such as shanghai beijing shenzhen and guangzhou provides us a large growth opportunity long term additionally although the vast majority of our international revenues are from direct sales approximately 13 of our international invisalign sales in fiscal 2011 are from distribution partners covering noncore country markets in the asia pacific emea and latin america regions in early 2011 the invisalign system was commercially launched in turkey through our emea distribution partner in december 2011 we received regulatory approval for the invisalign system in russia and commercial launch of invisalign in russia and the middle east began in 2012 also through our emea distribution partner with these efforts we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future 

in addition to the successful execution of our business strategy there are a number of other factors which may affect our results in 2012 and beyond as set forth below 

 

    

  

  

  

  

  

 the consolidation of our new jersey operations includes a total reduction of 119 full time headcount in carlstadt new jersey the transition began in the fourth quarter of 2011 and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2012 as part of this consolidation we will incur costs for severance estimated to be approximately 20 million of which approximately 11 million was realized in 2011 and 09 million over the first three quarters of 2012 after the new jersey consolidation is complete we expect to realize annualized net savings of approximately 40 million per year see part ii item 1a— “risk factors” for risks related to the consolidation of new jersey operations” 

  

  

 

 total utilization in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased slightly to 41 cases per doctor driven mostly by our north american gp customers and international doctors utilization among our north american orthodontist customers declined slightly from the third quarter of 2011 to 70 cases per doctor reflecting seasonality in their teenage patient case starts although we expect that over the longterm our utilization rates will gradually improve we expect that period over period comparisons of our utilization rates will fluctuate

  invisalign case volume by channel and product 

case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by channel and product for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 are as follows in thousands 

 

 fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 

total net revenues increased 926 million in 2011 as a result of worldwide volume growth across all customer channels and the inclusion of our scanner and cadcam services segment 

geographically both north america and international revenue increased by 1023 million due to an 186 growth in case volume favorable foreign exchange rates and the inclusion of eight months of scanner and cadcam service revenues invisalign case volume growth was driven by both improved utilization and an increase in the number of doctors submitting cases 

revenue from our clear aligner segment consisting of our invisalign products increased by 167 as a result of additional case volumes across all products the most significant volume percentage increases were in the invisalign teen and assist products although invisalign teen case volume increased 324 revenue for invisalign teen was comparable to the prior year primarily because of the 143 million release of deferred revenue in 2010 invisalign assist revenue growth was comprised of both an increase in case volume and additional revenue being recognized as each batch is shipped over the course of treatment instead of deferring until the final batch shipment additionally invisalign noncase revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were higher in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased sales of our vivera product 

since date of the acquisition until the end of the 2011 fiscal year end the scanner and cadcam services segment generated 281 million of revenue from sales of itero and ioc scanners and orthocad services 

  

fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 

total net revenues increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of worldwide volume growth across all customer channels the release of revenue previously deferred for invisalign teen replacement aligners in the second quarter of 2010 contributed an additional 143 million to total net revenues for 2010 

in 2010 north america revenue increased 176 compared to 2009 due to overall case volume growth of 152 as well as an increase in our average selling price higher case volume was driven primarily by the north american orthodontic channel reflecting increased penetration into the teenage orthodontic market especially with the invisalign teen product additionally the increase also reflects a significant reduction in our revenue deferral rate for teen replacement aligners and lower discounts and rebates 

our international invisalign revenue increased 251 in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to 295 growth in case volumes across all products partially offset by a mix shift towards our lower priced products as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

invisalign teen includes up to six replacement aligners which may be ordered at any time throughout treatment through the second quarter of 2010 revenue for these replacement aligners was deferred based on 100 percent of the fair value of the aligners until the replacement aligners were used or the case completed since the launch of invisalign teen in 2008 we evaluated the usage experience of the replacement aligners and determined that there is sufficient historical experience to establish an estimated usage rate as a result in june 2010 we reduced deferred revenue for invisalign teen replacement aligners by 143 million to reflect the lower estimated usage for inprocess cases 

invisalign noncase revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increased sales of our vivera and retainer products

gross margin decreased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the acquisition of our scanner and cadcam services segment from cadent which carries a lower margin at approximately 235 compared to 785 for our clear aligner segment compared to 2010 our 2011 clear aligner gross margin remained flat due to higher cost per case resulting from higher material costs which was partially offset by higher case volumes we also incurred amortization costs related to the acquired technology from cadent of approximately 07 million and exit costs related to the consolidation of our new jersey operations of approximately 08 million for the year ended december 31 2011 

gross margin improved in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the increase in case volume which resulted in higher cost absorption and reduced cost per case additionally the gross margin for 2010 was favorably impacted by the release of teen deferred revenue of 143 million during 2010 gross margin for 2010 and 2009 also included amortization of the ormco royalties of 08 million and 62 million respectively

on october 19 2010 we entered into a memorandum of understanding to resolve a complaint filed by dr leiszler as a result we recorded a total litigation settlement charge of 45 million in 2010 for settlement costs 

insurance settlement in millions 

 

 in june 2010 we received an 87 million insurance settlement over a disputed coverage under our general liability umbrella that was not previously reimbursed by our insurer related to the orthoclear litigation there were no insurance settlements in 2011 

amortization of acquired intangible assets in millions 

 

 amortization of acquired intangibles related to operating expense for 2011 was approximately 23 million which were related to trademarks and customer relationships that were acquired as part of the cadent acquisition in 2011 

interest and other income expense net in millions 

 

 interest and other income expense net include interest income earned on cash balances interest expense foreign currency translation gains and losses and other miscellaneous charges 

interest income and interest expense in 2011 was consistent with 2010 other income net increased in 2011 compared to 2010 by 04 million reflecting increase in foreign exchange gain during 2011 

interest income and interest expense in 2010 was consistent with 2009 other expense net increased in 2010 compared to 2009 by 09 million reflecting increases in foreign exchange losses during 2010 

  

provision for benefit from income taxes in millions 

 

 we recorded an income tax provision of 232 million for 2011 an income tax provision of 278 million for 2010 and an income tax benefit of 26 million for 2009 respectively these represented effective tax rates of 258 272 and 77 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our effective tax rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35 due to certain foreign earnings primarily from costa rica which are subject to a lower tax rate 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 431 million of undistributed earnings from nonus operations held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as permanently reinvested outside the us accordingly no additional us income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes have been provided thereon determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable 

we exercise significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth forecasted earnings and projected taxable income in determining the provision for income taxes and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future benefit from deferred tax assets 

our valuation allowance of approximately 202 million is mostly related to capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2011 because we cannot forecast sufficient future capital gains or foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets these net operating loss carryforwards will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 

the california 20092010 budget legislation included the ability to elect to apply a single sales factor apportionment for years beginning after january 1 2011 as a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor we remeasured our deferred taxes taking into account the expected california tax rate under the elective single sales factor we determined that by electing a single sales factor apportionment our deferred tax assets decreased by approximately 12 million net of federal benefit of the 12 million tax impact 06 million was recorded as a discrete item in 2009 and the remaining 06 million was recorded as a discrete item in 2010 

at december 31 2011 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 960 million which if not used will begin to expire in 2026 these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code § 382 but are expected to be fully realized furthermore we have california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 678 million which if not used will begin to expire in 2013 at december 31 2011 we had research credit carryforwards of approximately 50 million for federal purposes and 36 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire after 2020 the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 

financial accounting standard board “fasb” accounting standard codification “asc” 718 prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled 251 million as of december 31 2011 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales and the proceeds from the sale of our common stock as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we had the following cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in thousands 

 

 cash flows in thousands 

 

 as of december 31 2011 we had 2481 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments which include corporate bonds foreign bonds and agency bonds 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 665 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries we have not provided additional us income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately 431 million of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings that are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the us 396 million of the total undistributed foreign earnings relate to costa rica in the event such earnings are repatriated to the us the earnings would be subject to additional us income taxes reduced by any foreign taxes paid

 investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 2116 million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily consisted of our cash paid for the acquisition of cadent of approximately 1876 million and approximately 304 million of property plant and equipment purchases we also had restricted cash of approximately 40 million which primarily represents funds we hold as unclaimed merger consideration related to the acquisition of cadent on april 29 2011 these costs were partially offset by net maturities of marketable securities and the proceeds from the sale of equipment of approximately 104 million 

net cash used in investing activities was 159 million for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily consisted of approximately 364 million for purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment which was partially offset by net maturities of our marketable securities of 206 million although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 

net cash used in investing activities was 16 million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily consisted of approximately 72 million used for the purchase of property and equipment which were partially offset by 60 million of net maturities from marketable securities 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 272 million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily resulting from approximately 255 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately 114 million from excess tax provision from our sharebased arrangements these proceeds were partially offset by approximately 78 million common stock repurchases and 20 million of taxes paid for our employees’ vesting of restricted stock units 

net cash provided by financing activities was 147 million for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily resulting from approximately 118 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately 40 million from excess tax provision from our sharebased arrangements these proceeds were partially offset by approximately 10 million of taxes paid for our employees’ vesting of restricted stock units 

net cash provided by financing activities was 68 million for the year ended december 31 2009 which resulted primarily from 81 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock these proceeds were partially offset from the tax benefit excess of sharedbased payments and taxes paid on vesting restricted stock units of 11 million 

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting restricted stock units “rsus” which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercise as a result we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods in addition because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2011 2010 and 2009 we paid 19 million 11 million and 05 million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers respectively 

line of credit 

on december 14 2010 we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank under this revolving line of credit we have 300 million of available borrowings with a maturity date of 

  

december 31 2012 the interest rate on borrowings will range from libor plus 15 to 20 depending upon the amount of cash we maintain at comerica bank this credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of 100 million additionally in the event our unrestricted cash deposited is less than 550 million the unused facility fee will increase from 0050 per quarter to 0125 per quarter as of december 31 2011 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and are in compliance with the financial covenants 

stock repurchase 

on october 27 2011 we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to 1500 million of common stock purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market during the fourth quarter of 2011 we repurchased approximately 03 million shares of common stock at an average price of 2400 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 78 million including commissions as of december 31 2011 there remains 1422 million under our existing stock repurchase authorization 

investments to increase manufacturing capacity 

on august 4 2011 we purchased land and a manufacturing facility in juarez mexico for approximately 32 million in order to expand our current manufacturing capacity in order meet expected demand we expect to incur costs in 2012 as we continue to construct and equip this facility to operate at full capacity 

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 

 

 our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 155 million of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2011 we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

we executed an agreement on january 12 2012 to lease 47000 square feet of property in telaviv israel where we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand and have operations and general and administrative functions the monthly rent for this facility is approximately 67000 and will expire in january 2016 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2011 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation goodwill and finitelived assets and related impairment and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

in the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 we adopted the new accounting guidance for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements accounting standards update “asu” 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the financial accounting standard board “fasb” emerging issues task force  this new guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable replaces the term “fair value” in the revenue allocation with “selling price” to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entityspecific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant replaces the “residual method” of allocation with the “relative sellingprice method ” and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables applying this method including proportional allocation of any discounts to each deliverable 

multipleelement arrangements “meas” arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables including any combination of equipment services and extended warranties the deliverables included in the meas are separated into more than one unit of accounting when i the delivered equipment has value to the customer on a standalone basis and ii delivery of the undelivered service elements is probable and substantially in our control based on the new accounting guidance adopted january 1 2011 arrangement consideration is then allocated to each unit delivered or undelivered based on the relative selling price “rsp” of each unit of accounting based first on vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if it exists second on thirdparty evidence “tpe” if it exists and on estimated selling price “esp” if neither vsoe or tpe exist 

 

  

  

 we adopted these standards for applicable arrangements that were entered into or materially modified on or after january 1 2011 implementation of these standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in the period under report and is not expected to significantly affect the timing and pattern of revenue recognition in future periods 

  

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur we have not recorded any estimated losses for the periods presented provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

clear aligner 

we enter into arrangements “treatment plans” that involve multiple future product deliverables for example included in the price of invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist we offer optional case refinement which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient’s teeth to the desired final position case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment invisalign teen also includes six optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered at any time throughout treatment 

we use vsoe adjusted by estimated usage rates for case refinements and replacement aligners to determine the respective esp in the absence of vsoe we determine our best estimate of selling price as if it is sold on a standalone basis and take into consideration our pricing and discounting strategies market conditions as well as historical price we regularly review our vsoe and esp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and update of these estimates 

we determined that our treatment plans are comprised of four possible deliverables that represent separate units of accounting singlebatched aligners multiplebatched aligners case refinement and replacement aligners we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each unit’s relative selling price and recognize the revenue upon the delivery of each unit in the treatment plan 

the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized as each shipment occurs for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature in which aligners are shipped to the dental professional every nine stages “a batch” we determined that each batch has standalone value and therefore represents a separate unit of accounting the estimated selling price for invisalign assist with progress tracking is allocated according to the estimated number of batches 

prior to january 1 2011 we used vsoe as fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement and replacement aligner deliverables we deferred the fair value of case refinement and replacement aligner deliverables based on a breakage factor and recognized the residual revenue upon initial batch shipment the deferred revenue was subsequently recognized as the refinement and replacement aligners were shipped for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature we did not have independent evidence of fair value for the separate batches of aligners so all batches of aligners were considered a single unit of accounting prior to january 1 2011 for these treatment plans revenue was deferred upon the first batched shipment and recognized upon the final batched shipment 

scanners and cadcam services 

we recognize revenues from the sales of itero and ioc intraoral scanners and cadcam services cadcam services include scanning services extended warranty for the intraoral scanners a range of itero restorative services and orthocad services such as orthocad icast orthocad iq and orthocad irecord we sell intraoral scanners and services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners the intraoral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty and for additional fees the customer may select an unlimited scanning service agreement over a fixed period of time or extended warranty periods revenue net of related discounts and allowances is recognized when products or equipment have been shipped when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured title and risk of loss has passed to customers based on the shipping terms no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts returns and customer incentives can be reliably estimated 

  

discounts are deducted from revenue at the time of sale or when the discount is offered whichever is later and free cases or training is included as a deliverable in the multipleelement arrangement assessment returns of products excluding warranty related returns are infrequent and insignificant 

services service revenue including itero restorative and all orthocad services are recognized upon delivery or ratably over the contract term as the specified services are performed 

extended warranties we offer customers an option to purchase extended warranties on certain products we recognize revenue on these extended warranty contracts ratably over the life of the contract the costs associated with these extended warranty contracts are recognized when incurred 

when intraoral scanners are sold with either an unlimited scanning service agreement andor extended warranty we allocate revenue based on each element’s relative selling price we estimate the selling price of each element as if it is sold on a standalone basis taking into consideration historical prices as well as our pricing and discounting strategies we will continue to review our estimates as we continue to integrate cadent into our business 

revenues for unlimited scanning service agreements and extended warranty are recognized ratably over the service periods if a customer selects a pay per use basis for scanning service fees the revenue is recognized as the service is provided 

for direct sales and sales to certain distributors intraoral scanner revenue is recognized once the intraoral scanner has been installed and onsite training is completed for other distributors who provide installation and training to the customer we recognize scanner revenue when the intraoral scanner is shipped to the distributor assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation and monte carlo simulation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term and stock price volatility in addition judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

goodwill and finitelived purchased intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the reporting unit based on relative synergies generated 

our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of the cadent acquisition these assets are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives of one to fifteen years reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 

impairment of goodwill finitelived purchased intangible assets and longlived assets 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount the 

  

allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit are based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition the impairment test for goodwill is a twostep process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting units if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 

in fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter for our reporting units and found no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units was significantly in excess of the carrying value 

we evaluate longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a longlived asset may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate if an asset is considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value which is estimated based on projected discounted future net cash flows there were no asset impairments during 2011 2010 or 2009 

deferred tax valuation allowance 

we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2011 with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards we believe that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be realized however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 74 million invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2011 and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 

currency rate risk 

we operate in north america europe asiapacific costa rica israel and japan as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions the impact of an aggregate change of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

 item 1 business tableend our company 

align technology inc “we” “our” or “align” designs manufactures and markets the invisalign system a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces we received the united states food and drug administration “fda” clearance to market invisalign in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 

we distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist or gp in order to provide the invisalign treatment solution to their patients orthodontists and gps must initially complete an invisalign training course the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asia pacific latin america and japan we use a distributor model for the sale of our products in parts of the asia pacific latin american and smaller country markets in europe the middle east and africa regions 

we were incorporated in delaware in april 1997 our headquarters are currently located at 2560 orchard parkway san jose california 95131 and our telephone number is 4084701000 our international headquarters are located in amsterdam netherlands our digital planning and software facility is located in san jose costa rica and our aligner manufacturing facility is located in juarez mexico 

industry background 

malocclusion 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting approximately 50 to 75 of the population of major developed countries or nearly a billion individuals approximately 68 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 26 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign—our served 

  

market while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with traditional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek treatment 

traditional orthodontic treatment 

in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patient’s teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices 

the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient’s teeth with a bonding agent and attach an arch wire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient’s teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment in the us typically range between 3500 to 8000 with a median fee of approximately 5000 generally only a portion of the fee is reimbursed by insurance fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional’s estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time and reduced profitability for the dental professional 

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment 

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages traditional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment additionally teenagers that seek orthodontic treatment have traditionally only had the option of braces for treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an alternative orthodontic treatment that addresses these patient concerns 

the invisalign solution 

invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctorprescribed custom manufactured clear plastic removable orthodontic appliances aligners the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options specialized services and proprietary software for treatment visualization comprised of several phases the principal steps of the invisalign system are the creation of customized digital treatment plans using proprietary software known as clincheck software which occurs in our facility in san jose costa rica and the manufacturing of customized invisalign aligners which occurs in our facility in juarez mexico 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of prescription form a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches photographs of the patient and at the dental professional’s election xrays of the patient’s dentition the impression is a critical component of the invisalign system as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patient’s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models and subsequent molds and aligners an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patient’s teeth the prescription is also a critical component of the invisalign system describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our facility in juarez mexico 

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition using computed tomography known as ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional’s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facility in san jose costa rica 

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck software  in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulated treatment plan called a clincheck treatment plan is based on an internally developed and proprietary computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients this clincheck treatment plan is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon completion of the review the patient’s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site formally known as the virtual invisalign practice or vip our proprietary customer interfacing software portal which is available on our websites located at wwwinvisaligncom and wwwaligntechinstitutecom  the dental professional then reviews the clincheck treatment plan and can either accept the proposed treatment or request modifications and adjustments until satisfied with the treatment 

  

plan the clincheck animation allows the dental professional to view this threedimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly the clincheck treatment plan enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to view the treatment plan allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professional’s final approval of the proposed clincheck treatment plan engages us to manufacture the corresponding molds and aligners in juarez mexico 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment  upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck treatment plan we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment these molds are then used to fabricate the patient’s aligners 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional  from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck animation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed by dental professionals for an individual patient by using a clincheck treatment plan each aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment plan after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series advancing the teeth movement with each aligner stage this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete when treating with invisalign full invisalign express and invisalign teen aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment for invisalign assist when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with toothcolored attachments bonded to the patient’s teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement we provide an alignerlike template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s teeth where needed also in cases where interproximal reduction or ipr is required or requested by the dental professional we provide an ipr treatment form quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction location and timing of ipr 

retention  upon completion of the treatment the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product vivera retainers are shipped every three months over the one year period 

our products 

our revenues are generated from the sale of the following product offerings 

 

   

invisalign g3 in october of 2010 we launched invisalign g3 the most significant collection of new features and innovation in our company’s history touching virtually every system and product significant improvements and enhancements were made to all our customerfacing systems for instance the invisalign doctor site now consolidates all of a patient’s invisalign records and treatment tasks together in one location for easy access and the clincheck software now includes drag and drop features additional clinical tools and a more intuitive interface in addition with the exception of our vivera retainers we introduced new and expanded features across our product line engineered to deliver even better clinical results the new invisalign g3 aligner and software features make it easier to use invisalign with patients who have class ii and class iii malocclusion the new features include 

 

  

 invisalign g3 is currently available in north america and will be launched internationally in the second quarter of 2011 

invisalign full  invisalign full is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and will consist of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck treatment plan in order to achieve the doctor’s treatment goals for invisalign full aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 

invisalign express and invisalign lite invisalign express and invisalign lite are lowercost solutions for less complex orthodontic cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and includes noncomprehensive treatment relapse cases for minor crowding and spacing or as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers invisalign express uses up to 10 sets of aligners and is sold in the us and canada invisalign lite uses up to 14 sets of aligners and is sold to our international regions for invisalign expresslite aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 

invisalign teen invisalign teen is designed to meet the specific needs of the nonadult comprehensive or teen treatment market invisalign teen includes features such as compliance indicators to help gauge patient wear and compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address the natural eruption of key teeth common in teen patients predominantly marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients these features are intended to meet the treatment needs of those younger patients as part of invisalign teen we include up to six free individual replacement aligners during active treatment to cover potential aligner loss for invisalign teen aligners other than the replacement aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 

invisalign assist invisalign assist is designed specifically for gps who want more support in selecting monitoring and finishing invisalign cases intended to help newlytrained and lower volume gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice invisalign assist is intended to make it easier for gps to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach submit cases more efficiently and manage appointments with suggested tasks in addition progress tracking features allow gps to submit new impressions every nine stages when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages  

retention  in addition to our traditional single retainer product we offer vivera retainers where we deliver a new replacement retainer to orthodontic patients every three months for one year vivera retainers are produced using the same proprietary technology and material as the invisalign aligners and offer an effective aesthetic retention solution for both invisalign and noninvisalign patients 

  

training ancillary and other  the remaining net revenues are generated by training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 

proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck software and the invisalign doctor site are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue 

benefits of invisalign 

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to traditional braces 

benefits to the dental professional 

 

  

  

 benefits to the patient 

 

  

  

  

   

 we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of traditional braces or as an alternative more aesthetic treatment option for teenagers 

limitations of invisalign 

in some instances the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to traditional treatment aligners cost more to produce than traditional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in traditional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional and the treatment selected the cost of invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for traditional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there are a variety of factors that may impact when the corresponding aligners are delivered one of which includes the timing of when the dental professional accepts the case aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with traditional braces for optimal results in addition because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech in some instances patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have been reported we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 

our target market and patient base 

our market research indicates that the majority of adults with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces adults who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment will be more likely to seek treatment and therefore represent our most immediate market expansion opportunity with the launch of invisalign teen in july 2008 we now offer a product designed to meet the needs of the nonadult comprehensive or younger teen treatment market invisalign teen makes our treatment more applicable to an orthodontist’s patient base which we believe will provide us the opportunity to increase our penetration into and our share of the teen treatment market in addition many parents also elect traditional treatment for their children due to limited awareness of invisalign applicability for teenager use our goals are to extend our leadership in clear aligner therapy with adults increase awareness and consumer demand with moms and teens and to continue expansion of the clear aligner category overall by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers—adults parents and teens—we intend to increase the number of patients who seek treatment using invisalign 

approximately 68 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 26 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign—our served market twentyfive percent of these patients or approximately 614 thousand have mature dentition adults and older teens with fullyerupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth seventyfive percent or approximately 20 million have erupting dentition nonadult comprehensive or younger teens with partiallyerupted second molars cuspid and second bicuspid teeth as of december 31 2010 our share of the 26 million patients in our served market is approximately 66 

published market data for gps providing treatment for malocclusion is limited however as the primary care provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base we believe gps represent a significant market expansion opportunity 

  

as of december 31 2010 approximately 14 million patients cumulatively worldwide have started treatment using invisalign the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asia pacific latin america and japan international sales accounted for approximately 25 24 and 21 of our net revenues in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in note 17 “segments and geographical information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we operate as one reportable segment—the design development manufacturing and marketing of invisalign additionally no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total net revenues in 2010 2009 and 2008 

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the following key strategic initiatives 

 

  

  

  

 product innovation and clinical effectiveness  we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future longterm goal to drive and sustain invisalign adoption our primary channels—gps and orthodontists—each have distinct and separate needs specifically orthodontists want a more robust set of tools for greater predictability wider applicability across their patient base and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system on the other hand typical gps want greater ease of use more efficient and simplified diagnostic tools guidance through the case setup process minimal treatment intervention and selfhelp tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion the invisalign system offers a variety of treatment options and products to address both channel needs for example invisalign teen is predominately marketed to the orthodontist whose patient base largely consists of teenaged patients invisalign teen has grown from 3 of our total case volume when it was introduced in 2008 to 11 of our total case volume in 2010 we expect that orthodontists will continue to adopt invisalign teen steadily after they experience multiple successful treatment outcomes invisalign assist launched in 2008 is intended to help newlytrained and lower volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice most recently in october of 2010 we launched invisalign g3 the most significant collection of new features and innovation in our company history touching virtually every system and product significant improvements and enhancements were made to both our customerfacing systems invisalign doctor site and clincheck software and product features across our entire product line except for retainers 

on january 10 2011 we announced an agreement to jointly develop software applications that will run on cadent itero™ and ioc™ scanners for use in invisalign treatment cadent inc “cadent” is a manufacturer of 3d digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry the agreement embodies our commitment to innovation and our desire to improve the overall customer experience for invisalign providers the new applications will optimize case assessment and planning for invisalign treatment and bring valuable digital tools chairside for invisalign providers who use cadent scanners a series of applications will be developed over the next couple of years and we expect the first application to be available by the end of 2011 before we can bring these new applications to market we need to ensure interoperability with cadent scanners for use in invisalign treatment we have established very robust standards for scan quality and accuracy to ensure a specific scanning technology can successfully replace pvs impressions for invisalign treatment we are now in final beta tests to validate the cadent systems and expect to announce interoperability with cadent scanners in the second quarter of 2011 

  

we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase adoption and frequency of use what we call utilization or same practice sales of invisalign however we expect that adoption of these new products will increase gradually over a number of years during 2011 we plan to continue our efforts to demonstrate clinical efficacy and work towards a long term goal of becoming the orthodontic treatment of choice 

enhancing the customer experience and increasing adoption we are committed to enhancing the customer experience through the evolution of our customer facing systems and programs making it easier and more efficient for our customers to adopt invisalign into their practice and increase utilization specifically we provide robust clinical education resources and training programs clinical and field sales customer support assistance with practice development and incentive programs to encourage our customers integrate invisalign into their practice 

 

 we have also incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of 41 university programs by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option other resources that we offer our doctors include the aligntech institute wwwaligntechinstitutecom which is an interactive website that provides clinical education and practice development training these clinical education and practice development training opportunities include instructorled training classes seminars and workshops conference calls webbased videos case studies blogs and other clinical resources many of these courses and resources are eligible for continuing education ce credits additionally our invisalign doctor site provides our trained doctors and their staff access to thousands of invisalign cases and best practices as well as uptodate support information programs and marketing materials for continuous support and information access 

 

  

   

 increasing the effectiveness of our consumer demand creation and extending invisalign brand awareness marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving longterm growth our market research indicates that the majority of adults with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort in addition many parents also elect traditional treatment for their children due to limited awareness of invisalign applicability for teenager use our goals are to extend our leadership in clear aligner therapy with adults increase awareness and consumer demand with moms and teens and to continue expansion of the clear aligner category overall by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers—adults parents and teens—we intend to increase the number of patients who seek treatment using invisalign we continue to be successful with programs that more effectively and efficiently generate demand or “pull” for invisalign in 2010 we became more efficient in our approach we continued building awareness and demand through an integrated consumer marketing platform of traditional media event marketing and digital and social media in addition we continued to evolve our marketing program aimed at the teenage segment to increase awareness and educate prospective teen patients and their parents specifically we expanded our public relations and event marketing programs this past year for invisalign teen to include participation and sponsorship of major summer events such as the teen choice awards and journeyz backyard bbq tour a nationwide action sports tour we leveraged online and mobile widgets social media and blogs directly targeted to teens and launched a commercial prompting parents and teens to learn more about invisalign additionally we evolved the invisalign brand strategy while refreshing the invisalign look and feel with a more modern logo and new brand positioning updated consumer website and base marketing materials focused on treatment outcome and practice growth we will continue to build on these programs and efforts in 2011 

growth of international markets  we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in our key international markets similar to the north america market our objective internationally is to increase the number of doctors that are motivated to become an invisalign provider and committed to making invisalign a key part of their practices in 2010 our international sales increased from approximately 24 of net revenues to approximately 25 of net revenues through december 2010 we trained over 17400 doctors internationally predominantly orthodontists in europe which is our primary international market product line expansion is key to providing doctors with treatment options that address a wider range of potential patient needs with greater treatment flexibility invisalign teen will continue to gain adoption as specific europe teen marketing campaigns are being introduced in 2011 in addition we are preparing to launch invisalign g3 in the second quarter of 2011 invisalign g3 is engineered to deliver even better clinical results with new aligner and software features that make it easier to use invisalign with patient with class ii and class iii malocclusion due to the higher number of complex cases in international markets the planned international launch of the invisalign g3 features designed to address those complex treatment issues is a significant near term focus we will carry on our efforts to increase brand awareness and consumer demand in europe by continuing our consumer advertising campaign while beginning to focus on the teenage segment 

in october we announced that we had received regulatory approval from the chinese state food and drug administration sfda to market and sell the invisalign system as a class ii medical device for the treatment of malocclusion we received our license of medical device operation enterprise enterprise license from the 

  

shanghai food and drug administration which allows us to distribute invisalign in china we expect to begin commercial availability of invisalign in the second half of 2011 while we do not expect meaningful revenue from china for several years our focused strategy to launch invisalign in key major cities of china provides us a large growth opportunity long term 

additionally although the vast majority of our international revenues are from direct sales approximately 10 of our international sales are through distributors covering less strategic international markets specifically asia pacific latin america and smaller country markets in europe the middle east and africa with these efforts we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future 

manufacturing 

to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 

manufacturing administration is located in san jose california however our digital planning and manufacturing facilities are located outside of the us in san jose costa rica and juarez mexico as of december 31 2010 our digital planning manufacturing and operations staff in the us costa rica and mexico consisted of 1374 people at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans upon acceptance of the clincheck treatment plan by the dental professional these plans are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico the clincheck treatment plan and supporting digital files are used to manufacture sla stereolithography aligner molds our order acquisition operations the manufacturing of aligner molds and aligners as well as the packaging and shipment of aligners are conducted in our facility in juarez mexico information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 

throughput management 

because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continue to upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez mexico in order to meet the demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment and intend to add a new aligner fabrication facility outside of north america by the end of 2011 

quality assurance 

align’s quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the food and drug administration “fda” and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory 

  

authorities we are certified to en iso 134852003 an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed between june 29 and august 9 2010 the fda conducted a routine quality systems inspection of our san jose california facility the fda inspection resulted in the issuance of a form 483 notice that contained four observations related to how align reports and manages patient complaints we submitted a written response to the form 483 notice on august 26 and an additional written response on november 8 that provided a full and complete update of the corrective actions we had taken to our complaint and medical device reporting procedures to address the observations on november 18 2010 we received a warning letter from the fda which requested additional documentation relating to our written implemented corrective actions on november 22 we submitted a written response to the warning letter that included copies of documentation requested by the fda we are continuing to work closely with the fda to resolve and closeout the matter failure to fully address the fda’s concerns could result in further regulatory sanctions including additional warning letters adverse publicity refusal to clear or approve applications for new or modified products injunctions fines civil penalties or criminal prosecution any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

since we custom manufacture our aligners on a buildtoorder basis we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck treatment plan and each aligner is unique we inspect the product at various points during the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers’ expectations aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed in the event aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient’s dentition to us we use the impressions to create a new clincheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth 

sales and marketing 

we market invisalign by communicating the benefits of the invisalign system to dental professionals through our training programs online and traditional mail campaigns trade shows trade journals and print and to consumers through online and traditional advertising digital and social networking and event marketing based on our experience with marketing and commercial sales we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign 

professional marketing 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps throughout north america and internationally as of december 31 2010 there are approximately 43000 active invisalign providers worldwide 

as of december 31 2010 our north american sales organization consisted of 171 people of which 134 were quota carrying sales representatives and 37 were regional sales managers and administration 

  

internationally we had 54 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2010 we continually evaluate cost effective ways to support our customers in smaller markets for instance we use distributors for the sale of our products in part of the asia pacific latin american regions and smaller country markets in europe the middle east and africa we will consider selling through a distributor in other smaller markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a casebycase basis 

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment our sales teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form and submitting required records clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of the invisalign doctor site 

after doctors complete their training sales representatives may follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases these practice development activities may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions treatment planning processes and familiarizing them with our dental online portals and tools sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

consumer marketing 

our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from these primary sources 

 

  

  

  

  

 research and development 

our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of clinical effectiveness and applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the virtual clinical design manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign treatment options including the development of distinct product platforms that meet the specific needs of gps and orthodontists such as invisalign assist and invisalign teen our research and development expenses were 260 million for 2010 223 million for 2009 and 262 million for 2008 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process as mentioned in our business strategy we are making investments in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products to meet the needs of our customers and increase adoption and utilization of invisalign such as the agreement to jointly develop software applications with cadent 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2010 we had 152 issued us patents 136 pending us patent applications and 75 foreign issued patents as well as 128 pending foreign patent applications see item 3 “legal proceedings” for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 

  

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

seasonal fluctuations 

seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected and are likely to continue to affect our business specifically our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases particularly in europe in addition summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teens started in treatment before the start of the school year as a result adult appointments including adult invisalign patient starts are often pushed further into late summer or early fall with the availability of invisalign teen combined with our marketing efforts aimed at teens and parents we have been actively competing for a share of teen patient starts we believe that the increasing percentage of teenaged patients using invisalign helped moderate the downward trend we would otherwise see for our north american orthodontic customers during the summer months these seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the nature of our business we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which treatment data or “a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan our backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future sales our quarterly revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter 

competition 

we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets which include 3m’s unitek danaher corporation’s sybron dental specialties and dentsply international inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign including the products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties a division of danaher corporation and dentsply gac international a division of dentsply international inc in the future we may face further competition from early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

fda’s quality system regulation for medical devices  the invisalign system is classified as a class ii medical device in 1998 we received premarket clearance from the fda pursuant to the 510k premarket notification procedure allowing us to market the product in the us the invisalign system was originally cleared for use by the fda in patients with permanent teeth and contraindicated the device for patients presenting with mixed dentition severe overbite severe overjet tooth malocclusion requiring surgical correction adolescent patients with a skeletally narrow jaw and adult patients with dental prostheticsimplants in 2008 the fda cleared new labeling for the invisalign system by removing the permanent dentition limitation from the indications for use in addition certain conditions previously listed as contraindications are now listed as precautions we are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer 

if the fda determines that we failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 

health canada’s medical device regulations  in canada we are required to comply with health canada’s medical device regulations our products are registered with health canada we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada 

european union’s mdd requirements  iso 134852003  in europe invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such we follow the requirements of the medical device directives we are iso 134852003 certified which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe 

china’s fda regulations and enterprise license  in october 2010 we received regulatory approval from the chinese state food and drug administration sfda to market and sell the invisalign system as a class ii medical device for the treatment of malocclusion we also received its license of medical device operation enterprise enterprise license from the shanghai food and drug administration which allows us to distribute invisalign in china

 item 1a risk factors tableend we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign for any reason including as a result of changes to the proficiency program a continued weakness in general economic conditions or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect revenues gross margin and net profits 

we expect that revenues from the sale of the invisalign system will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed factors that could cause the adoption of invisalign to occur at a lower rate than we expect as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 

consumers may not adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the united states economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts or a reduction in the demand for invisalign generally either of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results in addition invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics greater comfort and hygiene compared to traditional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products 

orthodontists and gps may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate for a number of reasons including changes to the proficiency program or as a result of increased competition 

our success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the invisalign system by dental professionals what we refer to as utilization in april 2010 we eliminated the case start requirements and in october 2010 we eliminated the annual ce requirements effectively terminating the proficiency program we may experience variability in customer activity over the next several quarters as doctors adjust to the changes to the proficiency program requirements in addition increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice if adoption does not increase as we anticipate for any reason our revenues may fail to grow as expected and our operating results may be harmed 

the frequency of use by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of invisalign by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

  

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products 

in response to challenges in our business including increased competition we have in the past reduced the list price of our products we also provide volume based discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we introduce any price reductions or consumer rebate programs expand our discount programs in the future if participation in these programs increases if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or newer products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue or if sales by our international distributors particularly in the asiapacific region grows at a faster pace than our direct sales our average selling price would be adversely affected and our revenues gross margin and net profits losses may be reduced furthermore although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 

as we continue to grow we are subject to growth related risks including risks related to capacity constraints at our existing facilities 

we are subject to growthrelated risks including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational financial and management information systems and to hire train motivate manage and retain employees we may be unable to manage such growth effectively any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and prospects in addition in order to meet the demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion we intend to open a new manufacturing facility outside of north america by the end of 2011 our ability to plan construct and equip additional manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty including risks inherent in the establishment of a new manufacturing facility such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if the opening of this facility is significantly delayed or demand for our product in 2011 exceeds our current expectations we may not be able to fulfill orders timely which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business conversely if demand for our products decreases the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may harm our financial results 

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our revenues while controlling our expenses because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future 

  

operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products we launched invisalign teen in july 2008 and invisalign assist in october 2008 in october 2010 we introduced invisalign g3 a collection of new features and innovations that touch every product and virtually every system at align there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to include functionality and features that address customer requirements compatibility of our computer operating systems and hardware configurations with customers the availability of thirdparty reimbursement of procedures using our new products the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration “fda” and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our revenues and operating profits could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of 

  

the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our san jose california facility we also carry out research and development at locations in san jose costa rica and moscow russia in addition our customercare accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in costa rica our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

training technicians to use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the digital treatment plan that forms the basis of clincheck takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely create clincheck treatment plans within the timeframe our customers expect any delay in clincheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished aligners to our customers such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are all principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in 

  

juarez mexico both costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our invisalign product competes directly against products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties a danaher corporation subsidiary and traditional braces manufactured by 3m’s unitek and dentsply international these manufacturers have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues volume growth net profit losses and stock price we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations revenues and operating results 

we are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future system upgrades and enhancements including those upgrades and enhancements associated with the launch in the fall of 2010 of invisalign g3 that touched every product and virtually each of our systems require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results furthermore we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically the 

  

clincheck software and the invisalign doctor site software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2010 we had 152 issued us patents 136 pending us patent applications and 75 issued foreign patents and 128 pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 

litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include 

  

disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by a single supplier we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process from a single source in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these 

  

manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets as of december 31 2010 our north american sales organization consisted of 171 people of which 134 were quota carrying sales representatives and 37 were regional sales managers and administration internationally we had 54 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2010 we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our revenues may be harmed 

complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections for 

  

instance on november 18 2010 we received a warning letter from the fda which requested additional documentation relating to our written implemented corrective actions to our complaint and medical device reporting procedures we responded to the warning letter on november 22 2010 and we are working closely with the fda to address their concerns and close the matter should we fail to promptly and fully address the issues listed in the warning letter may result in further regulatory sanctions including additional warning letters adverse publicity refusal to clear or approve applications for new or modified products injunctions fines civil penalties or criminal prosecution any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years congress recently passed health care reform legislation that president obama signed into law in march 2010 the enacted legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain healthrelated industries including medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 each medical device manufacturer will have to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 23 percent of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices this tax applies to all medical devices including our products these taxes will result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

  

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 

  

  

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

we currently sell our products in europe asia pacific latin america and japan and may expand into other countries from time to time we do not know whether orthodontists gps and consumers outside our north american market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate in addition sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a securities class action suit was filed against us on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased our common stock between january 30 2007 and october 24 2007 while we believe the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves we could incur substantial legal fees and our management’s attention and resources may be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

 

  

  

  

 if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid shortterm fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector in an current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

we have adopted a shareholders rights’ plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our 

  

shareholders to date our board of directors has designated 200000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of align or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights’ plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of the tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 under these incentives all of the income we earn in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2010 as a result of these incentives income taxes were reduced by 127 million in 2010 in order to receive the benefit of the incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results

on june 29 2010 weber requested that the court enter final judgment as to align pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure 54b in order to certify align’s dismissal for immediate appeal we filed an opposition to weber’s request on july 19 2010 on the grounds that weber failed to show that exceptional circumstances warranted the entry of a final judgment where fewer than all claims or parties had been dismissed on august 20 2010 the court denied weber’s motion on october 29 2010 the court dismissed the action against orthoclear and orthoclear holdings inc with prejudice at the request of the remaining parties pursuant to a settlement the stipulation and order of dismissal with prejudice entered by the court provides that the settlement and dismissal does not affect any rights weber may have to appeal dismissal of the action as against us 

leiszler 

on may 10 2010 christopher j leiszler filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california the complaint alleges that we implemented unfair and fraudulent 

  

requirements for the prescription of invisalign through the invisalign proficiency requirements in january 2010 dr leiszler’s invisalign provider status was suspended for failing to meet the proficiency requirements dr leiszler sued on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated the complaint seeks a refund of the price paid to us for invisalign training on october 19 2010 we entered into a memorandum of understanding to resolve this litigation and on november 30 2010 we executed a formal stipulation of settlement which must be approved by the court on december 23 2010 the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement the court has scheduled a hearing in april 2011 to determine whether to grant final approval of the proposed settlement under terms of the proposed settlement class members can be reinstated to prescribe invisalign treatment under certain circumstances the “reinstatement benefit” certain class members will have the option to elect a cash remedy instead of the reinstatement benefit pursuant to the proposed settlement in january 2011 we deposited approximately 80 million into an escrow account to pay eligible class members who elect the cash remedy as well as legal fees and other costs we recorded a total litigation settlement charge of 45 million during 2010 for our estimated liability related to this settlement we will continue to assess and evaluate the matter with our legal counsel and update the estimated settlement charge as appropriate as new information becomes available 

securities litigation 

in august 2009 plaintiff charles wozniak filed a lawsuit against us and our chief executive officer and president thomas m prescott “mr prescott” in district court for the northern district of california on behalf of a claimed class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased our common stock of between january 30 2007 and october 24 2007 the complaint alleges that align and mr prescott violated section 10b of the securities exchange act of 1934 and that mr prescott violated section 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 specifically the complaint alleges that during the class period we failed to disclose that we had shifted the focus of our sales force to clearing backlog causing a significant decrease in the number of new case starts on november 13 2009 the court appointed plumbers and pipefitters national pension fund as lead plaintiff the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on january 29 2010 the amended complaint alleges that we and mr prescott issued a number of purportedly false and misleading statements throughout the class period concerning the patients first program our production capacity a purported backlog and the focus of our sales force on march 26 2010 we and mr prescott filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint the motion was heard by the court on july 9 2010 and the court has not yet released a ruling on the motion we believe the lawsuit to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 

litigating claims of the types discussed in this annual report on form 10k whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we design manufacture and market the invisalign system a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces we received the united states food and drug administration “fda” clearance to market invisalign in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 

we distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist or gp orthodontists and gps must complete an initial invisalign training course in order to begin providing the invisalign treatment solution to their patients the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asia pacific latin america and japan we use a distributor model for the sale of our products in parts of the asia pacific latin american and emea europe middle east and africa regions 

each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient our invisalign full treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by our proprietary clincheck software in order to achieve the doctors’ treatment goals our invisalign expresslite are lower cost solutions for less complex orthodontic cases such as adult relapse cases for minor crowding and spacing or as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers invisalign express uses up to 10 sets of aligners and is sold in the united states and canada invisalign lite uses up to 14 sets of aligners and is sold to our international customers invisalign teen is designed to meet the specific needs of the nonadult comprehensive or teenaged treatment market particularly younger teenagers aged 11 to 15 years invisalign assist is intended to help newlytrained and lower volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice upon completion of an invisalign or noninvisalign treatment the patient may be prescribed our traditional retainer product or our vivera retainers a clear aligner set designed for ongoing retention our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the four key objectives driving product and clinical innovation enhancing the customer experience increasing the effectiveness of consumer demand creation and extending invisalign brand awareness and continuing to drive international growth each of these four key objectives is described more fully in item i—business—business strategy of our 2010 annual report on form 10k as we execute on our business strategy we will continue to deliver significant evolutions in product features and functionality as well as customer facing systems 

in addition to the successful execution of our business strategy a number of other factors may affect our results in 2011 and beyond the most important of which are set forth below 

 

   

  

  

  

  

   

 

 

 utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2010 for the north american ortho and gp channels decreased slightly compared to the third quarter of 2010 summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as the percentage of teenaged patients using invisalign increases we expect that fourth quarter utilization rates especially in our north america orthodontist channel will be adversely impacted north american gp utilization decreased from the prior quarter which may have reflected a slowdown in patient traffic in our customer’s offices during the first half of the quarter on a year over year basis total worldwide utilization increased reflecting increased use across all customer channels 

 

 in 2010 sequential case growth from second quarter to the third quarter in the north american ortho channel was essentially flat with the availability of invisalign teen we can actively compete for a share of teen patient starts summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients many parents want to get their teens started in treatment before the start of the school year we believe that invisalign teen and the increasing percentage of teenaged patients using invisalign helped moderate the historical downward trend we have typically seen for our north american orthodontic customers during the summer months in the third quarter of 2010 we saw a decline in the number of cases submitted as well as a decline in the number of submitters in our north american gp channel which is consistent with our historical trend during this quarter

 case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by product for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 are as follows in thousands 

 

 fiscal year 2010 compared to fiscal year 2009 

total net revenues increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of worldwide volume growth across all customer channels the release of revenue previously deferred for invisalign teen replacement aligners in the second quarter of 2010 contributed an additional 143 million to total net revenues for 2010 

in 2010 north america revenue increased 176 compared to 2009 due to overall case volume growth of 152 as well as an increase in our average selling price higher case volume was driven primarily by the north american orthodontic channel reflecting increased penetration into the teenage orthodontic market especially with the invisalign teen product additionally the increase also reflects a significant reduction in our revenue deferral rate for teen replacement aligners and lower discounts and rebates 

our international invisalign revenue increased 251 in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to 295 growth in case volumes across all products partially offset by a mix shift towards our lower priced products as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates 

invisalign teen includes up to six replacement aligners which may be ordered at any time throughout treatment through the second quarter of 2010 revenue for these replacement aligners was deferred based on 100 percent of the fair value of the aligners until the replacement aligners were used or the case completed since the launch of invisalign teen over two years ago we evaluated the usage experience of the replacement aligners and determined that there is sufficient historical experience to establish an estimated usage rate as a result in june 2010 we reduced deferred revenue for invisalign teen replacement aligners by 143 million to reflect the lower estimated usage for inprocess cases 

  

other noncase revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increased sales of our vivera and retainer products 

fiscal year 2009 compared to fiscal year 2008 

total net revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our international and north american orthodontic channels and partially offset by a slight decline in north american gp revenues 

overall 2009 north american invisalign revenues were comparable to 2008 and reflect a full year impact of product mix shifting from invisalign full towards invisalign teen and invisalign assist both of which have higher amounts of deferred revenue than invisalign full additionally 2009 north american revenues also include the full year impact of north american price increases that were effective in the beginning of the year the north american orthodontic channel experienced an increase in revenue and case volume primarily driven by the full year availability of invisalign teen north american gp revenues declined in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of the product mix shift towards invisalign assist combined with an overall slightly lower case volume 

our international invisalign revenues grew in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of increased invisalign full case volumes and was supplemented by a partial year impact of invisalign teen which was launched in march 2009 this increase was offset by unfavorable exchange rates 

other revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were lower in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a decreased number of doctors trained year over year 

cost of revenues and gross margin in millions 

 

 cost of revenues includes salaries for staff involved in the production process the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process training costs and stockbased compensation expense through april 2009 cost of revenues also included the cost of our third party shelter service provider in juarez mexico 

gross margin improved in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the increase in case volume which resulted in higher cost absorption and reduced cost per case additionally the gross margin for 2010 was favorably impacted by the release of teen deferred revenue of 143 million during 2010 

gross margin improved slightly in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure continued improvement in operating efficiencies and the cost savings from the commencement of direct fabrication of our aligners these efficiencies were partially offset by 62 million of royalty costs resulting from the ormco litigation settlement 

sales and marketing in millions 

 

   

sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation including travelrelated costs marketing personnelrelated costs media and advertising clinical education product marketing and stockbased compensation expense 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to increases in media advertising travel and entertainment costs of 25 million and higher facility information technology costs of approximately 18 million primarily associated with the preparation and transition into our new building these costs were partially offset by approximately 16 million of clinical education costs that were included in gross margin during the first three quarters in 2010 as a result of the proficiency program as well as lower sales commission expenses of approximately 13 million 

sales and marketing expense decreased during 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 48 million reduction in commissionrelated costs as a result of the restructuring plans implemented in 2008 as well as lower marketing media and clinical education expenses of 15 million associated with our 2008 product launches these costs were partially offset by higher sales commission expenses of 43 million 

general and administrative in millions 

 

 general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel outside consulting services legal expenses and stockbased compensation expense 

general and administrative expense for 2010 increased compared to 2009 primarily due to higher payrollrelated and credit card processing costs of approximately 18 million as well as higher legal accounting and consulting fees of approximately 10 million 

general and administrative expense decreased slightly during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower outside services relating to legal fees of 25 million these costs were partially offset by higher payrollrelated costs 

research and development in millions 

 

 research and development expense includes the personnelrelated costs and outside consulting expenses associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products conducting clinical and postmarketing trials and stockbased compensation expense 

research and development expense increased in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to higher payrollrelated costs of approximately 22 million as a result of an increased headcount in 2010 and higher facility and information technology costs of approximately 09 million primarily associated with the transition to our new building 

  

research and development expense decrease in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower payrollrelated expenses of approximately 24 million as well as lower outside consulting expenses of approximately 10 million 

restructurings in millions 

 

 during 2008 we announced restructuring plans in july and october to increase efficiencies across the organization and with the expectation of lowering the overall cost structure by approximately 35 million per quarter in july 2008 we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our full time headcount by 67 employees including a phasedconsolidation of order acquisition operations from our then corporate headquarters in santa clara california to juarez mexico which was completed by the end of 2008 the october restructuring plan included a total reduction of 111 full time headcount in santa clara california by july 2009 when we moved our customer care accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations in santa clara california to our existing facilities in costa rica 

we incurred approximately 13 million during 2009 of cost related to severance and termination benefits where in 2008 we incurred approximately 62 million in restructuring expenses that included 07 million related to the acceleration of stock option vesting and 55 million related to severance and termination benefits there was no restructuring activity during 2010 

litigation settlement in millions 

 

 ormco 

in august 16 2009 we entered into a litigation settlement with ormco valued at 767 million which was comprised of a cash payment of 132 million and a stock issuance of approximately 76 million shares of common stock we recognized the litigation settlement of 697 million in our operating expenses the remaining 70 million was recorded to prepaid expenses of which 62 million was amortized to cost of sales based on case shipments during 2009 and 08 million during the first quarter of 2010 

leiszler 

on october 19 2010 we entered into a memorandum of understanding to resolve a complaint filed by dr leiszler as a result we recorded a total litigation settlement charge of 45 million in 2010 for settlement costs see note 6 “litigation settlements” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the settlement accounting 

insurance settlement in millions 

 

   

in june 2010 we received an 87 million insurance settlement over a disputed coverage under our general liability umbrella that was not previously reimbursed by our insurer related to the orthoclear litigation 

interest and other income expense net in millions 

 

 interest and other income expense net include interest income earned on cash balances interest expense foreign currency translation gains and losses and other miscellaneous charges 

interest income and interest expense in 2010 was consistent with 2009 other expense net increased in 2010 compared to 2009 by 09 million reflecting increases in foreign exchange losses during 2010 

interest income in 2009 decreased by 25 million compared to 2008 primarily due to lower returns on our investments interest rates for investments throughout the marketplace were lower due to the low federal funds rate during 2009 other expense net decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting increases in foreign exchange gains during 2009 

provision for benefit from income taxes in millions 

 

 we recorded an income tax provision of 278 million for 2010 and income tax benefits of 26 million and 630 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively these represented effective tax rates of 272 77 and 3684 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 

we exercised significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth forecasted earnings and projected taxable income in determining the provision for income taxes and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future benefit from deferred tax assets at december 31 2008 based on an evaluation of the available positive and negative evidence we determined that most of our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards in making that determination we considered the historical and projected pretax operating profit excluding stockbased compensation as well as the cyclical nature of our business and the uncertainty as to the impact of new product launches specifically at december 31 2008 we considered the following positive evidence 

 

  

 we also considered the following negative evidence 

 

  

   

we believed that the positive evidence is of sufficient quality and quantity to overcome the negative evidence and as a result we released our tax valuation allowance of 646 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 the remaining valuation allowance of approximately 61 million is related to capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2010 because we cannot forecast sufficient future capital gains or foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets these net operating loss carryforwards will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 

the california 20092010 budget legislation included the ability to elect to apply a single sales factor apportionment for years beginning after january 1 2011 as a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor we are required to remeasure our deferred taxes taking into account the expected california tax rate under the elective single sales factor we have determined that by electing a single sales factor apportionment our deferred tax assets decreased by approximately 12 million net of federal benefit of the 12 million tax impact 06 million was recorded as a discrete item in 2009 and the remaining 06 million was recorded as a discrete item in 2010 

at december 31 2010 we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 1345 million which if not used will begin to expire in 2020 these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code § 382 but are expected to be fully realized furthermore we have california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 676 million which if not used will begin to expire in 2013 at december 31 2010 we had research credit carryforwards of approximately 45 million for federal purposes and 38 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 

financial accounting standard board “fasb” accounting standard codification “asc” 718 prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled 93 million as of december 31 2010 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 

we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from nonus operations as of december 31 2010 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales and the proceeds from the sale of our common stock as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we had the following cash and cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in thousands 

 

   

cash flows in thousands 

 

 operating activities 

for the year ended december 31 2010 cash flows from operations of 1295 million resulted primarily from our net income of approximately 743 million and the following reasons

 changes in working capital 

 

  

  

  

 for the year ended december 31 2009 cash flows from operations of 742 million resulted primarily from the following reasons listed below offset by our net loss of 313 million

 for the year ended december 31 2008 cash flows from operations of 397 million resulted primarily from our net income of approximately 800 million and the following reasons 

changes in noncash activities 

 

  

 changes in working capital 

 

 investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 159 million for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily consisted of approximately 364 million for purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment which was partially offset by net maturities of our marketable securities of 206 million although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 

net cash used in investing activities was 16 million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily consisted of approximately 72 million used for the purchase of property and equipment which were partially offset by 60 million of net maturities from marketable securities 

net cash used in investing activities was 11 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily consisted of 143 million for the purchase of property and equipment which were partially offset by 129 million of net maturities of marketable securities 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 147 million for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily resulting from approximately 118 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately 40 million from excess tax provision from our sharebased arrangements these proceeds were partially offset by approximately 10 million of taxes paid for our employees’ vesting of restricted stock units 

net cash provided by financing activities was 68 million for the year ended december 31 2009 which resulted primarily from 81 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock these proceeds were partially offset from the tax benefit excess of sharedbased payments and taxes paid on vesting restricted stock units of 11 million 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 404 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and resulted primarily from our 501 million stock repurchase including commissions which were partially offset by 105 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock principally from exercises of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting restricted stock units “rsus” which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercise as a result we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods in addition because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2010 2009 and 2008 we paid 11 million 05 million and 05 million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers respectively 

stock repurchase 

on april 29 2008 we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program of up to 50 million during the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 47 million shares of common stock at an average price of 1076 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 501 million including commissions as of december 31 2008 we had completed repurchases under the stock repurchase authorization there were no stock repurchases in 2010 or 2009 

line of credit 

on december 14 2010 we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank under this revolving line of credit we have 300 million of available borrowings with a maturity date of december 31 2012 the interest rate on borrowings will range from libor plus 15 to 20 depending upon the amount of cash we maintain at comerica bank this credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of 100 million additionally in the event our unrestricted cash deposited is less than 550 million the unused facility fee will increase from 0050 per quarter to 0125 per quarter as of december 31 2010 we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and are in compliance with the financial covenants 

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 

 

 on january 26 2010 we entered into an agreement to lease new corporate headquarters of approximately 129024 square feet in san jose california the lease agreement commenced on june 28 2010 and will continue for an initial term of seven years and two months the agreement for our previous corporate headquarters in santa clara california expired on june 30 2010 

as part of the proposed terms related to the leiszler class action settlement in january 2011 we deposited approximately 80 million for certain class members who elect the cash remedy into an escrow account 

  

our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately 110 million of noncurrent uncertain tax benefits which are included in other longterm obligations on our balance sheet as of december 31 2010 we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities if any 

we expect capital expenditures to increase in 2011 compared to 2010 as we invest in our manufacturing facility in juarez mexico to add incremental capacity in addition in order to meet the increased demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion we expect to open an additional aligner fabrication site outside of north america by the end of 2011 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2010 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred revenues are recognized from product sales net of discounts and rebates service revenues related to the training of dental professionals and staff on the invisalign treatment processes are recorded when the services are completed 

we enter into arrangements that involve multiple future deliverables included in the price of invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist we offer case refinement which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient’s teeth to the desired final position case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement deliverable and recognize the residual revenue upon shipment we defer the fair value of case refinement upon shipment based on a breakage factor which is determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement usage actual usage rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue 

  

invisalign teen is delivered in a single shipment except for six replacement aligners that are included in the price of the product and may be ordered at any time throughout treatment we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the replacement aligners and recognize the residual revenue upon initial shipment through the second quarter of 2010 we deferred 100 percent of the fair value for the six replacement aligners this deferred revenue was subsequently recognized as the replacement aligners were shipped or when the case was completed management evaluated the actual usage of replacement aligners since the launch of invisalign teen over two years ago and believes that there is sufficient historical evidence to establish an estimated usage rate as a result in june 2010 we reduced deferred revenue for invisalign teen replacement aligners by 143 million to reflect the estimated usage for inprocess cases and starting in july 2010 we began deferring the fair value of the replacement aligners based on the estimated usage rate we believe that this estimated usage is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the invisalign teen replacement utilization since it was first offered although we are not expecting any material changes we will continue to analyze the usage of replacement aligners and may adjust the estimated usage rate as necessary 

the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized as each shipment occurs for invisalign assist when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages for these cases revenue is deferred upon the first staged shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment 

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award net of an estimated forfeiture rate we estimate the fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term and stock price volatility in addition judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future see note 10 “stockholders’ equity” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

longlived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets 

longlived assets including intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses in 2008 management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of 17 million which was recorded in general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 there were no asset impairments during 2010 or 2009 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance 

we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2008 with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards we determined that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would be realized accordingly we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of 646 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

as of december 31 2010 with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards we believed that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be realized however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are fixedrate shortterm and longterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 177 million invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2010 and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 

currency rate risk 

we operate in north america europe asiapacific costa rica and japan as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions the impact of an aggregate decline of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material

 item 1 business tableend our company 

align technology inc designs manufactures and markets the invisalign system a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces we received the united states food and drug administration “fda” clearance to market invisalign in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 

we distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist or gp in order to provide the invisalign treatment solution to their patients orthodontists and gps must initially complete an invisalign training course in addition for north america dental professionals every invisalign provider must start 10 invisalign cases and complete at least 10 invisalignspecific continuing education ce credits each calendar year see discussion of invisalign proficiency requirements in item 1 – business – business strategy – becoming a leading invisalign provider  the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asia pacific latin america and japan we use a distributor model for the sale of our products in parts of the asia pacific and latin american regions additionally we recently announced the addition of an international distributor for the smaller country markets in europe the middle east and africa 

we were incorporated in delaware in april 1997 our headquarters are currently located at 881 martin avenue santa clara california 95050 and our telephone number is 4084701000 in january 2010 we entered into a lease agreement for office space located at 2560 orchard parkway san jose california for our new corporate headquarters we expect to commence conducting business at this location on or about june 28 2010 our international headquarters are located in amsterdam netherlands our digital planning and software facility is located in san jose costa rica and our aligner manufacturing facility is located in juarez mexico 

  

industry background 

malocclusion 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting approximately 50 to 75 of the population of major developed countries or nearly a billion individuals approximately 4 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 22 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign—our served market while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with traditional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek treatment 

traditional orthodontic treatment 

in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patient’s teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices 

the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient’s teeth with a bonding agent and attach an arch wire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient’s teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us 3500 to 7000 with a median fee of approximately 5000 generally only a portion of the fee is reimbursed by insurance fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional’s estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time and reduced profitability for the dental professional 

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment 

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages traditional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment additionally teenagers that seek orthodontic treatment have traditionally only had the option of braces for treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an alternative orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns 

the invisalign solution 

invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion the invisalign system is comprised of several phases the principal steps of which are the creation of customized digital treatment plans using proprietary software known as clincheck which occurs in our facility in san jose costa rica and the manufacturing of customized invisalign aligners which occurs in our facility in juarez mexico 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches xrays of the patient’s dentition photographs of the patient a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient’s upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form or prescription the impression is a critical component of the invisalign system as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patient’s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models and subsequent molds and aligners an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patient’s teeth the prescription is also a critical component of the invisalign system describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our facility in juarez mexico 

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition using computed tomography known as ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional’s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facility in san jose costa rica 

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulated treatment plan called clincheck is an internally developed and proprietary computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients this clincheck simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon completion of the review the patient’s clincheck is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via virtual invisalign practice vip our proprietary customer interfacing software portal which is available on our websites located at wwwinvisaligncom and wwwaligntechcom  the dental professional then reviews the clincheck and can either 

  

accept the proposed treatment or request modifications and adjustments until satisfied with the treatment plan clincheck allows the dental professional to view this threedimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly clincheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to view the treatment plan allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professional’s final approval of the proposed clincheck treatment engages us to manufacture the corresponding molds and aligners in juarez mexico 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck simulation we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment these molds are then used to fabricate the patient’s aligners 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck each aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment simulation after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series advancing the teeth movement with each aligner stage this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete when treating with invisalign full invisalign express and invisalign teen aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment for invisalign assist aligners are manufactured in batches based on a progress tracking feature integrated into invisalign assist when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with toothcolored attachments bonded to the patient’s teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement we provide an alignerlike template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s teeth where needed also in cases where interproximal reduction or ipr is required or requested by the dental professional we provide an ipr treatment form quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction location and timing of ipr 

retention upon completion of the treatment the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product vivera retainers are shipped every three months over the one year period

retention in addition to our traditional single retainer product we offer vivera retainers where we deliver a new replacement retainer to orthodontic patients every three months for one year vivera retainers are produced using the same proprietary technology and material as the invisalign aligners and offer an effective aesthetic retention solution for both invisalign and noninvisalign patients 

training ancillary and other the remaining net revenues are generated by training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 

proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck and vip virtual invisalign practice are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue 

benefits of invisalign 

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to traditional braces 

benefits to the dental professional 

 

   

  

 benefits to the patient 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of traditional braces or as an alternative more aesthetic treatment option for teenagers 

limitations of invisalign 

in some instances the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to traditional treatment aligners cost more to produce than traditional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in traditional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional and the treatment selected the cost of invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for traditional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there are a variety of factors that may impact when the corresponding aligners are delivered one of which includes the timing of when the dental professional 

  

accepts the case aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with traditional braces for optimal results in addition because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech in some instances patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have been reported we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 

our target market and patient base 

our market research indicates that the majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces adults who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment will be more likely to seek treatment and therefore represent our most immediate market expansion opportunity with the launch of invisalign teen in july 2008 we now offer a product designed to meet the needs of the nonadult comprehensive or younger teen treatment market invisalign teen makes our treatment more applicable to an orthodontist’s patient base which we believe will provide us the opportunity to increase our penetration into and our share of the teen treatment market 

approximately 4 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately 22 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign—our served market twentythree percent of these patients or approximately 510000 have mature dentition adults and older teens with fullyerupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth seventyseven percent or approximately 17 million have erupting dentition nonadult comprehensive or younger teens with partiallyerupted second molars cuspid and second bicuspid teeth as of december 31 2009 our share of the 22 million patients in our served market is approximately 6 

published market data for gps providing treatment for malocclusion is limited however as the primary care provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base we believe gps represent a significant market expansion opportunity 

as of december 31 2009 approximately 1164695 patients cumulatively worldwide have started treatment using invisalign the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asia pacific latin america and japan international sales accounted for 24 21 and 17 of our net revenues in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in note 18 “segments and geographical information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we operate as one reportable segment—the design development manufacturing and marketing of invisalign additionally no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total net revenues in 2009 2008 and 2007 

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the following key strategic initiatives 

 

  

  

  

   

product innovation and clinical effectiveness we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future longterm goal to drive and sustain product adoption our primary channels—gps and orthodontists—each have distinct and separate needs specifically orthodontists want a more robust set of tools for greater predictability wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system on the other hand typical gps want greater ease of use more efficient and simplified diagnostic tools guidance through the case setup process minimal treatment intervention and selfhelp tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion based on this knowledge we announced two new products in 2008 to address these distinct needs in july 2008 we released invisalign teen which is designed to meet the specific needs of the nonadult comprehensive or younger teen market predominantly marketed to the orthodontist the launch of a teenspecific product makes the invisalign system more applicable to an orthodontist’s patient base which we believe will increase our penetration into and our share of the teen treatment market over time invisalign teen has grown from 3 of our total case volume when it was introduced in 2008 to 12 of our total case volume in 2009 and we expect that orthodontists will continue to adopt invisalign teen slowly after they experience multiple successful treatment outcomes in october 2008 we announced the release of invisalign assist which is intended to help newlytrained and lower volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice invisalign assist features are intended to make it easier for doctors to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach in october 2009 additional features were added or enhanced in invisalign assist that are intended to expand the capabilities of invisalign assist and give doctors the confidence and control necessary to treat a wider range of patients we also introduced new and enhanced features in all other invisalign products the new product line features are designed to overcome barriers to treatment by addressing clinical issues that some orthodontists and gps have traditionally perceived as challenging in invisalign treatment such as extrusion and rotation of teeth root movements and interproximal reduction ipr we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase adoption and frequency of use what we call utilization or same practice sales of invisalign however we expect that adoption of these new products will increase gradually over a number of years 

we continue to make significant progress with new products and features for invisalign yet total invisalign case starts are still small relative to our total served market during 2010 we plan to continue our efforts to demonstrate clinical efficacy and work towards a long term goal of becoming the orthodontic treatment of choice 

enhancing the customer experience and increasing adoption we are committed to enhancing the customer experience by focusing on specific customer “touch points” or areas where we interact directly with our customers specifically we provide robust clinical education resources and training programs improving customer support providing field sales support and helping doctors with practice development on how to better integrate invisalign into their practice 

 

   

 we have also incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of 38 university programs by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option other resources that we offer our doctors include the aligntech institute program wwwaligntechinstitutecom  which is an interactive website that provides clinical education and practice development training these clinical education and practice development training opportunities include instructorled training classes seminars and workshops conference calls webbased videos case studies and other clinical resources many of these courses and resources are eligible for continuing education ce credits additionally our vip portal virtual invisalign practice provides our trained doctors and their staff access to thousands of invisalign cases and best practices as well as uptodate support information programs and marketing materials for continuous support and information access 

 

  

 on june 2 2009 we announced the implementation of the invisalign product proficiency requirements or the proficiency requirements in north america to help ensure that invisaligntrained doctors have the experience and confidence necessary to achieve high quality treatment outcomes for invisalign patients under the proficiency requirements every invisalign provider in north america must have 10 invisalign case starts measured by clincheck acceptance and complete at least 10 invisalignspecific continuing education ce credits each calendar year doctors who met the proficiency requirements of 10 case starts and 10 invisalign ce hours by the end of 2009 will benefit from a new addition to align’s consumer marketing programs one that encourages prospective patients to seek out “invisalign preferred providers” starting in january 2010 this new invisalign preferred designation will be highlighted on the invisalign web site and in television ads as a way to recognize doctors’ commitment to continued proficiency with invisalign the invisalign preferred designation will then be awarded on an annual basis to doctors who meet the proficiency requirements for a given year 

in october 2009 we updated the proficiency requirements in order to further support our customers through this significant change and provided a onetime additional six month qualification period for doctors who were unable to meet the proficiency requirements for 2009 but demonstrated a desire to continue using invisalign the additional six month qualification period stipulated that doctors who had at least one case start and at least one invisalign ce hour at the end of 2009 will be allowed to maintain their active invisalign provider status through june 30 2010 provided that they meet half of the annual proficiency requirements at least 5 case starts and 5 invisalign ce hours between january 1 and june 30 2010 doctors will still be responsible for meeting the total annual requirements of at least 10 case starts and 10 invisalign ce hours by the end of 2010 to qualify as providers for the following year 

doctors with zero case starts or zero invisalign ce hours at the end of 2009 were not eligible for the additional qualification period they will be able to continue treating inprogress cases but will not be 

  

able to submit new invisalign cases or use invisalign branding or marketing resources doctors can reactivate their provider status by retaking invisalign clear essentials i training and meeting the proficiency requirements during the new calendar year 

as of january 2010 approximately 6400 doctors met the invisalign proficiency requirements and another 15800 doctors met the criteria for the additional sixmonth qualification period in 2009 we limited the account status of approximately 13400 doctors who did not meet either proficiency requirements or the additional qualification period requirements but can continue treating and finishing in progress patients in addition we deactivated approximately 9600 invisaligntrained doctors who had never submitted a single invisalign case see item 1a – risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for risks related to the proficiency requirements 

increasing the effectiveness of our consumer demand creation and refreshing the invisalign brand   marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving longterm growth our market research indicates that the majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to increase the number of patients who seek treatment using invisalign historically our marketing programs have been directed to an adult audience however with the introduction of invisalign teen this past year we directed our communication efforts directly to teens and their parents we continue to be successful with programs that more effectively and efficiently generate demand or “pull” for invisalign in 2009 we became more efficient in our approach and grew overall lead generation and awareness on lower total spending we also shifted our marketing mix from conventional media towards more digital marketing and social networking activity we introduced a new public relations program for invisalign teen launched a teen specific website and leveraged online and mobile widgets social media and blogs directly targeted to teens we believe that consumer demand creation is a key component to our longterm growth as a result we will continue to invest in efforts to increase consumer awareness of invisalign through a variety of media outlets we will continue to drive consumer demand among the adult population primarily though our conventional media programs and increasingly leverage digital and event marketing and social networking activity to directly target teens and their parents additionally we are evolving the invisalign brand strategy while refreshing the invisalign look and feel we are introducing a new and more modern logo and new brand positioning focused on treatment outcome and practice growth as part of this effort in january 2010 we completely updated our consumer website wwwinvisaligncom  wwwaligntechinstitutecom  and wwwinvisaligncomteen and base marketing materials preferred providers will be the first customers to be able to utilize the new invisalign branding for use in their own marketing 

growth of international markets we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in our key international markets europe and japan similar to the north america market our objective internationally is to increase the number of doctors that are motivated to become an invisalign provider and committed to making invisalign a key part of their practices through december 31 2009 we have trained over 15700 doctors predominantly orthodontists in core europe our primary international market product line expansion is key to providing doctors a solution that addresses a wider range of potential patient needs with greater treatment flexibility in march 2009 we announced the availability of invisalign teen for invisaligntrained doctors worldwide except for japan as a result we expect the addressable market for our product to expand and ultimately increase adoption in addition we will carry on our efforts to increase brand awareness and consumer demand in europe by continuing our consumer advertising campaign additionally although the vast majority of our international revenues are from direct sales approximately 9 of our international sales are through distributors covering smaller international markets specifically asia pacific and latin america we will consider selling through distributors in other smaller or less strategic markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a casebycase basis for example we recently announced the addition of an international distributor for smaller country markets in europe the middle east and africa with these efforts we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future in 2009 our international sales increased from 21 of net revenues to 24 of net revenues 

  

manufacturing 

to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 

manufacturing administration is located in santa clara california however our digital planning and manufacturing facilities are located outside of the us in san jose costa rica and juarez mexico as of december 31 2009 our digital planning manufacturing and operations staff in the us costa rica and mexico consisted of 1271 people at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans upon acceptance of the clincheck setup treatment plan by the dental professional these plans are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico clincheck and supporting digital files are used to manufacture sla stereolithography aligner molds our order acquisition operations the manufacturing of aligner molds and aligners as well as the packaging and shipment of aligners are conducted in our facility in juarez mexico in april 2009 we terminated our shelter services arrangements with international manufacturing solutions operaciones srl or ims and became a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in juarez mexico information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 

throughput management 

because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continue to upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez mexico in order to scale our manufacturing capacity we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment 

quality assurance 

align’s quality system is in compliance with food  drug administration’s medical device regulations 21cfr part 820 and health canada’s medical device regulations we are certified to en iso 134852003 internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since we custom manufacture aligners on a buildtoorder basis we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck and each aligner is unique we inspect the product at various points during the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers’ expectations aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed in the event aligners fall within the 

  

scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient’s dentition to us we use the impressions to create a new clincheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth 

sales and marketing 

we market invisalign by communicating the benefits of the invisalign system to dental professionals through our training programs mail campaigns trade shows trade journals and print media and to consumers through advertising digital media event marketing and social networking activities based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign 

professional marketing 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps throughout north america and internationally as of december 31 2009 we had trained 59890 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those trained dental professionals approximately 74 are dental professionals in our north american market within our north american market we have trained 8935 orthodontists and 35215 gps cumulatively through the end of 2009 as part of the proficiency requirements in january 2010 we deactivated approximately 9600 invisaligntrained doctors who had never submitted an invisalign case in addition we limited the account status of approximately 13400 doctors who did not meet either the proficiency requirements or the additional qualification period requirements but can continue treating and finishing in progress patients see discussion of invisalign product proficiency requirements in item 1—business—business strategy—“becoming a leading invisalign provider” 

as of december 31 2009 our north american sales organization consisted of 164 people of which 150 were direct sales representatives and 14 were sales administration and management internationally we had 45 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2009 we continually evaluate cost effective ways to support our customers in smaller markets for instance we use distributors for the sale of our products in part of the asia pacific and latin american regions we have also recently announced the addition of an international distributor in the smaller country markets in europe the middle east and africa we will consider selling through a distributor in other smaller markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a casebycase basis 

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of our website 

after doctors complete their training sales representatives may follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases these practice development activities may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions treatment planning processes and familiarizing 

  

them with our dental online portals and tools sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

consumer marketing 

our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from these primary sources 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 research and development 

our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of clinical effectiveness and applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines including the development of distinct product platforms for the gps and orthodontists such as invisalign assist and invisalign teen our research and development expenses were 223 million for 2009 262 million for 2008 and 257 million for 2007 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process as mentioned in our business strategy we are making investments in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products to meet the needs of our customers and increase adoption and utilization of invisalign 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2009 we had 131 issued us patents 160 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as 122 pending foreign patent applications see item 3 “legal proceedings” for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

  

seasonal fluctuations 

seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected and are likely to continue to affect our business specifically our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases particularly in europe in addition summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients many parents want to get their teens started in treatment before the start of the school year as a result adult appointments including adult invisalign patient starts are often pushed further into late summer or early fall however with the availability of invisalign teen 2009 was the first summer we were able to actively compete for a share of teen patient starts we believe that invisalign teen may have helped and may in the future help moderate the historical downward trend we have typically seen for our north american orthodontic customers during the summer months these seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the nature of our business we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which treatment data or “a case” is received until the acceptance of the digital treatment plan or clincheck is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved clincheck our backlog consists of clincheck approved cases which are generally shipped within a short period of time as a result we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future sales and our quarterly revenues depend largely on the timing of clincheck approvals and the impact on cases shipped in that quarter 

competition 

we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets which include 3m’s unitek danaher corporation’s sybron dental specialties and dentsply international inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign including the products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties a division of danaher corporation in the future we may face further competition from early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

  

government regulation 

fda’s quality system regulation for medical devices the invisalign system is classified as a class ii medical device in 1998 we received premarket clearance from the fda pursuant to the 510k premarket notification procedure allowing us to market the product in the us the invisalign system was originally cleared for use by the fda in patients with permanent teeth and contraindicated the device for patients presenting with mixed dentition severe overbite severe overjet tooth malocclusion requiring surgical correction adolescent patients with a skeletally narrow jaw and adult patients with dental prostheticsimplants in 2008 the fda cleared new labeling for the invisalign system by removing the permanent dentition limitation from the indications for use in addition certain conditions previously listed as contraindications will now be listed as precautions we believe our invisalign system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the invisalign system we are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer 

if the fda determines that we failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 

health canada’s medical device regulations in canada we are required to comply with health canada’s medical device regulations our products are registered with health canada we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada 

european union’s mdd requirements  iso 134852003 in europe invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such we follow the requirements of the medical device directives we are iso 134852003 certified which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe 

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information although compliance is the responsibility of the hospital physician or other healthcare provider we understand the importance to our customers and their patients of maintaining the confidentiality of patient information accordingly we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements 

other federal and state laws as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business we are a medical device manufacturer subject to us food and drug administration regulations these regulations among other things require that we maintain device and facilities registrations and listings as well as promote our products as permitted by our fda clearances furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be 

  

used by us released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions under the federal anti kickback statute prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws which are evolving at the federal and state levels are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we had 1895 employees including 1271 in manufacturing and operations 281 in sales and marketing 132 in research and development and 211 in general and administrative functions we had 411 employees in north america 766 employees in costa rica 177 employees in europe 531 employees in mexico and 10 employees in japan

 item 1a risk factors tableend we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign for any reason including as a result of the introduction of the proficiency requirements or a continued weakness in general economic conditions or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect revenues gross margin and net profits 

we expect that revenues from the sale of the invisalign system will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed factors that could cause the adoption of invisalign to occur at a lower rate than we expect as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 

consumers may not adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued weakness in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the united states economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts or a reduction in the demand for invisalign generally either of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results in addition invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients increased market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics greater comfort and hygiene compared to traditional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products 

orthodontists and gps may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate for a number of reasons including the introduction of the proficiency requirements or continued weakness in general economic conditions 

our success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the invisalign system by dental professionals what we refer to as utilization we have a large number of low volume doctors that make up a large portion of our customer base we want every invisalign provider to be one we can comfortably direct a prospective patient to with an expectation of knowledgeable treatment and a great outcome on june 2 2009 we announced the implementation of the invisalign proficiency requirements or the proficiency requirements in north america to help ensure that invisaligntrained doctors have the experience and confidence necessary to achieve high quality treatment outcomes for invisalign patients under the proficiency requirements every invisalign provider in north america must have 10 invisalign case starts measured by clincheck acceptance and complete at least 10 invisalignspecific continuing education ce credits each calendar year in october 2009 we updated the proficiency requirements in order to further support our customers through this significant change and provided a onetime additional six month qualification period stipulating that for those doctors who had at least one case start and at least one invisalign ce hour at the end of 2009 will be allowed to maintain their active invisalign provider status through june 30 2010 provided that they meet half of the annual proficiency requirements at least 5 case starts and 5 invisalign ce hours between january 1 and june 30 2010 doctors will still be responsible for meeting the total annual requirements of at least 10 case starts and 10 invisalign ce 

  

hours by the end of 2010 to qualify as providers for the following year doctors with zero case starts or zero invisalign ce hours at the end of 2009 were not eligible for the additional qualification period they will be able to continue treating inprogress cases but will not be able to submit new invisalign cases or use invisalign branding or marketing resources doctors can reactivate their provider status by retaking invisalign training and meeting the proficiency requirements 

as of january 2010 approximately 6400 doctors met the invisalign proficiency requirements and another 15800 doctors met the criteria for the additional sixmonth qualification period in 2009 we limited the account status of approximately 13400 doctors who did not meet either proficiency requirements or the additional qualification period requirements these doctors can continue treating and finishing in progress patients in addition we deactivated approximately 9600 invisaligntrained doctors who had never submitted a single invisalign case although we want every doctor to achieve and maintain the proficiency requirements with invisalign we expect that a number of our lower volume doctors may choose not to meet these requirements as a result the proficiency requirements may result in greater variability among customer activity particularly in the second half of 2010 after the additional sixmonth qualification period expires on june 30 2010 if the number of our customers who fail to maintain andor increase utilization to meet the proficiency requirements is greater than we anticipate our case volumes will decrease and our revenues will be harmed in addition if gps and orthos do not attend our training courses in sufficient numbers for any reason including the introduction of the proficiency requirements or continued weakness in general economic conditions our revenue may fail to grow as expected in addition increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice if adoption and utilization does not increase as we anticipate our revenues may fail to grow as expected and our operating results may be harmed 

the frequency of use by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of invisalign by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products 

in response to challenges in our business including increased competition we have in the past reduced the list price of our products we also provide volume based discount programs to our doctors in addition we sell a number of products at different list prices if we introduce any price reductions expand our discount programs in the future if participation in these programs increases or if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or newer products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue our average selling price would be adversely affected and our revenues gross margin and net profits losses may be reduced furthermore although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 

if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our revenues while controlling our expenses while we generated positive operating cash flow in 2008 and in 2009 we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from operations from period to period in 

  

the future because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our 

  

expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products we launched invisalign teen in july 2008 and invisalign assist in october 2008 in october 2009 we introduced new and enhanced features in all invisalign products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to include functionality and features that address customer requirements the availability of thirdparty reimbursement of procedures using our new products the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration “fda” and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our revenues and operating profits could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our santa clara california facility we also carry out research and development at locations in san jose costa rica 

  

and moscow russia in addition our customercare accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in costa rica our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

training technicians to use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the digital treatment plan that forms the basis of clincheck takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely create clincheck treatment plans within the timeframe our customers expect any delay in clincheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished aligners to our customers such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters digital dental modeling processes and other manufacturing processes are all principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our customer facing operations are located in costa rica our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time in addition our 

  

headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our invisalign product competes directly against products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties a danaher corporation subsidiary and traditional braces manufactured by 3m’s unitek and dentsply international these manufacturers have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues volume growth net profit losses and stock price we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations revenues and operating results 

we are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results furthermore we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically clincheck and vip software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2009 we had 131 issued us patents 160 pending us patent applications and 60 issued foreign patents and 122 pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price see part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial 

  

reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by a single supplier we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process from a single source in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets as of december 31 2009 our north american sales organization consisted of 164 people of which 150 were direct sales representatives and 14 were sales administration internationally 

  

we had 45 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2009 we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our revenues may be harmed 

complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

  

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years there have been and continue to be proposals by the obama administration members of congress state governments regulators and thirdparty payors to control these costs and more generally to reform the us healthcare system in december 2010 the united states senate advanced legislation that included a marketshare based excise tax of approximately 2 billion annually on medical device manufacturers beginning in 2011 this legislation compares to a bill previously passed by the house of representatives that includes a 25 percent salesbased excise tax on medical device manufacturers beginning in 2013 at this point in the legislative process the differences between each version have not yet been reconciled we cannot predict whether legislation will be enacted the final form any legislation might take or the effects of such legislation these taxes if implemented would result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 

furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

 

  

  

 complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

  

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

we currently sell our products in europe asia pacific latin america and japan and may expand into other countries from time to time we do not know whether orthodontists gps and consumers outside our north american market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate in addition sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance historically class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities recently a securities class action suit was filed against us on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased our common stock between january 30 2007 and october 24 2007 while we believe the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves we could incur substantial legal fees and our management’s attention and resources may be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

  

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

 

  

  

 if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid shortterm fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector with the current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

we have adopted a shareholders rights’ plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders to date our board of directors has designated 200000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights’ plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions 

  

relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings in june 2009 the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica granted a twelve year extension of the tax incentives which were previously granted in 2002 under these incentives all of the income we earn in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2017 the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2009 because costa rica incurred a net loss in 2009 no tax benefit was realized from these incentives in 2009 in order to receive the benefit of the incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend consumer class action 

on may 18 2007 debra a weber filed a consumer class action lawsuit against us orthoclear inc and orthoclear holdings inc dba orthoclear inc in syracuse new york us district court the complaint alleges two causes of action against the orthoclear defendants and one cause of action against us for breach of contract the cause of action against us titled “breach of third party benefit contract” references our agreement to make invisalign treatment available to orthoclear patients alleging that we failed “to provide the promised treatment to plaintiff or any of the class members” 

on july 3 2007 we filed our answer to the complaint and asserted 17 affirmative defenses on july 20 2007 we filed a motion for summary judgment on the third cause of action the only cause of action alleged against us on august 24 2007 weber filed a motion for class certification on october 1 2007 we filed an opposition to the motion of class certification and we are currently awaiting rulings from the court orthoclear has filed a motion to dismiss the initial case management conference and all discovery has been stayed pending the court’s decision on the motion for class certification orthoclear’s motion to dismiss and our motion for summary judgment we believe the lawsuit to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 

securities litigation 

in august 2009 plaintiff charles wozniak filed a lawsuit against the company and our chief executive officer and president thomas m prescott “mr prescott” in district court for the northern district of california on behalf of a claimed class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased the common stock of 

  

align between january 30 2007 and october 24 2007 the complaint alleges that align and mr prescott violated section 10b of the securities exchange act of 1934 and that mr prescott violated section 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 specifically the complaint alleges that during the class period we failed to disclose that we had shifted the focus of our sales force to clearing backlog causing a significant decrease in the number of new case starts the court has recently selected a lead plaintiff we believe the lawsuit to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 

litigating claims of the types discussed in this annual report on form 10k whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

align technology inc designs manufactures and markets the invisalign system a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces we received the united states food and drug administration “fda” clearance to market invisalign in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 

each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient our invisalign full treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors’ treatment goals our invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten sets of aligners invisalign express treatment is intended to assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lowercost option for adult relapse cases for minor crowding and spacing or as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers invisalign teen is designed to meet the specific needs of the nonadult comprehensive or teen treatment market invisalign assist is intended to help newlytrained and lower volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice upon completion of an invisalign or noninvisalign treatment the patient may be prescribed our traditional retainer product or our vivera retainers a clear aligner set designed for ongoing retention 

our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the four key objectives driving product innovation and clinical effectiveness enhancing the customer experience generating consumer demand and expanding into international markets each of these four key objectives is described more fully in item i—business—business strategy of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by this reference in addition to whether we successfully execute our business strategy a number of other factors the most important of which are set forth below may affect our results in 2010 and beyond 

 

   

in october 2009 we updated the proficiency requirements in order to further support our customers through this significant change and provided a onetime additional six month qualification period for doctors who were unable to meet the proficiency requirements for 2009 but demonstrated a desire to continue using invisalign the additional six month qualification period stipulated that for those doctors who had at least one case start and at least one invisalign ce hour at the end of 2009 will be allowed to maintain their active invisalign provider status through june 30 2010 provided that they meet half of the annual proficiency requirements at least 5 case starts and 5 invisalign ce hours between january 1 and june 30 2010 doctors will still be responsible for meeting the total annual requirements of at least 10 case starts and 10 invisalign ce hours by the end of 2010 to qualify as providers for the following year 

doctors with zero case starts or zero invisalign ce hours at the end of 2009 were not eligible for the additional qualification period they will be able to continue treating inprogress cases but will not be able to submit new invisalign cases or use invisalign branding or marketing resources doctors can reactivate their provider status by retaking invisalign training and meeting the proficiency requirements 

as of january 2010 approximately 6400 doctors met the invisalign proficiency requirements and another 15800 doctors met the criteria for the additional sixmonth qualification period in 2009 we limited the account status of approximately 13400 doctors who did not meet either proficiency requirements or the additional qualification period requirements these doctors can continue treating and finishing in progress patients in addition we deactivated approximately 9600 invisaligntrained doctors who had never submitted a single invisalign case 

although approximately 15800 doctors met the criteria for the additional sixmonth qualification period the proficiency requirements may result in greater variability among customer activity particularly in the second half of 2010 after the additional sixmonth qualification period expires there can be no assurance on the number of doctors that ultimately meet the criteria for the additional sixmonth qualification period if the number of our customers who fail to maintain andor increase utilization to meet the additional qualification requirements on june 30 2010 is greater than expected our case volumes in the second half of 2010 will decrease and our revenues will be harmed we want every doctor to achieve and maintain the proficiency requirements with invisalign we expect however that a number of our lower volume doctors may choose not to meet these requirements in addition if gps and orthos do not attend our training courses in sufficient numbers for any reason including the introduction of the proficiency requirements or declining general economic conditions our revenue may fail to grow as expected 

 

   

 

 

 although utilization rates in the fourth quarter of 2009 for each of our ortho gp and international channels were higher than the same quarter last year we expect to see fluctuation in our utilization rates as practices adjust to the proficiency requirements as a result of the proficiency requirements we expect that in 2010 we will ship cases to fewer doctors each quarter compared to prior years this will likely result in greater variability in utilization rates particularly in the second half of 2010 after the additional qualification period expires due to this and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of utilization rates may not be as meaningful in 2010 

 

   

  

  

  

  

   

joint development marketing and sales agreement in connection with the settlement reached with ormco on august 16 2009 align and ormco entered into the joint development marketing and sales agreement pursuant to which the parties have agreed to an exclusive collaboration over the next seven years to jointly develop and commercialize a combination orthodontic treatment system involving the use of both align’s clear aligner system and ormco’s brackets and arch wire system which system will be capable of treating even the most complex orthodontic cases

case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by product for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 are as follows in thousands 

 

 total net revenues increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of revenue growth in our international and north american orthodontic channels and partially offset by a slight decline in north american gp revenues 

overall 2009 north american invisalign revenues were comparable to 2008 and reflect a full year impact of product mix shifting from invisalign full towards invisalign teen and invisalign assist both of which have higher amounts of deferred revenue than invisalign full additionally 2009 north american revenues also include the full year impact of north american price increases that were effective in the beginning of the year the north american orthodontic channel experienced an increase in revenue and case volume primarily driven by the full year availability of invisalign teen north american gp revenues declined in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of the product mix shift towards invisalign assist combined with an overall slightly lower case volume we believe that as a result of the economic downturn and continued economic uncertainty many gps focused their efforts on traditional dental procedures and as a result sales of invisalign to these customers were negatively impacted compared to 2008 depending on the customers’ adoption of these products our product mix may continue to gradually shift towards these newer products that have higher deferred revenues our international invisalign revenues grew in 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of increased invisalign full case volumes and was supplemented by a partial year impact of invisalign teen which was launched in march 2009 this increase was offset by unfavorable exchange rates 

total net revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of increased growth in our international invisalign revenue and our north american gp revenue 

net revenues from our north american invisalign orthodontic channel decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to decreased case volume and higher revenue deferrals related to new products introduced in 2008 partially offset by lower participation in volumebased discount program rebates net revenues from our north american invisalign gp channel increased due to higher case volume and lower participation in volumebased discount rebate programs the increase in our international invisalign revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 was predominately due to higher case volumes partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates and increased participation in volumebased discount programs 

other revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were lower in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a decreased number of doctors trained year over year other revenues were lower in 2008 compared to 2007 due to north american training discount programs 

for 2010 we expect our total net revenues to grow compared to 2009 primarily due to the expected increases in case volumes from both the north american and international invisalign channels quarterly revenues may be impacted by changes in product mix the levels of promotional discounts foreign exchange rates and other factors 

  

cost of revenues and gross margin in millions 

 

 cost of revenues includes salaries for staff involved in the production process the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process training costs and stockbased compensation expense 

gross margin improved slightly in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure continued improvement in operating efficiencies and the cost savings from the commencement of direct fabrication of our aligners partially offset by 62 million of amortization of prepaid royalties relating to the ormco litigation settlement 

gross margin improved in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure and improved operating efficiencies 

we believe that gross margin in 2010 will be higher than in 2009 due to an increase in revenue year over year as well as the cessation of the amortization of ormco prepaid royalties however with our relatively fixed manufacturing cost structure quarterly gross margin will fluctuate based on case volume and product mix additionally the levels of promotional discounts foreign exchange rates and several other factors can impact average selling prices revenues and gross margins 

sales and marketing in millions 

 

 sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation including travelrelated costs marketing personnelrelated costs media and advertising clinical education product marketing and stockbased compensation expense 

sales and marketing expense decreased during 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 48 million reduction in employeerelated costs as a result of the restructuring plans implemented in 2008 as well as lower marketing media and clinical education expenses of 15 million associated with our 2008 product launches these costs were partially offset by higher sales commission expenses of 43 million 

sales and marketing expense increased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher payrollrelated expenses of 70 million including stockbased compensation of 11 million as a result of the full year effect of additional headcount hired in the fourth quarter of 2007 we also incurred higher product marketing expenses of 90 million associated with our new product launches and commercialization professional marketing programs clinical education and media costs 

  

general and administrative in millions 

 

 general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel outside consulting services legal expenses and stockbased compensation expense 

general and administrative expenses decreased slightly during 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower outside services relating to legal fees of 25 million these costs were partially offset by higher payrollrelated costs 

general and administrative expenses increased during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher payrollrelated expenses of 45 million including increased stockbased compensation expense of 26 million resulting from additional headcount management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition legal and other professional fees were higher by 34 million compared to 2007 primarily due to a 16 million credit in 2007 from an insurance reimbursement we received associated with the orthoclear litigation 

research and development in millions 

 

 research and development expense includes the personnelrelated costs and outside consulting expenses associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products conducting clinical and postmarketing trials and stockbased compensation expense 

research and development expenses decrease in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower payrollrelated expenses of approximately 24 million as well as lower outside consulting expenses of approximately 10 million 

research and development expenses increased slightly in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to higher payrollrelated expenses including stockbased compensation as a result of increased headcount in the first half of 2008 partially offset by lower consulting fees 

restructurings in millions 

 

 during 2008 we announced restructuring plans in july and october to increase efficiencies across the organization and with the expectation of lowering the overall cost structure by approximately 35 million per quarter in july 2008 we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our full time headcount by 67 employees including a phasedconsolidation of order acquisition operations from our corporate headquarters in santa clara 

  

california to juarez mexico which was completed by the end of 2008 the october restructuring plan included a total reduction of 111 full time headcount in santa clara california by july 2009 when we moved our customer care accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations in santa clara california to our existing facilities in costa rica 

we incurred approximately 13 million during 2009 of cost related to severance and termination benefits where in 2008 we incurred approximately 62 million in restructuring expenses that included 07 million related to the acceleration of stock option vesting and 55 million related to severance and termination benefits 

litigation settlement in millions 

 

 on august 16 2009 we entered into a litigation settlement with ormco that ended all pending litigation between the parties and we agreed to make a cash payment of 132 million and issue a total of 76 million nonassessable shares of common stock the shares issued to danaher an affiliate of ormco may not be resold except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act or an available exemption from registration we are not obligated to affect any such registration prior to august 16 2010 the fair value of the unregistered shares was determined as of the market closing price on the dates the shares were issued less a 25 nonmarketability discount for a total value of 767 million including the cash payment the determination of the discount applied to the restricted stock is highly subjective and is based primarily on an analysis utilizing the blackscholes model to value a hypothetical put option to approximate the cost of hedging the restricted stock over the expected period of nonmarketability the table below provides for a sensitivity analysis if the discount rates were 1 and 5 higher or lower in thousands except percentages 

 

 the value attributed to past infringement claims was recorded as litigation settlement costs and was based on case shipments from september 9 2003 through august 16 2009 totaling 697 million which was recorded in operating expenses and 62 million was amortized to cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2009 the remaining 08 million will be amortized based on case shipments during first quarter of 2010 

see note 7 “ormco litigation settlement” for additional information about the settlement accounting 

patients first program and settlement costs in millions 

 

 as part of the orthoclear agreement in october 2006 orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide as a result most orthoclear 

  

patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the “patients first program” in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recorded an 83 million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program subsequently in the first quarter of 2007 we reduced our patients first program accrual by 18 million to reflect a reduction of our initial estimate to the number of cases actually received by the case submission deadline we shipped all patients first program cases by june 30 2007 there were no costs related to the patients first program in 2008 and 2009 

interest and other income expense net in millions 

 

 interest and other income expense net includes interest income earned on cash balances interest expense foreign currency translation gains and losses and other miscellaneous charges 

interest income net in 2009 decreased by 25 million compared to 2008 primarily due to lower returns on our investments interest rates for investments throughout the marketplace were lower due to the low federal funds rate established by the federal reserve during 2009 other expense net decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting increases in foreign exchange gains during 2009 

interest income net in 2008 decreased by 11 million compared to 2007 primarily due to lower average cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances resulting from the 500 million stock repurchase program and lower interest rates in 2008 we shifted our investments into more conservative instruments principally us government securities which bear lower interest rates we incurred no interest expense in 2008 compared to 2007 in 2007 we incurred interest expense on the outstanding balance of our line of credit during 2007 which was repaid during 2007 we had no outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 

provision for benefit from income taxes in millions 

 

 we recorded income tax benefits of 26 million and 630 million for 2009 and 2008 respectively and an income tax provision of 12 million for 2007 these represented effective tax rates of 77 3684 and 33 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 

we exercised significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth forecasted earnings and projected taxable income in determining the provision for income taxes and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future benefit from deferred tax assets at december 31 2008 based on an evaluation of the available positive and negative evidence we determined that most of our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards in making that determination we considered the historical and projected pretax operating profit excluding stockbased 

  

compensation as well as the cyclical nature of our business and the uncertainty as to the impact of new product launches specifically at december 31 2008 the company considered the following positive evidence 

 

  

 the company also considered the following negative evidence 

 

  

 we believe that the positive evidence is of sufficient quality and quantity to overcome the negative evidence and as a result we released our tax valuation allowance of 646 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 the remaining valuation allowance of approximately 62 million is related to capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2008 because we cannot forecast sufficient future capital gains or foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets these net operating loss carryforwards will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 

in february 2009 the california 20092010 budget legislation was signed into law one of the major components of this legislation is the ability to elect to apply a single sales factor apportionment for years beginning after january 1 2011 as a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor we are required to remeasure our deferred taxes taking into account the reversal pattern and the expected california tax rate under the elective single sales factor we have determined that by electing a single sales factor apportionment our deferred tax assets will decrease by approximately 06 million net of federal benefit the tax impact of 06 million has been recorded as a discrete item in the first quarter of 2009 

at december 31 2009 we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 1877 million for federal tax purposes and 681 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized these carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020 for federal purposes and 2011 for california purposes the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation’s tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes if an ownership change is determined to have occurred our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation however based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december 31 2009 and our current estimate of the annual limitation we do not expect our net operating loss carryforwards to be limited at december 31 2009 we had research credit carryforwards of approximately 44 million for federal purposes and 54 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 

financial accounting standard board “fasb” accounting standard codification “asc” 718 prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled 88 million as of december 31 2009 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 

we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from nonus operations as of december 31 2009 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales the proceeds of the sale of our common stock and from occasional borrowings under our available credit facility as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we had the following cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and shortterm investments in thousands 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 was 742 million resulting primarily from our net loss of 313 million adjusted for noncash items including the litigation settlement with ormco of 627 million and other noncash expenses totaling 281 million which included depreciation amortization of intangibles and stockbased compensation expense the 344 million increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the prior year was driven primarily by higher sales volume which also resulted in an increase in deferred revenue of 155 million due to increased sales of newer products that have higher deferred revenues 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 397 million resulting primarily from our net profit of 800 million and noncash items totaling 327 million which included depreciation amortization of intangibles option acceleration charges for terminated executives and stockbased compensation expense also included in noncash items was an asset impairment charge of 17 million relating to management’s decision to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management these increases were offset by the release of a noncash tax valuation allowance of 646 million on most of the deferred tax assets cash flows from operating activities also resulted from a 46 million increase in deferred revenue and a 09 million decrease in inventories these increases in cash flows were offset by an 80 increase in accounts receivable and a decrease of 61 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 528 million resulting primarily from our net income of 357 million and noncash items such as depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and amortization of intangibles totaling 256 million additionally a 27 million increase in accounts payable also contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities these increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by a 107 million increase in accounts receivable 

net cash used in investing activities was 16 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the primary driver was 72 million used for the purchase of property and equipment in 2009 compared 143 million in 2008 offset by 60 million of net maturities from marketable securities as compared to 129 million in 2008 although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 

net cash used in investing activities was 11 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and consisted of 143 million for the purchase of property and equipment offset by 129 million of net maturities of marketable securities 

net cash used in investing activities was 368 million for the year ended december 31 2007 which largely consisted of 299 million of net purchases of shortterm marketable securities and 74 million used for the purchase of capital assets 

net cash provided in financing activities was 68 million for the year ended december 31 2009 which resulted primarily from 81 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock these proceeds were partially offset from the tax benefit excess of sharedbased payments and taxes paid on vesting restricted stock units of 11 million 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 404 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and resulted primarily from our 501 million stock repurchase including commissions offset by 105 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock principally from exercises of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 

net cash provided by financing activities was 175 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and consisted of 290 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options this increase was partially offset by the repayment of 115 million against the outstanding balance on our line of credit net cash provided by financing activities was 277 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and consisted of 162 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options and 115 million in net borrowings from our line of credit 

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting restricted stock units “rsus” which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercise as a result we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods in addition because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2009 2008 and 2007 we paid 05 million 05 million and 04 million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers respectively 

on december 5 2008 we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank under this revolving line of credit we have 250 million of available borrowings with a maturity date of december 31 2010 this credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of 100 million as of december 31 2009 we had no outstanding borrowings and we were in compliance with the financial covenants of this credit facility 

on april 29 2008 we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program of up to 50 million during the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 47 million shares of common stock at an average price of 1076 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 501 million including commissions as of december 31 2008 we had completed repurchases under the stock repurchase authorization there were no stock repurchases in 2009 

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 

 

 on january 26 2010 we entered into an agreement for new corporate headquarters to lease approximately 129024 square feet in san jose california the lease agreement commences on the earlier of august 1 2010 or the date we first commence conducting business in the premises which is expected to be on or about june 28 2010 and will continue for an initial term of seven years and two months the lease agreement for our current office headquarters in santa clara california expires on june 30 2010 see note 20 “subsequent event” 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2009 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate 

  

operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred revenues are recognized from product sales net of discounts and rebates service revenues related to the training of dental professionals and staff on the invisalign treatment processes are recorded when the services are completed 

we enter into arrangements that involve multiple future deliverables included in the price of invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist we offer case refinement which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient’s teeth to the desired final position case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement deliverable and recognize the residual revenue upon shipment we defer the fair value of case refinement upon shipment based on a breakage factor which is determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement usage actual usage rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue 

revenues are deferred for certain products that include staged delivery depending on the product revenues are recognized based on usage case completion ratably over a delivery period or upon shipment of the final staged shipment invisalign teen which includes up to six replacement aligners is delivered in a single shipment except for the replacement aligners currently the revenue for invisalign teen is recognized upon shipment except for the six replacement aligners for which the fair market value is 100 percent deferred and recognized as the replacement aligners are shipped or when the case is completed although invisalign teen has been available since july 2008 we do not have sufficient evidence to support a usage rate less than 100 percent for the six replacement aligners at this time however we are continually gathering and evaluating our historical experience if and when we gather sufficient historical experience to support a usage rate for the six replacement aligners less than 100 percent we would adjust our deferred revenue balance to the estimated usage rate and prospectively apply this rate to future invisalign teen shipments the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized ratably over the one year delivery period for invisalign assist when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages for these cases revenue is deferred upon the first staged shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment 

  

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

stockbased compensation expense 

we recognize stockbased compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award net of an estimated forfeiture rate we estimate the fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term and stock price volatility in addition judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent management’s best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future see note 11 “stockholders’ equity” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

longlived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets 

longlived assets including intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of 17 million which was recorded in general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 no intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented 

deferred tax valuation allowance 

we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2008 with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards we determined that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would be realized accordingly we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of 646 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

as of december 31 2009 we believed that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be realized however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are in fixedrate shortterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 200 million invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2009 and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 

currency rate risk 

we operate in north america europe asiapacific costa rica and japan as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries’ operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions the impact of an aggregate decline of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material 

prior to january 1 2007 the functional currency of align and our subsidiaries was the us dollar and accordingly gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euros costa rican colones and other currencies were reflected in other income expense during the first quarter of 2007 we analyzed the various economic factors of our international subsidiaries and determined that there had been a significant change in facts and circumstances to warrant a change in the functional currency for some of our european subsidiaries from the us dollar to the local currency effective january 1 2007 the adjustment from translating certain european subsidiaries’ financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar was recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net in the stockholder’s equity section of our consolidated balance sheets

 item 1 business 

our company 

align technology inc designs manufactures and markets the invisalign system a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces we received the united states food and drug administration fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 

we distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist or gp orthodontists and gps must complete an invisalign training course in order to provide the invisalign treatment solution to their patients the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asia pacific latin america and japan we use a distributor model for the sale of our products in parts of the asia pacific and latin american region 

we were incorporated in delaware in april 1997 our headquarters are located at 881 martin avenue santa clara california 95050 and our telephone number is 4084701000 

industry background 

malocclusion 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting over 195 million individuals or approximately 65 of the us population approximately 21 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with traditional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek treatment 

traditional orthodontic treatment 

in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patients teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices 

the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patients condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patients teeth with cement and attach an arch wire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patients teeth to achieve desired tooth movement because of the length of time between visits the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patients teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us 3500 to 7000 with a median fee of approximately 5000 generally only a portion of the fee is reimbursed by insurance in addition dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professionals estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professionals estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time and reduced profitability for the dental professional 

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment 

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages traditional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

• unattractive appearance braces call attention to the patients condition and treatment in addition braces trap food which can further compromise appearance braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth many adults associate braces with adolescence as a result of these and other limitations relatively few adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually • oral discomfort braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth the tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit 4 

• poor oral hygiene braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more difficult to brush and floss these problems can result in tooth decay and periodontal damage additionally the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth • inability to project treatment historically dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment accordingly dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment as a result they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits this lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professionals ability to estimate the duration of treatment because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental professional • physical demands on dental professional the manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional • root resorption the sustained high levels of force associated with traditional treatment can result in root resorption which is a shortening of tooth roots this shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient • emergencies at times braces need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability 

the align solution 

invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion the invisalign system is comprised of several phases the principal steps of which are the creation of digital treatment plans using proprietary software known as clincheck and the manufacturing of customized invisalign aligners 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches xrays of the patients dentition photographs of the patient a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patients upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form or prescription the impression is a critical component of the invisalign system as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patients teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models and subsequent molds and aligners an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patients teeth the prescription is also a critical component of the invisalign system describing the desired positions and movement of the patients teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our facility in juarez mexico manufacturing services are currently provided by international manufacturing solutions operaciones srl or ims a third party shelter services provider in juarez mexico on december 22 2008 we notified ims of our intention to terminate this shelter services arrangement effective april 2009 at that time we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in juarez mexico 

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patients initial malocclusion upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patients dentition using computed 

tomography known as ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patients current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professionals prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in san jose costa rica 

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a proposed customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulated treatment plan called clincheck is an internally developed and proprietary computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients this clincheck simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon completion of the review the patients clincheck is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via virtual invisalign practice vip our proprietary customer interfacing software portal which is available on our websites located at wwwinvisaligncom and wwwaligntechcom  the dental professional then reviews the clincheck and can either accept the proposed treatment or request modifications and adjustments until satisfied with the treatment plan clincheck allows the dental professional to view this threedimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly clincheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to view the clincheck treatment plan allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professionals final approval of the proposed clincheck treatment engages us to manufacture the corresponding molds and aligners 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment upon the dental professionals approval of the clincheck simulation we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patients teeth each mold is a replica of the patients teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment ims currently manufactures the molds and then uses these molds to fabricate the patients aligners as stated above in april 2009 we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in juarez mexico 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional from these molds aligners are fabricated by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are custommanufactured thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck each aligner covers a patients teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment simulation after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series advancing the teeth movement with each aligner stage this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete when treating with invisalign full invisalign express and invisalign teen aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment for invisalign assist aligners are manufactured in batches based on a progress tracking feature integrated into invisalign assist when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with toothcolored attachments bonded to the patients teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement in certain cases we provide an alignerlike template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patients teeth also in cases where interproximal reduction or ipr is 

requested by the dental professional we provide an ipr treatment form quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction location and timing of ipr 

retention upon completion of the treatment the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product new vivera retainers are shipped every three months over the one year period 

our products 

our revenues are generated from the sale of the following product offerings 

invisalign full commercial sales of invisalign full commenced in the us in july 1999 our traditional invisalign full is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and will consist of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors treatment goals for invisalign full aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment in fiscal 2008 approximately 85 of our net revenues were generated by the sale of invisalign full 

invisalign express in the third quarter of 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex orthodontic cases invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten sets of aligners invisalign express is intended to help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic treatment by providing a lowercost option for adult relapse cases for minor crowding and spacing or as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers for invisalign express aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 

retention in addition to our traditional single retainer product in january 2008 we launched vivera retainers where we deliver a new replacement retainer to orthodontic patients every three months for one year vivera retainers are produced using the same proprietary technology and material as the invisalign aligners and offer an effective aesthetic retention solution for both invisalign and noninvisalign patients 

invisalign teen in july 2008 we launched invisalign teen to meet the specific needs of the nonadult comprehensive or teen treatment market invisalign teen includes features such as an aligner wear indicator to help gauge patient compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address lingual root control issues and the natural eruption of key teeth common in teen patients predominantly marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients these features are intended to meet the treatment needs of those younger patients as part of invisalign teen we include up to six free individual replacement aligners during active treatment to cover potential aligner loss for invisalign teen aligners other than the replacement aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 

invisalign assist in october 2008 we launched invisalign assist invisalign assist is designed specifically for gps who want an integrated approach to selecting monitoring and finishing invisalign cases intended to help newlytrained and low volume gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice invisalign assist is intended to make it easier for gps to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach submit cases more efficiently and manage appointments with suggested tasks in addition new progress tracking features allow gps to submit new impressions every nine stages when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages we believe invisalign assist will help gps increase their confidence in prescribing invisalign treatment 

proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck and vip virtual invisalign practice are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue 

ancillary and other the remaining net revenues are generated by training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 

benefits of invisalign 

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to traditional braces 

benefits to the dental professional 

• ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes clincheck enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely outcome of treatment in an interactive threedimensional computer model clincheck allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient • begin using invisalign with minimal additional training the biomechanical principles that underlie treatment with the invisalign system are consistent with those of traditional orthodontics dental professionals can complete our initial training in one day we provide additional clinical support following the initial training and encourage dental professionals to attend continuing education classes seminars and workshops • expanded patient base we believe that invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics currently approximately 21 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us as of december 31 2008 our share of the 21 million case starts is approximately 3 percent our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces adults who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment will be more likely to seek treatment we therefore believe that invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment in addition as the primary care provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base • practice productivity we believe that as dental professionals move to a higher volume of invisalign patients they will be able to better leverage their existing resources including staff time and office space resulting in an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity benefits to the patient 

• excellent aesthetics aligners are nearly invisible when worn significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with traditional braces • comfort by replacing the sixweek adjustment cycle of traditional braces with twoweek stages aligners move teeth more gently also aligners are thin smooth and low in profile as a result aligners are more comfortable and less abrasive than traditional braces 8 

• improved oral hygiene patients can remove aligners for tasks that are difficult with traditional braces such as eating brushing and flossing we believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal damage during treatment which may result from traditional braces • potentially reduced overall treatment time aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth in addition the clincheck simulation from which aligners are produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements together these factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to traditional braces • potentially reduced root resorption we believe that controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption which is the breakdown or destruction of root structure • reduced incidence of emergencies typically a lost or broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in the treatment series minimizing inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of traditional braces

in some instances the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to traditional treatment aligners cost more to produce than traditional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in traditional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional and the treatment selected the cost of invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for traditional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there is generally a turnaround time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with traditional braces for optimal results in addition because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech in some instances patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have occurred we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 

our target market and patient base 

approximately 21 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us of which approximately 12 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign—our served market twentysix percent of these patients or approximately 300 thousand have mature dentition adults and older teens with fullyerupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth seventyfour percent or approximately 850 thousand have erupting dentition nonadult comprehensive or younger teens with partiallyerupted second molars cuspid and second bicuspid teeth as of december 31 2008 our share of the 21 million case starts is approximately 3 and approximately 6 of the 12 million patients of our served market 

our market research indicates that the majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces adults who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment will be more likely to seek treatment and therefore represent our most immediate market expansion opportunity with the launch of invisalign teen in july 

2008 we now offer a product designed to meet the needs of the nonadult comprehensive or younger teen treatment market even though we have not previously marketed our product to treat younger patients approximately 18 of our total case starts since 2007 were with individuals younger than 19 launching invisalign teen makes our treatment more applicable to an orthodontists patient base which we believe will provide us the opportunity to increase our penetration into and our share of the teen treatment market 

published market data for gps providing treatment for malocclusion is limited however as the primary care provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base we believe gps represent a significant market expansion opportunity 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 944000 patients worldwide have started treatment using invisalign the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asia pacific latin america and japan international sales accounted for 21 17 and 16 of our net revenues in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in note 17 segments and geographic information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we operate as one reportable segment—the design development manufacturing and marketing of invisalign a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth 

no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total net revenues in 2008 2007 and 2006 

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the following four key objectives driving product innovation enhancing the customer experience generating consumer demand and expanding our international markets 

product innovation and enhancements to existing products we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future longterm goal to drive and sustain product adoption until 2008 the invisalign system was a single offering used by our primary channels—gps and orthodontists—each with distinct and separate needs in 2008 we launched additional products to better meet those distinct needs specifically orthodontists want a more robust set of tools for greater predictability wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system on the other hand typical gps want greater ease of use more efficient and simplified diagnostic tools guidance through the case setup process minimal treatment intervention and selfhelp tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion based on this knowledge in july 2008 we announced the release of invisalign teen predominantly marketed to the orthodontist in october 2008 we announced the release of invisalign assist predominantly marketed to the gp 

with the introduction of invisalign teen our invisalign product family now includes a product designed to meet the specific needs of the nonadult comprehensive or younger teen market invisalign teen features include an aligner wear indicator to help gauge patient compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address the natural eruption of key teeth and lingual root control predominantly marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients these features make it easier and more efficient for orthodontists to treat those younger patients the launch of a teenspecific product makes the invisalign system more applicable to an orthodontists patient base which we believe will increase our penetration into and our share of the teen treatment market over time we expect that orthodontists will adopt invisalign teen slowly after they experience multiple successful treatment outcomes as a result we anticipate that invisalign teen volume may increase gradually and will not constitute a significant portion of our total product mix in the nearterm 

our most recently launched product invisalign assist is intended to help newlytrained and low volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice invisalign assist features are intended to make it easier for doctors to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach in addition gps can plan and submit cases efficiently manage appointments with suggested tasks and receive batch shipments of aligners based on treatment progress we believe invisalign assist will help gps increase their confidence in prescribing invisalign treatment 

we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase adoption of invisalign the recent launch of invisalign teen and invisalign assist and other future products will rely on new features tools and delivery options to meet specific clinical demands while providing a family of endtoend solutions for our customers enhanced product performance and innovation should continue to drive the adoption and frequency of use what we call utilization although we believe new product introduction to be a cornerstone to our future longterm growth we expect that adoption of these new products will increase gradually over a number of years 

enhancing the customer experience we are committed to enhancing the customer experience by focusing on specific customer touch points or areas where we interact directly with our customers specifically we are focused on improving our preselection process in order to attract new doctors that are motivated to become invisalign providers and committed to making invisalign a key part of their practices and strengthening our training programs in order to increase the rate that these newly trained customers submit invisalign cases as well as increase the rate that they move up the adoption curve to ultimately become leading invisalign providers or what we call promoters 

• improving training programs increasing the number of invisalign trained doctors and ensuring that these doctors are confident in using the invisalign system is a key driver toward our ultimate goal of increasing product adoption we continuously update our training programs to address the needs of our customers for instance we developed a pretraining course intended to familiarize doctors with the invisalign system prior to attending the full training course in addition we recently updated our initial training program by focusing on invisalign assist instead of invisalign full since we believe invisalign assist is the right product for newly trained gps we anticipate that by using invisalign assist newly trained gps will exit this initial training program with increased confidence in prescribing invisalign treatment we have also incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of 38 university programs by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option • moving from invisalign provider to a leading invisalign provider once a doctor is trained our goal is to assist the doctor to move up the adoption curve to ultimately become a leading invisalign provider or a promoter in order to increase the number of invisalign promoters we provide additional services to help our customers increase their confidence in using the invisalign system through continuing education and clinical support as well as improving their practice management skills in early 2008 we announced the introduction of the aligntech institute program  wwwaligntechinstitutecom  which is an interactive website that provides clinical education and practice development training these clinical education and practice development training opportunities include instructorled training classes seminars and workshops conference calls webbased videos case studies and other clinical resources many of these courses and resources are eligible for continuing education ce credits additionally our vip portal virtual invisalign practice provides our trained doctors and their staff access to thousands of invisalign cases and best practices as well as uptodate support information programs and marketing materials for continuous support and information access lastly as trained invisalign 11 

providers grow their case starts with invisalign programs such as the advantage program provide tiered benefits including volume rebates dedicated clinical support and a premium website position on the invisalign doctor locator website to those leading providers by participating in these programs and the various events and educational offerings we believe that our customers will emerge with a better understanding of the product and its applicability and with a greater aptitude for starting and finishing invisalign cases successfully 

consumer demand generation for invisalign marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving longterm growth our market research indicates that the majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to increase the number of patients who seek treatment using invisalign historically our marketing programs have been directed to an adult audience however with the introduction of invisalign teen we will for the first time direct our communication efforts directly to teens and their parents despite the continuing challenges in the us economy and weak consumer spending we believe that consumer demand creation is a key component to our longterm growth as a result we will continue to invest in efforts to increase consumer awareness of invisalign through a variety of media outlets we will continue to drive consumer demand among the adult population through our traditional tv advertising as well as digital online media in 2009 we will focus our efforts on the introduction of a new public relations program for invisalign teen intended to access print tv and online media we also have a teen specific website and will increasingly leverage widgets social media and blogs to directly target teens 

growth of international markets we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in our key international markets europe and japan similar to the domestic market our objective internationally is to increase the number of doctors that are motivated to becoming an invisalign provider and committed to making invisalign a key part of their practices through december 31 2008 we have trained over 14000 doctors predominantly orthodontists in core europe our primary international market product line expansion is key to providing doctors a solution that addresses a wider range of potential patient needs with greater treatment flexibility in october 2008 we launched invisalign express in europe expanding our international product offerings in europe the vast majority of orthodontic case starts are children and teens with the introduction of invisalign teen in europe planned for mid2009 we expect the addressable market for our product to expand and ultimately increase adoption in addition we will carry on our efforts to increase brand awareness and consumer demand in europe by continuing our consumer advertising campaign that was first launched in march 2007 additionally although the vast majority of our international revenues are from direct sales approximately 9 of our international sales are through distributors covering smaller international markets specifically asia pacific and latin america we will consider selling through distributors in other smaller or less strategic markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a casebycase basis with these efforts we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future in 2008 our international sales increased from 17 of net revenues to 21 of net revenues an increase of approximately 34 

manufacturing 

to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 

manufacturing administration is located in santa clara california however our manufacturing facilities are located outside of the us in san jose costa rica and juarez mexico as of 

december 31 2008 our manufacturing and operations staff in the us and costa rica consisted of 747 people at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans upon acceptance of the treatment plan by the dental professional these plans are then transmitted electronically to juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture sla stereolithography aligner molds our order acquisition operations the manufacturing of aligner molds and aligners as well as the packaging and shipment of aligners are currently conducted by international manufacturing solutions operaciones srl or ims a third party shelter services provider in juarez mexico on december 22 2008 we notified ims of our intention to terminate ims shelter services arrangement effective april 2009 at that time we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in juarez mexico upon the completion of this transition we will directly employ approximately 500 people in mexico each of whom is currently employed by ims information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading risk factors 

we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 

throughput management 

because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continue to upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez mexico in order to scale our manufacturing capacity we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment 

quality assurance 

aligns quality system is in compliance with food  drug administrations medical device regulations 21cfr part 820 and health canadas medical device regulations we are certified to en iso 134852003 internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing and of the council of canada we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since we custom manufacture aligners on a buildtoorder basis we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck and each aligner is unique we inspect the product at various points during the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers expectations aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed in the event aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the 

purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patients dentition to us we use the impressions to create a new clincheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth 

sales and marketing 

we market invisalign by communicating invisaligns benefits to dental professionals through our training programs mail campaigns trade shows trade journals and print media and to consumers through a nationwide advertising campaign based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign in order to serve anticipated demand we continue to train a broad base of dental professionals 

professional marketing 

our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july 1999 in 2001 we began marketing invisalign to gps in our north american market as of december 31 2008 our north american sales organization consisted of 161 people of which 134 were direct sales representatives and 27 were sales administration and management internationally we had 41 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2008 we continually evaluate cost effective ways to support our customers in smaller markets for instance during 2007 we transitioned the sales of our products in part of the asia pacific and latin american regions to a distributor model we will consider selling through a distributor in other smaller markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a casebycase basis 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps in the us and canada which we consider our north american market and internationally as of december 31 2008 we had trained 55510 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those trained dental professionals approximately 74 are dental professionals in our north american market within our north american market we have trained 8670 orthodontists and 32660 gps cumulatively through the end of 2008 

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of our website 

after doctors complete their training sales representatives may follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases these practice development activities may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions treatment planning processes and familiarizing them with our dental online portals and tools sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

consumer marketing 

our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources 

• an orthodontist • a gp • consumer marketing and advertising • our website which can be accessed at either wwwinvisaligncom or wwwaligntechcom • directtoconsumer mail advertising and public relations efforts and • other invisalign patients in 2009 we expect higher marketing spending in europe with a focus on consumer advertising including television and print media to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors we will continue to incur additional costs related to commercialization and launch of new products to market in the united states and europe 

research and development 

our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines including the development of distinct product platforms for the gps and orthodontists such as invisalign assist and invisalign teen our research and development expenses were 262 million for 2008 257 million for 2007 and 185 million for 2006 

in an effort to demonstrate invisaligns broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process as mentioned in our business strategy we are making investments in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products to meet the needs of our customers and increase adoption and utilization of invisalign 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2008 we had 118 issued us patents 181 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications see item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading risk factors 

seasonal fluctuations 

seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected and are likely to continue to affect our business specifically our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases these seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the nature of our business we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which treatment data or a case is received until the acceptance of the digital treatment plan or clincheck is dependent on the dental professionals discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved clincheck our backlog consists of clincheckapproved cases which are generally shipped within a short period of time as a result we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future sales and our quarterly revenues depend largely on the timing of clincheck approvals and the impact on cases shipped in that quarter 

competition 

we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets which include 3m company sybron dental specialties and dentsply international inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign including the products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties a division of danaher corporation see item 3 legal proceedings for a summary of our litigation with ormco in the future we may face further competition from early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading risk factors 

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following 

• aesthetic appeal of the treatment method • effectiveness of treatment • customer support • comfort associated with the treatment method • oral hygiene • ease of use and • dental professionals chair time we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

fdas quality system regulation for medical devices the invisalign system is classified as a class ii medical device in 1998 we received premarket clearance from the fda pursuant to the 510k premarket notification procedure allowing us to market the product in the us the invisalign system was originally cleared for use by the fda in patients with permanent teeth and contraindicated the device for patients presenting with mixed dentition severe overbite severe overjet tooth malocclusion requiring surgical correction adolescent patients with a skeletally narrow jaw and adult patients with dental prostheticsimplants in 2008 the fda cleared new labeling for the invisalign system by removing the permanent dentition limitation from the indications for use in addition certain conditions previously listed as contraindications will now be listed as precautions we believe our invisalign system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the invisalign system our aligners are currently manufactured by ims a third party shelter services provider based in juarez mexico ims is registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturer and is certified to iso 134852003 under aligns quality management system we have also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes have been implemented at ims to comply with the fdas quality systems standards ims has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel in the manufacture and distribution of invisalign we and ims are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer on december 22 2008 we notified ims of our intention to terminate ims shelter services arrangement effective april 2009 at that time we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in juarez mexico 

if the fda determines that we or ims failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 

health canadas medical device regulations in canada we are required to comply with health canadas medical device regulations our products are registered with health canada we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada 

european unions mdd requirements  iso 134852003 in europe invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such we follow the requirements of the medical device directives we are iso 134852003 certified which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe 

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information although compliance is the responsibility of the hospital physician or other healthcare provider we understand the importance to our customers and their patients of maintaining the confidentiality of patient information accordingly we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do 

business or provide services to our patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements 

other federal and state laws as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business we are a medical device manufacturer subject to us food and drug administration regulations these regulations among other things require that we maintain device and facilities registrations and listings as well as promote our products as permitted by our fda clearances furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions under the federal antikickback statute prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws which are evolving at the federal and state levels are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we had 1394 employees including 747 in manufacturing and operations 339 in sales and marketing 137 in research and development and 171 in general and administrative functions we had 503 employees in north america 721 employees in costa rica 160 employees in europe and 10 employees in japan

 item 1a risk factors 

we have only recently returned to profitability if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

although we maintained profitability in 2008 if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our revenues while controlling our expenses while we generated positive operating cash flow in 2008 we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from operations from period to period in the future because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

• limited visibility into and difficulty predicting the level of activity in our customers practices from quarter to quarter • weakness in consumer spending as a result of the slowdown in the united states economy and global economies • changes in the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter which given our cycle time and the delay between case receipts and case shipments could have an impact on which quarter revenue can be recognized 20 

• changes in product mix • seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments • success of marketing programs from quarter to quarter • changes in the timing of when revenue is recognized as a result of the introduction of new products such as invisalign assist and invisalign teen • changes to our effective tax rate • unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity • any disruptions in the manufacturing process including unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes or natural or other disasters beyond our control • the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors • aggressive price competition from competitors • costs and expenditures in connection with litigation • inaccurate forecasting of revenues production and other operating costs and • investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to invisalign to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign for any reason including as a result of a decline in general economic conditions or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect revenues gross margin and net profits 

we expect that revenues from the sale of the invisalign system will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed factors that could cause adoption of invisalign at a lower rate than we expect as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 

  consumers may not adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued decline in general economic conditions 

consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the united states economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may among other things result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts or a reduction in the demand for invisalign generally either of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results in addition invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment we have generally received positive feedback from both orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics greater comfort and hygiene compared to traditional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products 

  orthodontists and gps may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

our success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the invisalign system by dental professionals what we refer to as utilization invisalign requires orthodontists gps and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways increasing adoption and cumulative use by orthodontists and gps will depend on factors such as the capability safety efficacy ease of use price quality and reliability of our products our ability to provide effective sales support training and service and the availability of competing products technologies and alternative treatments in addition unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and consequently reduced acceptance by dental professionals also increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice if adoption and utilization does not increase as we anticipate our revenues may fail to grow as expected and our operating results may be harmed 

  the frequency of use by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of invisalign by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

  we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products 

in response to challenges in our business including increased competition we have in the past reduced the list price of our products in addition we provide volume based discount programs to our doctors if we are to introduce any price reductions or expand our discount programs in the future or if participation in these programs increases our revenues gross margin and net profits losses may be adversely affected furthermore although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates as a result negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 

we may experience unexpected problems and expenses associated with the phasedrelocation of our customer facing organizations to costa rica 

in october 2008 we announced a restructuring plan to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower our overall cost structure in addition to headcount reduction the restructuring plan included the phasedrelocation of our customer care accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations currently located in santa clara california to our facility in costa rica we expect this relocation to be completed by the end of july 2009 this relocation is accompanied by a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our results of operations and statement of cash flows including 

• failure to successfully coordinate and phase the relocation of these customer facing organizations may cause our customers to experience decrease in service levels • the relocation may absorb significant management and key employee attention and resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing business operations • failure to retain key employees who possess specific knowledge or expertise and upon whom we are depending upon for the timely and successful transition to costa rica and • difficulties in hiring employees in costa rica with the necessary skills to perform these customer facing functions if any of these risks materialize in the future our operating results statement of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop manufacture market and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products we launched invisalign teen in july 2008 and invisalign assist in october 2008 there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to include functionality and features that address customer requirements the availability of thirdparty reimbursement of procedures using our new products the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 

a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our revenues or a reduction in our earnings 

we are dependent on commercial freight carriers primarily ups to deliver our products if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason we may be unable to deliver our products to 

our customers on a timely basis if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner our customers may reduce their orders from us and our revenues and operating profits could materially decline in a rising fuel cost environment our freight costs will increase if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of revenues our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans which are then transmitted electronically to the juarez mexico these digital files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds our order acquisition aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez mexico in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our santa clara california facility we also carry out research and development at locations in san jose costa rica and moscow russia in october 2008 we announced the phasedconsolidation of our customercare accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations which are currently located in santa clara california to our facility in costa rica we expect this relocation to be completed by the end of july 2009 our increasing reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

• difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations • difficulties in managing international operations • fluctuations in currency exchange rates • import and export license requirements and restrictions • controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process • political social and economic instability including as a result of increased levels of violence in juarez mexico • acts of terrorism and acts of war • interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services • product or material transportation delays or disruption • burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws • trade restrictions and changes in tariffs and • potential adverse tax consequences if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

we currently are transitioning from reliance on a shelter service arrangement to become a direct manufacturer of our products if we fail to successfully manage this transition our business may be harmed 

we currently rely on ims a third party shelter services provider located in juarez mexico for order acquisition to fabricate aligner molds as well as finished aligners and to ship the completed product to customers on december 22 2008 we announced the termination of our shelter services arrangement with ims effective april 1 2009 in addition to the risks related to international operations described in the risk factor above any difficulties encountered by us with respect to a transition from a third party shelter services arrangement to manufacture including difficulties hiring and retaining qualified personnel could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner which could harm our business in addition any delay in completing the transition could result in increased transition costs which could decrease the amount of expected savings 

a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

training technicians to use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the digital treatment plan that forms the basis of clincheck takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely create clincheck treatment plans within the timeframe our customers expect any delay in clincheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished aligners to our customers such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters clincheck setup and other manufacturing processes are all principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software we are also transitioning our customer facing operations from santa clara california to costa rica in addition our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in juarez mexico both costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners in addition our headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our invisalign product competes directly against products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties a danaher corporation subsidiary and traditional braces manufactured by 3m company and dentsply international these manufacturers have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive large consumer product companies may 

also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues volume growth net profit losses and stock price we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations revenues and operating results 

we are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results furthermore we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically clincheck and vip software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2008 we had 118 issued us patents 181 pending us patent applications and 47 issued foreign patents and 142 pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products during fiscal 2005 and 2006 requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto by a san francisco california law firm acting on behalf of an unnamed party and in some instances acting on behalf of orthoclear requesting reexamination of a number of our patents in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in addition litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price see part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an 

opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third partys patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by a single supplier we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process from a singlesource in addition technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of or increases in price for these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets as of december 31 2008 our north american sales organization consisted of 161 people of which 134 were direct sales representatives and 27 were sales administration and regional sales management internationally we had 41 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2008 we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our revenues may be harmed 

complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

• product design development manufacturing and testing • product labeling • product storage • premarket clearance or approval • advertising and promotion and • product sales and distribution our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

• warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties • repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products • operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production • refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products • withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and • criminal prosecution if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure or the failure of ims to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

• storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records • prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and • the marketing and advertising of our products 30 

complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

we currently sell our products in europe asia pacific latin america and japan and may expand into other countries from time to time we do not know whether orthodontists gps and consumers outside our north american market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate in addition sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting managements attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

• quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity • changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results • speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations • strategic actions by our competitors such as product announcements or acquisitions • announcements of technological innovations or new products by us our customers or competitors and • general economic market conditions 31 

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future we would incur substantial legal fees and our managements attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

• revenue recognition • accounting for sharebased payments and • accounting for income taxes if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid shortterm fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector with the current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

we have adopted a shareholders rights plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders to date our board of directors has designated 200000 shares as series a 

participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights plan 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 

various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings in addition we have negotiated tax incentives with the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica under these incentives all of the income we earn in costa rica during these eight to twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in 2010 the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for 2009 as a result of these incentives income taxes decreased by 13 million in 2008 in order to receive the benefit of the incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could have a negative impact on our operating results

 item 3 legal proceedings 

ormco 

on january 6 2003 ormco corporation ormco a division of sybron dental specialties a danaher corporation subsidiary filed suit against us in the united states district court for the central district orange county division asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 5683243 and 6244861 the complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief also in 2003 we counterclaimed for infringement of our us patent no 6398548 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of us patent no 6616444 and we filed an answer to ormcos first amended complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6616444 and for infringement of us patent no 6554611 

in connection with these claims in 2004 the court granted five motions for summary judgment that we filed first the court granted our motion for summary judgment of noninfringement finding that our invisalign system does not infringe any of the asserted ormco patents 5447432 5683243 6244861 and 6616444 second the court granted in part our motion for summary judgment of infringement finding that ormco and its subsidiary allesee orthodontic appliances inc aoa infringe certain but not all claims of our patents nos 6398548 and 6554611 through the manufacture and sale of red white  blue appliances third the court granted our motion for summary judgment of invalidity of ormcos asserted patents claims 5447432 5683243 6244861 and 6616444 as noted above the court earlier found that we do not infringe these patents in addition the court also denied ormcos and aoas motion for summary judgment seeking a finding of invalidity of our asserted patent claims 6398548 and 6554611 fourth the court granted our summary judgment motion that our asserted patent claims are not invalid based on the evidence currently before the court although the court granted that motion it reopened discovery on two additional invalidity arguments ormco and aoa asserted fifth the court also granted our summary judgment motion that our patents are not unenforceable and granted ormcos and aoas summary judgment motion that ormco and aoa did not willfully infringe our patents 

on february 24 2005 the court on further summary judgment confirmed the validity of all of the asserted claims of our 6554611 patent and two of the asserted claims of our 6398548 patent the court also found certain claims of our 6398548 patent to be invalid in view of prior use evidence on may 26 2005 the court issued a permanent injunction the permanent injunction to enjoin ormco and aoa from further infringement of claims 10 and 17 of our 6398548 patent and claims 13 and 7 of our 6554611 patent on may 31 2005 ormco and aoa filed a notice of appeal with the federal circuit from the permanent injunction 

there have been two appeals after the permanent injunction was entered ormco and aoa appealed that injunction and the orders of the district court on summary judgment on which the injunction was based in april 2006 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc issued a ruling declaring two out of a total of seventyone claims in our us patent no 6398548 and four out of a total of ten claims in us patent no 6554611 to be invalid as obvious the cafcs decision reverses the california district court summary judgment order of validity 

the 6398548 patent consists of 71 claims only claims 10 and 17 were at issue in the first appeal and cafc ruling these two claims are directed to a system of appliances and method of repositioning 

teeth from an initial to a final tooth arrangement where at least some of the appliances are marked to show order of use these claims contain further limitations requiring instructions as to the order in which the appliances are to be worn and use of the appliances in intervals of 220 days 

the 6554611 patent consists of ten claims directed to a system for repositioning teeth that includes one or more intermediate appliances and a final appliance provided in a single package as well as instructions which set forth the order in which the appliances are to be worn the cafcs ruling pertains only to claims 1 2 3 and 7 in the patent 

the second appeal was from the final judgment ormco appealed the ruling of the district court that 92 claims in four of its patents are not infringed by us and that the asserted claims are invalid we appealed the ruling of the district court that certain claims of our 6398548 patent which were found to be infringed by ormcos and aoas red white  blue appliances were invalid the cafc issued a ruling on august 24 2007 affirming the district courts ruling that 86 out of 92 claims in ormcos 5447432 5683243 6244861 and 6616444 patents are invalid and not infringed by us the cafc reversed the district courts noninfringement and invalidity rulings on six claims in ormcos 6616444 patent ormco filed a petition for review with the us supreme court with respect to the portion of the cafcs opinion that affirmed the district courts ruling of noninfringement and nonenablement of ormcos 86 claims the supreme court denied ormcos petition and the case on the six claims in ormcos 6616444 patent were returned to the district court for a determination of validity and infringement of those claims the district court issued orders construing the claim terms at issue and granting our motion to amend our answer and counterclaim to assert ormcos 6616444 patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct the parties are currently completing fact discovery 

on february 25 2009 the district court issued rulings on various summary judgment and expert related motions in summary the district court granted one of ormcos motions on one theory of infringement and granted our motion on two theories of noninfringement our invalidity argument supported by over fifty prior art references was unaffected the district court also ruled that one of our inequitable conduct theories should be resolved at trial a finding of inequitable conduct at trial could render the six claims at issue and possibly the family of ormco patents related to the 6616444 patent unenforceable 

trial on liability issues is scheduled for june 2 2009 despite the district courts ruling of infringement on one of ormcos theories if the jury finds ormcos six claims to be invalid or unenforceable there can be no liability for infringement we intend to vigorously pursue our invalidity and inequitable conduct counterclaims at trial 

other matters 

uspto 

during fiscal 2005 and 2006 requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto by a san francisco california law firm acting on behalf of an unnamed party requesting ex parte reexamination of our patents a reexamination certificate has been issued regarding the 6309215 6398548 6705863 6217325 6722880 6318994 and 5975893 patents and 

therefore these patents are no longer in reexamination we received an action closing prosecution on the 6685469 patent the status of the 6629840 patent is as follows 



as part of the orthoclear agreement orthoclear agreed to take no further action with respect to the inter parte requests including the 6629840 patent 

class action 

on may 18 2007 debra a weber filed a consumer class action lawsuit against us orthoclear inc and orthoclear holdings inc dba orthoclear inc in syracuse new york us district court the complaint alleges two causes of action against the orthoclear defendants and one cause of action against us for breach of contract the cause of action against us titled breach of third party benefit contract references our agreement to make invisalign treatment available to orthoclear patients alleging that we failed to provide the promised treatment to plaintiff or any of the class members 

on july 3 2007 we filed our answer to the complaint and asserted 17 affirmative defenses on july 20 2007 we filed a motion for summary judgment on the third cause of action the only cause of action alleged against us on august 24 2007 weber filed a motion for class certification on october 1 2007 we filed an opposition to the motion of class certification and we are currently awaiting rulings from the court orthoclear has filed a motion to dismiss the initial case management conference and all discovery has been stayed pending the courts decision on the motion for class certification orthoclears motion to dismiss and our motion for summary judgment 

litigating claims of the types discussed in this annual report on form 10k whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

align technology inc designs manufactures and markets the invisalign system a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces we received the united states food and drug administration fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 

each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient our invisalign full treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors treatment goals our invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten sets of aligners invisalign express treatment is intended to assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lowercost option for adult relapse cases for minor crowding and spacing or as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers invisalign teen which was launched in july 2008 is designed to meet the specific needs of the nonadult comprehensive or teen treatment market invisalign assist launched in october 2008 is intended to help newlytrained and low volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice upon completion of an invisalign or noninvisalign treatment the patient may be prescribed our traditional retainer product or our vivera retainers a clear aligner set designed for ongoing retention 

our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the four key objectives driving product innovation enhancing the customer experience generating consumer demand and expanding into international markets each of these four key objectives is described more fully in item i—business—business strategy of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by this reference in addition to whether we successfully execute our business strategy a number of other factors the most important of which are set forth below may affect our results during the remainder of 2009 and beyond 

• impact on consumer spending due to a decline in general economic conditions consumer spending habits are affected by among other things prevailing economic conditions levels of employment salaries and wage rates gas prices consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions a general slowdown in the united states economy and certain international economies as well as an uncertain economic outlook have adversely affected consumer spending habits as a result of the decline in general economic conditions we expect that our product volumes and revenues may decline in 2009 compared to 2008 in addition the decline in general economic conditions may further have the impact of decreasing the number of orthodontic case starts overall • utilization rates our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental 41 

professionals or utilization our quarterly utilization rates from the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 are as follows 

utilization rates 

utilization rates   of cases shipped divided by  of doctors cases were shipped to 

as set forth in the chart above year over year utilization rates declined slightly for our domestic channel in each quarter of 2008 compared to the same quarter in 2007 we believe that the continued economic slowdown has negatively impacted many of our north america customers international utilization rates for the same periods however increased slightly 

• impact of new products on deferred revenue we launched three new products in 2008 vivera retainers in january 2008 invisalign teen in july 2008 and invisalign assist in october 2008 as a result of and depending upon customer adoption of these new products we expect our mix of products to begin shifting gradually key features of these new products include staged delivery of retainers with vivera up to six free individual replacement aligners with invisalign teen and staged delivery of aligners with invisalign assist as a result of these features these new products will have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling prices compared to invisalign full the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and then recognized as each shipment occurs revenue for the six replacement aligners included in invisalign teen will be deferred based on their fair market value until the earlier of the replacement aligners being used or until the case is completed for invisalign assist when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages as a result for these cases revenue will be deferred upon the first staged shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment in addition included in the price of invisalign full treatment we offer case refinement which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patients teeth to the desired final position invisalign teen invisalign assist and invisalign full include a deferral for case refinement as these new products increase as a percentage of our total case volume deferred revenue on our balance sheet will increase 

• reliance on international manufacturing operations our manufacturing efficiency has been and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica dental technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare digital treatment plans we currently rely on ims a third party shelter services provider located in juarez mexico for order acquisition to fabricate aligner molds as well as finished 42 

aligners and to ship the completed product to customers on december 22 2008 we notified ims of our intention to terminate this shelter services arrangement effective in april 2009 at that time we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in juarez mexico our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of management to effectively manage these international operations including any difficulties encountered by us with respect to a transition from a third party shelter services arrangement to a direct manufacturer including difficulties hiring and retaining qualified personnel if our management fails in any of these respects we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue in addition even if we have case submissions we may not have a sufficient number of trained dental technicians in costa rica to create the clincheck treatments or if we are unable to ship our product to our customers on a timely basis our revenue will be delayed or lost which will cause our operating results to fluctuate see part i item 1a—risk factors for risks related to our international operations as well as risks related to transitioning from reliance on shelter service arrangement to independent manufacturer 

• seasonal fluctuations seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected and are likely to continue to affect our business specifically our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases these seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates • foreign exchange rates although the us dollar is our reporting currency a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk therefore both positive and negative movements in currency exchanges rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements • restructurings during 2008 we announced restructuring plans in july and october to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the overall cost structure in july 2008 we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our full time headcount by 67 employees including initiating a phasedconsolidation of order acquisition operations from our corporate headquarters in santa clara california to juarez mexico which was completed by the end of 2008 the october restructuring plan included a total reduction of 111 full time headcount in santa clara california by july 2009 as we create a new shared services organization in our existing costa rica facility that will consolidate customer care accounts receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations which are currently located in santa clara california we anticipate phasing the relocation to costa rica in an attempt to minimize disruptions to customer service levels and expect the relocation to be completed by the end of july 2009 these actions resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately 62 million in 2008 and we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 18 million over the first half of 2009 we expect to reinvest the annualized savings of these two restructurings in the execution of our key strategic initiatives see part i item 1a—risk factors for risks related to the october restructuring including the phasedrelocation of our customer facing operations to costa rica • review of our investment portfolio and policies our cash equivalent and shortterm investment portfolio as of the date of this form 10k consisted of us government notes and bonds corporate bonds and certificates of deposits agency bonds and discount notes and commercial paper we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor manage and 43 

limit our exposure to interest rate liquidity and credit risk the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes as a result of current adverse financial market conditions investments in some financial instruments such as structured investment vehicles subprime mortgagebacked securities and collateralized debt obligations may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns as of the date of this form 10k we had no direct holdings in these categories of investments and our indirect exposure to these financial instruments through our holdings in money market mutual funds was immaterial as of the date of this form 10k we had no impairment charge associated with our shortterm investment portfolio relating to such adverse financial market conditions although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired see part i item 1a—risk factors for risks related to global financial and securities markets 

our shortterm marketable securities as of december 31 2008 are as follows in thousands 



our longterm marketable securities as of december 31 2008 are as follows in thousands 



• tax valuation allowance we continually evaluate both the positive and negative evidence in assessing our need for a tax valuation allowance as a result of our analysis we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2008 • effective tax rate our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate these factors include but are not limited to changes in tax laws regulations andor rates changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings • stockbased compensation we implemented statement of financial accounting standards fas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment fas 123r in 2006 and we expect stockbased compensation to increase until at least 2010 which corresponds to our standard 4year vesting term thereafter new grants will be expensed over the vesting period however this expense may be offset by fully vested grants that are no longer expensed for the years 44 

ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 stockbased compensation expense recognized in accordance with fas 123r is as follows in thousands 



results of operations 

comparison of years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

net revenues 

invisalign product revenues by channel and other revenues which represent training and sales of ancillary products for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 are as follows 



case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by channel for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 are as follows 



total net revenues increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of increased growth in our international invisalign revenue and our north american gp revenue 

net revenues from our north american invisalign orthodontic channel decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to decreased case volume and higher revenue deferrals related to new products introduced in 2008 partially offset by lower participation in volumebased discount program rebates net revenues from our north american invisalign gp channel increased due to higher case volume and lower participation in volumebased discount rebate programs 

revenues from both our north american orthodontic and gp channels increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of an overall increase in case volume and a favorable product mix shift towards invisalign full this product mix shift towards invisalign full began in the fourth quarter of 2006 after we removed the cancellation fees on invisalign full cases prior to clincheck approval and clarified clinical protocols surrounding what is an appropriate invisalign express case the increase in invisalign full revenues is partially offset by increased participation in our volumebased discount programs 

the increase in our international invisalign revenues in 2008 compared to 2007 was predominantly due to higher case volumes partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates and increased participation in volumebased discount programs 

the increase in our international invisalign revenues in 2007 compared to 2006 was attributable to an increase in case volume additionally our international revenues benefited from favorable exchange rates in 2007 these increases were partially offset by increased participation in volumebased discount programs 

other revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were lower in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to north american training discount programs other revenues were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of an increased number of doctors trained year over year 

for 2009 we expect our total net revenues to decrease compared to 2008 primarily due to case volume decreases in north america partially offset by expected growth in international revenue we expect our mix of products to continue to shift in 2009 due to the introduction of new products during the second half of 2008 these new products have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling price compared to invisalign full 

cost of revenues and gross margin 



cost of revenues includes salaries for staff involved in the production process costs incurred by ims a third party shelter service provider in juarez mexico the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process training costs and stockbased compensation expense 

gross margin improved in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure and improved operating efficiencies 

gross margin improved in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of increased case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure resulting in decreases in our per unit standard cost additionally 

cost reductions from improved operating efficiencies also contributed to the increase in 2007 gross margin 

we believe that gross margin in 2009 will be slightly lower than in 2008 as we expect overall case volume to decrease year over year partially offset by a benefit from our transition from a third party shelter arrangement to direct manufacturing in juarez mexico effective april 2009 however with our relatively fixed manufacturing cost structure quarterly gross margin will fluctuate based on case volume and product mix in addition should we experience continuing unfavorable exchange rates our gross margin may be adversely affected 

sales and marketing 



sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation including travelrelated costs marketing personnelrelated costs media and advertising clinical education product marketing and stockbased compensation expense 

sales and marketing expense increased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher payrollrelated expenses of 70 million including stockbased compensation of 11 million as a result of the full year effect of additional headcount hired in the fourth quarter of 2007 we also incurred higher product marketing expenses of 90 million associated with our new product launches and commercialization professional marketing programs clinical education and media costs 

our sales and marketing expense increased during 2007 compared to 2006 predominantly as a result of a 103 million increase in media advertising and product marketing expenses and an increase in payrollrelated expenses of 51 million of which 37 million was attributable to additional headcount and 14 million to stockbased compensation 

we expect sales and marketing expense levels in 2009 to be comparable to 2008 in 2009 we expect to invest in our international channel including consumer advertising and sales force expansion and continue commercialization of new products in north america offset by benefits from the transition of our shared services organizations to costa rica beginning in the second half of 2009 

general and administrative 



general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel outside consulting services legal expenses and stockbased compensation expense 

general and administrative expenses increased during 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to higher payrollrelated expenses of 45 million including increased stockbased compensation expense of 26 million resulting from additional headcount management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition legal and other professional fees were 

higher by 34 million compared to 2007 primarily due to a 16 million credit in 2007 from an insurance reimbursement we received associated with the orthoclear litigation 

general and administrative expense decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 largely due to a 206 million decline in external legal fees following the settlement of the orthoclear litigation in the fourth quarter of 2006 as mentioned above our 2007 legal expense included a 16 million credit for an insurance reimbursement of legal costs also associated with the orthoclear litigation this decrease was partially offset by a 35 million increase in additional headcount and incentive compensation a 17 million increase in consulting fees and a 14 million increase in stockbased compensation expense additionally amortization expense increased 22 million in 2007 compared to 2006 related to the amortization of the noncompete agreements we received in connection with the orthoclear settlement 

we expect general and administrative expense in 2009 to be lower than 2008 levels as we begin to benefit from the transition of our shared services organizations to costa rica beginning in the second half of 2009 

research and development 



research and development expense includes the personnelrelated costs and outside consulting expenses associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products conducting clinical and postmarketing trials and stockbased compensation expense 

research and development expenses increased slightly in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 primarily due to higher payrollrelated expenses including stockbased compensation as a result of increased headcount in the first half of 2008 partially offset by lower consulting fees 

research and development expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 predominantly from a 50 million increase resulting from higher headcount and incentive compensation additionally a 15 million increase in outside services also contributed to the increase in 2007 research and development costs 

we expect research and development expense in 2009 to be lower than 2008 levels as a result of lower headcount and reduced consulting expenses 

restructurings 



during 2008 we announced restructuring plans in july and october to increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the overall cost structure in july 2008 we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce our full time headcount by 67 employees including a phasedconsolidation of order acquisition operations from our corporate headquarters in santa clara california to juarez mexico which was completed by the end of 2008 the october restructuring plan included a total reduction of 111 full time headcount in santa clara california by july 2009 as we move customer care accounts 

receivable credit and collections and customer event registration organizations in santa clara california to our existing facilities in costa rica 

in 2008 we incurred approximately 62 million in restructuring expenses relating to these actions which includes 07 million related to the acceleration of stock option vesting and 55 million related to severance and termination benefits of which 30 million was paid during the year 

we are phasing in the relocation to costa rica of our shared services group in an attempt to minimize disruptions to customer service levels and expect the relocation to be completed by july 2009 we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately 18 million during the first half of 2009

as part of the orthoclear agreement in october 2006 orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide as a result most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the patients first program in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recorded an 83 million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program subsequently in the first quarter of 2007 we reduced our patients first program accrual by 18 million to reflect a reduction of our initial estimate to the number of cases actually received by the case submission deadline we shipped all patients first program cases by june 30 2007 

we paid 200 million to orthoclear during the fourth quarter of 2006 in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement of which 140 million was capitalized on our balance sheet representing the fair value of the noncompete agreements and is being amortized over 5 years in accordance with emerging issues task force 0401 accounting for preexisting contractual relationships between the parties to a purchase business combination eitf 0401 we recorded the remaining 60 million as settlement costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

interest and other income expense net 



interest and other income expense net includes interest income earned on cash balances interest expense on debt foreign currency translation gains and losses and other miscellaneous charges 

interest income net in 2008 decreased by 11 million compared to 2007 primarily due to lower average cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances resulting from the 500 million stock repurchase program and lower interest rates in 2008 we shifted our investments into more conservative instruments principally us government securities which bear lower interest rates we incurred no interest expense in 2008 compared to 2007 in 2007 we incurred interest expense on the outstanding balance of our line of credit during 2007 which was repaid during 2007 we had no outstanding borrowings as of december 31 2008 

other income expense net increased in 2008 compared to 2007 reflecting increases in foreign currency translation losses 

interest income net increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to higher average cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2007 

other income expense net decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 reflecting the decrease in foreign currency translation gains in january 2007 we began to record the adjustments from translating certain european subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar as a separate component of shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the heading currency rate risk for additional information on the change in functional currency 

provision for benefit from income taxes 



we recorded an income tax benefit of 630 million for 2008 and income tax provisions of 12 million and 08 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively these represented effective tax rates of 3684 33 and 24 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction we exercised significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth forecasted earnings and projected taxable income in determining the provision for income taxes and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future benefit from deferred tax assets at december 31 2008 based on available positive evidence we determined that most of our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as we cannot forecast sufficient future capital gains or foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets therefore we recorded a tax valuation allowance release of 646 million in 2008 the remaining valuation allowance of approximately 62 million relating to capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december 31 2008 will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 

at december 31 2008 we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 1911 million for federal tax purposes and 681 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized these carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020 for federal purposes and 2010 for california purposes fas 123r prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled 75 million as of december 31 2008 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes 

payable the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporations tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes if an ownership change is determined to have occurred our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation however based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december 31 2008 and our current estimate of the annual limitation we do not expect our net operating loss carryforwards to be limited at december 31 2008 we had research credit carryforwards of approximately 35 million for federal purposes and 43 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 

we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december 31 2008 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales the proceeds of the sale of our common stock and from occasional borrowings under our available credit facility as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we had the following cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and shortterm investments 



net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2008 was 397 million resulting primarily from our net profit of 800 million and noncash items totaling 327 million which included depreciation amortization of intangibles option acceleration charges for terminated executives and stockbased compensation expense also included in noncash items was an asset impairment charge of 17 million relating to managements decision to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management these increases were offset by the release of a noncash tax valuation allowance of 646 million on most of the deferred tax assets cash flows from operating activities also resulted from a 46 million increase in deferred revenue and a 09 million decrease in inventories these increases in cash flows were offset by an 80 increase in accounts receivable and a decrease of 61 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2007 was 528 million resulting primarily from our net income of 357 million and noncash items such as depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and amortization of intangibles totaling 256 million additionally a 27 million increase in accounts payable also contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities these increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by a 107 million increase in accounts receivable 

net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 140 million resulting primarily from our net loss of 350 million and noncash items such as depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and amortization of intangibles totaling 192 million additionally a 64 million increase in current assets and a 58 million reduction in deferred revenue partially offset by a 143 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the cash used in operating activities the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to the 

68 million accrual as of december 31 2006 for the anticipated costs of completing the patients first program 

net cash used in investing activities was 11 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and consisted of 143 million for the purchase of property and equipment offset by 129 million of net maturities of marketable securities as a result of current adverse financial market conditions investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 

net cash used in investing activities was 368 million for the year ended december 31 2007 which largely consisted of 299 million of net purchases of shortterm marketable securities and 74 million used for the purchase of capital assets 

net cash used in investing activities was 328 million for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to a 140 million purchase of intangible assets resulting from the orthoclear agreement 100 million for the purchase of capital assets and 89 million for net purchases of shortterm marketable securities 

net cash used in financing activities was 404 million for the year ended december 31 2008 and resulted primarily from our 501 million stock repurchase including commissions offset by 105 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock principally from exercises of employee stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 

net cash provided by financing activities was 175 million for the year ended december 31 2007 and consisted of 290 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options this increase was partially offset by the repayment of 115 million against the outstanding balance on our line of credit net cash provided by financing activities was 277 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and consisted of 162 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options and 115 million in net borrowings from our line of credit 

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting restricted stock units rsus which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercise as a result we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods in addition because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2008 and 2007 we paid 05 million and 04 million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers 

on december 5 2008 we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank under this revolving line of credit we have 250 million of available borrowings with a maturity date of december 31 2010 this credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of 100 million as of december 31 2008 we had no outstanding borrowings and we were in compliance with the financial covenant of this credit facility 

on april 29 2008 we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program of up to 50 million during the year ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 47 million shares of common stock at an average price of 1076 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 501 million including commissions as of december 31 2008 we had completed repurchases under the stock repurchase authorization 

contractual obligationsoff balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 



in july 2008 we entered into an agreement in favor of and for the benefit of elamex de juarez sa de cv or elamex landlord to ims our third party shelter services provider under this agreement we guarantee ims lease payments for its facility located in juarez mexico the monthly rent for this 68000 square foot facility is 30000 and the lease expires in july 2013 pursuant to the guarantee we are obligated to pay elamex for any rental payments in default by ims during the year ended december 31 2008 there were no rental payment defaults by ims 

on december 22 2008 we notified ims of our intention to terminate ims shelter services arrangement effective april 2009 at that time we will become a direct manufacturer of our clear aligners at the facility in juarez mexico and we will also assume ims lease with elamex 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2008 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 revenue recognition sab 104 and emerging issues task force eitf no 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 0021 sab 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 

revenues are recognized from product sales net of discounts and rebates service revenues related to the training of dental professionals and staff on the invisalign treatment process are recorded when the services are completed 

we enter into arrangements that involve multiple product deliveries in the future included in the price of invisalign full invisalign teen and invisalign assist we offer case refinement which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patients teeth to the desired final position case refinement may be elected by the dental professional in the last stages of orthodontic treatment we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement deliverable and recognize the residual revenue upon shipment we defer the fair value of case refinement upon shipment based on a breakage factor which is determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement utilization we believe that the use of a breakage factor is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of case refinement utilization since case refinement was first offered actual utilization rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue 

revenues are deferred for certain products that include staged delivery depending on the product revenues are recognized based on usage case completion ratably over a delivery period or upon shipment of the final staged shipment revenue for the six replacement aligners included in invisalign teen is deferred based on the fair market value until the earlier of replacement aligners being used or until the case is completed the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized ratably over the one year delivery period for invisalign assist when the progress tracking feature is selected aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages for these cases revenue is deferred upon the first staged shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment 

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

stockbased compensation expense 

we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment fas 123r in 2006 accordingly we recognize compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award net of an estimated forfeiture rate we estimate the fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the options expected term and stock price volatility in addition judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future prior to fas 123r adoption we accounted for sharebased payment awards under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to 

employees apb 25 and its related interpretations see note 10 stockholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

longlived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets 

longlived assets including intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization longlived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets fas 144 we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of 17 million which was recorded in general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of 2008 no intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented 

deferred tax valuation allowance 

we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2008 with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards we determined that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would be realized accordingly we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of 646 million for the year ended december 31 2008 

as of december 31 2008 we believed that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be realized however should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are in fixedrate shortterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to 

changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2008 we had 231 million invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2008 and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 

currency rate risk 

we operate in north america europe asiapacific costa rica and japan as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we sell our products in the local currency for the respective country this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions the impact of an aggregate decline of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material 

prior to january 1 2007 the functional currency of align and our subsidiaries was the us dollar and accordingly gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euros costa rican colones and other currencies were reflected in other income expense during the first quarter of 2007 we analyzed the various economic factors of our international subsidiaries in accordance with fas 52 and determined that there had been a significant change in facts and circumstances to warrant a change in the functional currency for some of our european subsidiaries from the us dollar to the local currency effective january 1 2007 the adjustment from translating certain european subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar was recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets

 item 1 business 

our company 

align technology inc was incorporated in april 1997 under the laws of the state of delaware we design manufacture and market the invisalign system a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with traditional metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition we received fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998 the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 

we distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist or gp orthodontists and gps must complete an invisalign training course in order to provide the invisalign solution to their patients the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asiapacific latin america and japan in parts of the asiapacific and latinamerican region we recently transitioned the sales of our product to a distributor model 

on the financial information page within the investor relations section of our corporate website which can be accessed at either wwwaligntechcom or wwwinvisaligncom  we make our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k our proxy statement on schedule 14a for our annual stockholders meeting and amendments to such reports available as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission or sec all such filings are available free of charge the information in or that can be accessed through our website is not part of this report 

industry background 

malocclusion 

malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting over 195 million individuals or approximately 65 of the us population approximately 23 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with traditional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek treatment 

traditional orthodontic treatment 

in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patients teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices 

the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patients condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patients teeth with cement and attach an arch wire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patients teeth to achieve desired tooth movement because of the length of time between visits the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patients teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us 3500 to 7000 with a median fee of approximately 5000 generally only a portion of the fee is reimbursed by insurance if covered at all in addition dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professionals estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professionals estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time and reduced profitability for the dental professional 

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment 

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages traditional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

• unattractive appearance braces call attention to the patients condition and treatment in addition braces trap food which can further compromise appearance braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth many adults associate braces with adolescence as a result of these and other limitations relatively few adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually • oral discomfort braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth the tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit 4 

• poor oral hygiene braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more difficult to brush and floss these problems can result in tooth decay and periodontal damage additionally the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth • inability to project treatment historically dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment accordingly dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment as a result they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits this lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professionals ability to estimate the duration of treatment because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental professional • physical demands on dental professional the manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional • root resorption the sustained high levels of force associated with traditional treatment can result in root resorption which is a shortening of tooth roots this shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient • emergencies at times braces need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability 

the align solution 

invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion the invisalign system is comprised of several phases the principal steps of which are the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck and the manufacturing of invisalign aligners 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches xrays of the patients dentition photographs of the patient a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patients upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form or prescription the impression is a critical component of the invisalign system as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patients teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models and subsequent molds and aligners an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patients teeth the prescription is also a critical component of the invisalign system describing the desired positions and movement of the patients teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our santa clara california facility 

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patients initial malocclusion upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patients dentition using computed tomography known as ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patients current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professionals prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in san jose costa rica 

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a proposed customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulated treatment plan called clincheck is an internally developed and proprietary computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients this clincheck simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon completion of the review the patients clincheck is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via virtual invisalign practice vip our proprietary customer interfacing software portal which is available on our websites located at wwwinvisaligncom and wwwaligntechcom  the dental professional then reviews the clincheck and can either accept the proposed treatment or request modifications and adjustments until satisfied with the treatment plan clincheck allows the dental professional to view this threedimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly clincheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to view the clincheck treatment plan allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professionals final approval of the proposed clincheck treatment engages us to manufacture the corresponding molds and aligners 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment upon the dental professionals approval of the clincheck simulation we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to construct a series of molds of the patients teeth each mold is a replica of the patients teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment international manufacturing solutions operaciones srl or ims a third party shelter services provider in juarez mexico manufactures the molds and then uses these molds to fabricate the patients aligners 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional from these molds ims fabricates aligners by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold aligners are custommanufactured thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck each aligner covers a patients teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment simulation after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series advancing the teeth movement with each aligner stage this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete for each of our current products aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with toothcolored attachments bonded to the patients teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement in certain cases we provide an alignerlike template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patients teeth also in cases where interproximal reduction or ipr is requested by the dental professional we provide an ipr treatment form quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction location and timing of ipr 

retention upon completion of the treatment the patient may be prescribed vivera retainers a clear aligner set designed for ongoing retention vivera is a subscriptionbased program that delivers new replacement retainers to patients every three months over the one year subscription period 

our products 

the vast majority of our revenues are generated from the sales of full invisalign and invisalign express treatments 

full invisalign treatment commercial sales of full invisalign treatment commenced in the us in july 1999 our traditional full invisalign treatment option is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and will consist of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors treatment goals for full invisalign aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment in fiscal 2007 approximately 88 of our net revenues were generated by the sale of full invisalign treatment 

invisalign express in the third quarter of 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex orthodontic cases invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten aligners invisalign express is intended to help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic treatment by providing a lowercost option for adult relapse cases for minor crowding and spacing or as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers for invisalign express aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment in fiscal 2007 approximately 8 of our net revenues were generated by the sale of invisalign express 

vivera in november 2007 we introduced vivera retainers a subscriptionbased program that delivers a new replacement retainer to orthodontic patients every three months for one year vivera retainers are produced using the same proprietary technology and material as the invisalign aligners and offer an effective aesthetic retention solution for both invisalign and noninvisalign patients vivera was fully launched to our north american sales force in the first quarter of 2008 

invisalign teen in january 2008 we announced the planned release of invisalign teen invisalign teen is designed to meet the specific needs of the nonadult comprehensive or teen treatment market planned features include an aligner wear indicator to help gauge patient compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address the natural eruption of key teeth and root control issues common in teen patients as part of invisalign teen we will include up to three free replacement aligners during active treatment to cover potential aligner loss for invisalign teen aligners other than the three replacement aligners will be manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment we anticipate that invisalign teen will be available in late 2008 

invisalign clinassist in january 2008 we announced the planned release of invisalign clinassist clinassist is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions similar to full invisalign clinassist however will also include a consultative approach to invisalign treatment for doctors who want a highly efficient treatment process with builtin monitoring tools and progress checks planned features include a simplified submission process case monitoring support by us to help doctors keep cases on track and staged shipment of aligners based on treatment progress for invisalign clinassist aligners will be shipped to the dental professionals in a series of staged deliveries as treatment progresses we anticipate that invisalign clinassist will be available in late 2008 or early 2009 

statements concerning our expectations regarding new products in development clinassist and invisalign teen and expectations related to their anticipated release are not guarantees of the date of availability which may be delayed or cancelled or of the availability of the features mentioned which may be changed or removed prior to release actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forwardlooking statement see item 1a risk factors for a more complete discussion of factors that might cause such differences 

proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form 10k such as clincheck and vip virtual invisalign practice are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue 

ancillary and other the remaining 4 of our net revenues are generated by training fees and sales of ancillary products such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 

benefits of invisalign 

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to traditional braces 

benefits to the dental professional 

• ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes clincheck enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely outcome of treatment in an interactive threedimensional computer model clincheck allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient • begin using invisalign with minimal additional training the biomechanical principles that underlie treatment with the invisalign system are consistent with those of traditional orthodontics dental professionals can complete our initial training in one day we provide additional clinical support following the initial training and encourage dental professionals to attend continuing education classes seminars and workshops • expanded patient base we believe that invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics currently approximately 23 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us as of december 31 2007 our share of the 23 million case starts is approximately 3 percent our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces adults who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment will be more likely to seek treatment we therefore believe that invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment in addition as the primary care provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base • decreased dental professional and staff time invisalign eliminates the need for timeintensive processes such as bonding appliances to the patients teeth adjusting arch wires during the course of treatment and removing the appliances at the conclusion of treatment as such use of invisalign reduces dental professional and staff chair time and can increase practice capacity • practice productivity we believe that as dental professionals move to a higher volume of invisalign patients they will be able to better leverage their existing resources including office space and staff time resulting in an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity benefits to the patient 

• excellent aesthetics aligners are nearly invisible when worn significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with traditional braces 8 

• comfort by replacing the sixweek adjustment cycle of traditional braces with twoweek stages aligners move teeth more gently also aligners are thin smooth and low in profile as a result aligners are more comfortable and less abrasive than traditional braces • improved oral hygiene patients can remove aligners for tasks that are difficult with traditional braces such as eating brushing and flossing we believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal damage during treatment which may result from traditional braces • potentially reduced overall treatment time aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth in addition the clincheck simulation from which aligners are produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements together these factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to traditional braces • potentially reduced root resorption we believe that controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption which is the breakdown or destruction of root structure • reduced incidence of emergencies typically a lost or broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in the treatment series minimizing inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of traditional braces 

limitations of invisalign 

in some instances the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to traditional treatment aligners cost more to produce than traditional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in traditional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional and the treatment selected the cost of invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for traditional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there is generally a turnaround time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with traditional braces for optimal results in addition because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech in some instances patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have occurred we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 

our target market and patient base 

approximately 23 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us of which approximately 40 of these patients or approximately 900 thousand have mature dentition with fullyerupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth with mild to moderate malocclusions historically invisalign has predominately been marketed to treat patients with fullyerupted mature dentition adults and older teens as of december 31 2007 our share of the 23 million case starts is approximately 3 and approximately 8 of the 900 thousand patients with mature dentition our served market our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces adults who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment will be more likely to seek treatment and therefore 

represent our most immediate market expansion opportunity however with the planned launch of invisalign teen in the latter half of 2008 we will for the first time offer a product designed to meet the needs of the nonadult comprehensive or teen treatment market specifically those individuals who have shed their baby teeth but do not yet have fullyerupted mature dentition even though we have not previously marketed our product to treat younger patients approximately 15 of our total case starts in 2007 were with individuals younger than 19 launching a teenspecific product will make the invisalign system more applicable to an orthodontists patient base which we believe will provide us the opportunity to increase our penetration into and our share of the nonadult comprehensive or teen treatment market 

published market data for gps providing treatment for malocclusion is limited however as the primary care provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base we believe gps represent a significant market expansion opportunity 

as of december 31 2007 approximately 732000 patients worldwide have started treatment using invisalign the invisalign system is sold in north america europe asiapacific latin america and japan in 2007 international sales accounted for 16 of our net revenues a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in note 15 segments and geographic information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

for 2007 2006 and 2005 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total net revenues 

business strategy 

our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion by focusing on the following key objectives driving product innovation increasing customer adoption and frequency of use what we call utilization by training dental professionals and focusing on education and customer support and stimulating consumer demand 

product innovation—new products and enhancements to existing products we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future longterm growth by driving and sustaining product adoption enhancing the user experience and thereby increasing utilization growth currently the invisalign system is a single system used by both gps and orthodontists we are committed to delivering new products and introducing new product features to better meet the needs of our two customers—orthodontists and gps—each with distinct and separate needs orthodontists want a more robust set of tools for greater predictability wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system on the other hand typical gps want greater ease of use more efficient and simplified diagnostic tools guidance through the case setup process minimal treatment intervention and selfhelp tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion based on this knowledge we announced the anticipated release of two products—invisalign teen in the latter half of 2008 and invisalign clinassist in the latter half of 2008 or early 2009 invisalign teen will include features such as an aligner wear indicator to help gauge patient compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address the natural eruption of key teeth and root control issues common in teen patients predominately marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients these features make it easier and more efficient for orthodontists to treat those younger patients invisalign clinassist is the first phase of our gpspecific product platform which is being designed as a turnkey consultative approach to invisalign treatment for doctors who want a highly efficient treatment process with builtin monitoring tools and progress tracking we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase demand for invisalign the planned roll out of invisalign clinassist and invisalign teen and other future products will rely on new features tools and delivery options to meet specific clinical demands while providing a family of endtoend 

solutions for our customers we believe enhanced product performance and innovation will continue to drive the adoption and frequency of use what we call utilization and increase customer productivity resulting in increased demand for invisalign and market share expansion 

increase customer adoption and utilization by first increasing adoption through the expansion of our customer base and then increasing utilization by offering new products and feature enhancements to meet the needs of orthodontists and gps we believe the overall market for invisalign and our share of that market will increase 

training new orthodontists and general practitioners expanding our customer base through training is a key part of our strategy through the end of 2007 we have trained 27480 gps and 8310 orthodontists in the united states and 12340 doctors internationally in addition by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option currently we have incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of 38 university programs we expect additional dental schools to integrate the invisalign technique into their curricula in the future 

focus on education and customer support in order to build longterm relationships with our customers and increase utilization we focus on providing ongoing training support and services in early 2008 we announced the introduction of the aligntech institute program brand which consolidates our extensive clinical education programs under a new interactive website that will provide clinical education and practice development training opportunities for our invisalign trained doctors on demand these practice development training opportunities will include instructorled training classes seminars and workshops conference calls webbased videos case studies and other clinical resources many of these courses and resources are eligible for continuing education ce credits by participating in these events we believe that our customers will emerge with a better understanding of the product and its applicability and with a greater aptitude for starting and finishing invisalign cases successfully the cornerstone of our clinical education program is wwwaligntechinstitutecom  which provides information and registration for our training workshops conference calls and seminars and provides an extensive range of case studies best practices testimonials and online coursework to ensure treatment success and improve practice economics our vip portal virtual invisalign practice provides our trained doctors and their staff access to thousands of invisalign cases and best practices as well as up to date support information programs and marketing materials for continuous support and information access 

stimulate demand for invisalign treatment—increasing our patient base marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving longterm growth our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to increase the number of patients who seek invisalign treatment annually in 2008 we expect to increase our overall marketing spending in the united states with a focus on programs such as advertising and digital online media designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors we also intend to initiate similar consumer marketing efforts but on a smaller scale in key european countries we believe that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase the overall market acceptance of our products 

manufacturing 

to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 

we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process in the event that either of these vendors become unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 

as of december 31 2007 our manufacturing and operations staff in the us and costa rica consisted of 641 people manufacturing is coordinated in santa clara california digital dental modeling is processed in our 63000 square foot facility in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatments using simulation software sla stereolithography molds and aligners are manufactured packaged and distributed at ims an outsourced third party shelter services provider based in juarez mexico information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading risk factors 

throughput management 

because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continue to upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez mexico in order to scale our manufacturing capacity we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment 

quality assurance 

aligns quality system is in compliance with food  drug administrations medical device regulations 21cfr part 820 and health canadas medical device regulations we are certified to en iso 134852003 internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing and of the council of canada we have a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since we custom manufacture aligners on a buildtoorder basis we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck and each aligner is unique we inspect the product at various points during the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers expectations aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed in the event aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patients dentition to us we use the impressions to create a new clincheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth 

sales and marketing 

we market invisalign by communicating invisaligns benefits to dental professionals through our training programs and mail campaigns and to consumers through a nationwide advertising campaign based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign in order to serve anticipated demand we continue to train a broad base of dental professionals 

professional marketing 

our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july 1999 in 2001 we began marketing invisalign to gps in our north american market as of december 31 2007 our north american sales organization consisted of 163 people of which 136 were direct sales representatives and 27 were sales administration and management internationally we have over 30 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2007 we continually evaluate cost effective ways to support our customers in smaller markets for instance during 2007 we transitioned the sales of our products in part of the asiapacific and latinamerican regions to a distributor model we will consider selling through a distributor in other smaller markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a casebycase basis 

we provide training marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps in the us and canada which we consider our north american market and internationally as of december 31 2007 we had trained 48130 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those trained dental professionals approximately 74 are dental professionals in our north american market within our north american market we have trained 8310 orthodontists and 27480 active gps cumulatively through the end of 2007 

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of our website 

after doctors complete their training sales representatives will follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases these practice development activities may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions establishing an internet connection and familiarizing them with our website sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

in 2008 we expect to increase marketing spending in the united states related to bringing new products to market such as vivera invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist including spending related to pilot testing and the actual launch of such products 

consumer marketing 

our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources 

• an orthodontist • a gp • consumer marketing and advertising • our website which can be accessed at either wwwinvisaligncom or wwwaligntechcom • directtoconsumer mail advertising and public relations efforts and • other invisalign patients in 2008 we expect to increase marketing spending in the united states with a focus on programs designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors we believe that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase demand for our product 

research and development 

our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines including the development of distinct product platforms for the gps and orthodontists such as invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist our research and development expenses were 257 million for 2007 185 million for 2006 and 186 million for 2005 

in an effort to demonstrate invisaligns broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process as mentioned in our business strategy we are making investments in the development of orthospecific and gpspecific platforms to meet the needs of our customers to increase adoption and utilization of invisalign we will continue to invest in ongoing product enhancements and software tools development 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2007 we had 98 issued us patents 167 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications see item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading risk factors 

seasonality 

seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected and are likely to continue to affect our business specifically our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases these seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 

backlog 

due to the nature of our business we maintain relatively low levels of backlog the period from which treatment data or a case is received until the acceptance of the computersimulated treatment plan or clincheck is dependent on the dental professionals discretion to modify accept or cancel the treatment plan therefore we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved clincheck our backlog consists of clincheckapproved cases which are generally shipped within a short period of time as a result we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future sales and our quarterly revenues depend largely on the timing of clincheck approvals and the impact on cases shipped in that quarter 

competition 

we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets which include 3m company sybron dental specialties and dentsply international inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign including the products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties in may 2006 danaher corporation purchased sybron dental specialties see item 3 legal proceedings for a summary of our litigation with ormco in the future we may face further competition from early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading risk factors 

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following 

• aesthetic appeal of the treatment method • effectiveness of treatment • customer support • comfort associated with the treatment method • oral hygiene • ease of use and • dental professionals chair time we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

fdas quality system regulation for medical devices the invisalign system is classified as a class ii medical device in 1998 we received premarket clearance from the fda pursuant to the 510k premarket notification procedure allowing us to market the product in the us we believe our 

invisalign system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the invisalign system 

our aligners are manufactured by ims a third party shelter services provider based in juarez mexico ims is registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturer and is certified to iso 90012000 requirements we have also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes have been implemented at ims to comply with the fdas quality systems standards ims has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel in the manufacture and distribution of invisalign we and ims are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer 

if the fda determines that we or ims failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 

health canadas medical device regulations in canada we are required to comply with health canadas medical device regulations our products are registered with health canada we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada 

european unions mdd requirements  iso 13485 in europe invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such we follow the requirements of the medical device directives we are iso 13485 certified which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe 

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information although compliance is principally the responsibility of the hospital physician or other healthcare provider we are required to maintain the confidentiality of patient information when providing technical services and when handling patient information and records we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements 

other federal and state laws as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and 

regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions under the federal antikickback statute prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers finally various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service for dentists and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 we had 1307 employees including 641 in manufacturing and operations 340 in sales and marketing 154 in research and development and 172 in general and administrative functions we had 576 employees in the us 586 employees in costa rica 134 employees in europe and 11 employees in japan

 item 1a risk factors 

we have only recently returned to profitability if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price for our common stock may decline 

while we returned to profitability in 2007 we experienced a net loss in each quarter of 2006 if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our revenues while controlling our expenses while we generated positive operating cash flow in 2007 we experienced negative cash flow in 2006 we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from operations from period to period in the future because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

• limited visibility into and difficulty predicting the level of activity in our customers practices from quarter to quarter • changes in the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter which given our cycle time and the delay between case receipts and case shipments could have an impact on which quarter revenue can be recognized • changes in product mix • seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments • success of marketing programs from quarter to quarter • changes in the timing of revenue recognition with the introduction of new products such as invisalign clinassist and invisalign teen • unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity • any disruptions in the manufacturing process including unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes or natural or other disasters beyond our control 19 

• the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors • aggressive price competition from competitors • costs and expenditures in connection with litigation • inaccurate forecasting of revenues production and other operating costs and • investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to invisalign to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations whether caused by changes in consumer spending consumer preferences weakness in the us or global economies changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product or other factors we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign or average selling prices would adversely affect revenues gross margin and net profits 

we expect that revenues from the sale of the invisalign system will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines as it has in the past our operating results would be harmed factors that could cause invisalign not to achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 

dental professionals may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

our success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the invisalign system by dental professionals what we refer to as utilization invisalign requires orthodontists gps and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways in addition because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july 1997 and commercially available only since july 1999 orthodontists and gps may be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available also increasing adoption and cumulative use by orthodontists and gps will depend on factors such as the capability safety efficacy ease of use price quality and reliability of our products our ability to provide effective sales support training and service and the availability of competing products technologies and alternative treatments in addition unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and consequently reduced acceptance by dental professionals also increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice if adoption and utilization does not increase as we anticipate our revenues may fail to grow as expected and our operating results may be harmed 

consumers may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment in addition consumers may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for invisalign which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment we have generally received positive feedback from both orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety ease of use reliability aesthetics greater comfort and hygiene compared to traditional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products furthermore consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience adoption by consumers may also be affected by general macroeconomic conditions in north america and internationally which fluctuate and could be affected by unstable global economic political or other conditions 

the frequency of use by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization or the adoption and frequency of use of the invisalign system by new and existing customers if utilization of invisalign by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products 

in response to challenges in our business including increased competition in november 2005 we reduced the list price of full invisalign cases and in the third quarter of 2005 we introduced invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex cases in addition in the fourth quarter of 2005 we expanded our volume based discount program to all doctors as a result of these programs the blended average selling price of our products declined in 2006 compared to 2005 additionally in europe we introduced new pricing initiatives in the first quarter of 2006 which resulted in a lower average selling price although our blended average selling prices increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of a product mix shift towards full invisalign and an increasing number of lower volume gps who did not attain volume discount levels if we are to introduce any similar discount programs in the future or if participation in these programs increases our revenues gross margin and net profits losses may be adversely affected 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop obtain regulatory approval or clearance of manufacture and market new products we announced the anticipated launch of invisalign teen in the latter half of 2008 and invisalign clinassist in the latter half of 2008 or early 2009 there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things our ability to include functionality and features that address customer requirements the availability of thirdparty reimbursement of procedures using our new products the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns in addition even if our new products are successfully introduced it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient since it takes approximately 12 to 24 months to treat a patient our 

customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 

our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 

we are dependent on our international operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds ims our third party shelter services provider located in juarez mexico fabricates the aligner molds the aligners and ships the completed products to our customers in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our santa clara california facility we also carry out research and development at locations in costa rica and moscow russia our increasing reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

• difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations • difficulties in managing international operations including our relationship with ims our third party shelter services provider • fluctuations in currency exchange rates • import and export license requirements and restrictions • controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process • political social and economic instability • acts of terrorism and acts of war • interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services • product or material transportation delays or disruption • burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws • trade restrictions and changes in tariffs and • potential adverse tax consequences if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

training technicians to use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the electronic treatment plan that forms the basis of clincheck takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely create clincheck treatment plans within the timeframe our customers expect any delay in clincheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished aligners to our customers such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers this could cause a decline in our revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters clincheck setup and other manufacturing processes are all principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated by ims our third party shelter services provider located in juarez mexico both costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners in addition our headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process and if our access to these inputs is diminished our business may be harmed 

we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process we rely on ims a third party shelter services provider located in juarez mexico to fabricate aligner molds as well as finished aligners and to ship the completed product to customers if ims fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by ims with respect to hiring and retaining qualified personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible 

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our invisalign product competes directly against products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties a danaher corporate subsidiary and traditional braces manufactured by 3m company and dentsply international these manufacturers have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically 

unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues volume growth net profit losses and stock price we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations revenues and operating results 

we are currently focused on adding additional functionality into our business enterprise systems and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future which will more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results furthermore we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically clincheck and vip software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2007 we had 98 issued us patents 167 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products during fiscal 2005 and 2006 requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto by a san francisco california law firm acting on behalf of an unnamed party and in some instances acting on behalf of orthoclear requesting reexamination of a number of our patents see item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of the uspto proceedings in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share 

in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation for example we are currently involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with ormco in addition during 2005 and 2006 we were involved in several lawsuits with orthoclear inc and other parties related to orthoclear including a patent infringement action against orthoclear filed in the western district of wisconsin madison we settled this lawsuit in october 2006 however the potential effects on our business operations resulting from similar litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in addition litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price see item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial 

reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third partys patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular we are committed to purchasing all of our resin from a singlesource and our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by single suppliers technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity 

or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we have experienced rapid growth and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business 

we have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in 1999 our headcount increased from approximately 50 employees as of december 31 1999 to 1307 employees as of december 31 2007 this expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the us and internationally in particular growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas including recruiting and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards and preserving our culture and values our inability to effectively manage growth could harm our business 

we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets as of december 31 2007 our north american sales organization consisted of 163 people of which 136 were direct sales representatives and 27 were sales administration and regional sales management internationally we have over 30 people engaged in sales and sales support as of december 31 2007 we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services of these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to reestablish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed in addition due to our large and fragmented customer base we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product as a result adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our revenues may be harmed 

complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

• product design development manufacture and testing • product labeling • product storage • premarket clearance or approval • advertising and promotion and • product sales and distribution 27 

our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

• warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties • repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products • operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production • refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products • withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and • criminal prosecution if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections our failure or the failure of ims to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and 

accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

• storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records • prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and • the marketing and advertising of our products complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

we currently sell our products in europe canada mexico brazil australia hong kong and japan and may expand into other countries from time to time we do not know whether orthodontists gps and consumers outside our north american market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate in addition sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the 

effect of increasing our expenses and diverting managements attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

historically the market price for our common stock has been volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

• quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity • changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results • speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations • strategic actions by our competitors such as product announcements or acquisitions • announcements of technological innovations or new products by us our customers or competitors and • general market conditions in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future we would incur substantial legal fees and our managements attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

• revenue recognition • accounting for sharebased payments and • accounting for income taxes 30 

if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 

the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade liquid shortterm fixedincome securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value and the decline in fair value is deemed to be otherthantemporary we will be required to write down the value of our investments which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition moreover the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector with the current unstable credit environment we might incur significant realized unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 

we have adopted a shareholders rights plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders to date our board of directors has designated 200000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights plan 

our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period and we could owe significant taxes even during periods when we experience low operating profit or operating losses 

we have negotiated tax incentives with the costa rica ministry of foreign trade an agency of the government of costa rica under the incentives all of the income we earn in costa rica during these eight to twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax the incentive tax rates will expire in various fiscal years beginning in fiscal 2010 the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply absent the incentives is 30 for fiscal year 2007 as a result of these incentives income taxes decreased by 2 million in fiscal year 2007 in order to receive the benefit of the incentives we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates which could cause our operating results to be harmed

ormco 

on january 6 2003 ormco corporation ormco filed suit against us in the united states district court for the central district orange county division asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 5683243 and 6244861 ormco is a division of sybron dental specialties in may 2006 danaher corporation acquired sybron dental specialties the complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief on february 18 2003 we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of the asserted patents in addition we counterclaimed for infringement of our us patent no 6398548 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on march 10 2003 and asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6398548 we amended our counterclaim to add allesee orthodontic appliances inc aoa a whollyowned subsidiary of ormco as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of us patent no 6398548 the court then permitted ormco to amend its complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional patent each ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of us patent no 6616444 on october 15 2003 on october 27 2003 we filed an answer to ormcos first amended complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6616444 and for infringement of us patent no 6554611 

in connection with these claims the court granted five motions for summary judgment that we filed first on may 14 2004 the court granted our motion for summary judgment of noninfringement finding that our invisalign system does not infringe any of the asserted ormco patents 5447432 5683243 6244861 and 6616444 second on july 2 2004 the court granted in part our motion for summary judgment of infringement finding that ormco and aoa infringe certain but not all claims of our patents nos 6398548 and 6554611 through the manufacture and sale of red white  blue appliances third on august 26 2004 the court granted our motion for summary judgment of invalidity of ormcos asserted patents claims 5447432 5683243 6244861 and 6616444 as noted above the court earlier found that we do not infringe these patents in addition the court also denied ormcos and aoas motion for summary judgment seeking a finding of invalidity of our asserted patent claims 6398548 and 6554611 fourth the court granted our summary judgment motion that our asserted patent claims are not invalid based on the evidence currently before the court although the court granted that motion it reopened discovery on two additional invalidity arguments ormco and aoa asserted fifth the court also granted our summary judgment motion that our patents are not unenforceable and granted ormcos and aoas summary judgment motion that ormco and aoa did not willfully infringe our patents 

on december 20 2004 we filed a further summary judgment motion that our asserted claims are not invalid based on ormcos and aoas new evidence ormco and aoa filed a countersummary judgment motion that our asserted claims are invalid based on this new evidence the motions were heard by the court on february 7 2005 on february 24 2005 the court granted our motion in part confirming the validity of all of the asserted claims of our 6554611 patent and two of the asserted claims of our 6398548 patent the court also granted ormcos and aoas motion in part finding certain claims of our 6398548 patent to be invalid in view of prior use evidence on march 10 2005 ormco and aoa moved for reconsideration of the courts ruling that claims 10 and 17 of our us patent no 6398548 are not invalid on april 8 2005 the court ruled that it would adhere to its previous ruling that claims 10 and 17 of our 6398548 patent are not invalid 

on march 28 2005 we filed a motion for permanent injunction to prevent ormco and aoa from selling the infringing red white  blue system on may 26 2005 the court issued a permanent injunction the permanent injunction to enjoin ormco and aoa from further infringement of claims 10 and 17 of our 6398548 patent and claims 13 and 7 of our 6554611 patent on may 31 2005 ormco and aoa filed a notice of appeal with the federal circuit from the permanent injunction 

there have been two appeals after the permanent injunction was entered ormco and aoa appealed that injunction and the orders of the district court on summary judgment on which the injunction was based oral argument took place on april 3 2006 following oral argument the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc issued a ruling declaring two out of a total of seventyone claims in our us patent no 6398548 and four out of a total of ten claims in us patent no 6554611 to be invalid as obvious the cafcs decision reverses the california district court summary judgment order of validity 

the 6398548 patent consists of seventyone claims only claims 10 and 17 were at issue in the first appeal and cafc ruling these two claims are directed to a system of appliances and method of repositioning teeth from an initial to a final tooth arrangement where at least some of the appliances are marked to show order of use these claims contain further limitations requiring instructions as to the order in which the appliances are to be worn and use of the appliances in intervals of 220 days 

the 6554611 patent consists of ten claims directed to a system for repositioning teeth that includes one or more intermediate appliances and a final appliance provided in a single package as well as instructions which set forth the order in which the appliances are to be worn the cafcs ruling pertains only to claims 1 2 3 and 7 in the patent 

the second appeal was from the final judgment ormco appealed the ruling of the district court that 92 claims in four of its patents are not infringed by us and that the asserted claims are invalid we appealed the ruling of the district court that certain claims of our 6398548 patent which were found to be infringed by ormcos and aoas red white  blue appliances were invalid the cafc issued a ruling on august 24 2007 affirming the district courts ruling that 86 out of 92 claims in ormcos 5447432 5683243 6244861 and 6616444 patents are invalid and not infringed by us the cafc reversed the district courts noninfringement and invalidity rulings on six claims in ormcos 6616444 patent which will be returned to the district court for a determination of validity and infringement of those claims the court has denied ormcos petition for rehearing with respect to the portion of the federal circuits opinion that affirmed the district courts ruling of noninfringement and nonenablement of the 86 claims 

on our crossappeal the cafc affirmed the district courts finding that six claims in our 6398548 patent claims 13 and 1113 are invalid these six claims are directed to a system of appliances and method of repositioning teeth from an initial to a final tooth arrangement where at least some of the appliances are marked to show the order of use the majority of the claims in the 6398548 patent including claims that address methods of fabricating aligners digital data sets or 

computergenerated models to fabricate appliances are unaffected by the second appeal and the cafcs ruling 

we previously entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement with ormco and aoa pursuant to which ormco and aoa were required to pay into escrow pending the completion of the appeals process as discussed above 884000 to resolve the issues of past damages willfulness and attorneys fees for the adjudged infringement of two of our patents the align patents through the manufacture and sale of ormcos and aoas red white  blue appliances our receipt of the payments out of escrow was contingent upon the court in a final nonappealable judgment finding that ormco or aoa infringes at least one of the claims in the align patents as discussed above the cafc has now issued a final nonappealable judgment of invalidity with respect to each asserted claim of the align patents and therefore all funds in the escrow account will be returned to ormco and aoa 

ormco has filed a petition with the us supreme court asking for an extension of time in which to file a petition for review by the us supreme court with respect to the portion of the cafcs opinion that affirmed the district courts ruling of noninfringement and nonenablement of the 86 claims the supreme court granted ormcos petition for an extension of time on february 14 2008 ormco filed with the us supreme court a petition for review of the federal circuits ruling that 86 of ormcos patent claims are not infringed and are invalid we will have an opportunity to respond to ormcos petition

 class action 

on may 18 2007 debra a weber filed a consumer class action lawsuit against us orthoclear inc and orthoclear holdings inc dba orthoclear inc in syracuse new york us district court the complaint alleges two causes of action against the orthoclear defendants and one cause of action against us for breach of contract the cause of action against us titled breach of third party benefit contract references our agreement to make invisalign treatment available to orthoclear patients alleging that we failed to provide the promised treatment to plaintiff or any of the class members 

on july 3 2007 we filed our answer to the complaint and asserted 17 affirmative defenses on july 20 2007 we filed a motion for summary judgment on the third cause of action the only cause of action alleged against us on august 24 2007 weber filed a motion for class certification on october 1 2007 we filed an opposition to the motion of class certification and we are currently awaiting rulings from the court orthoclear has filed a motion to dismiss the initial case management conference and all discovery has been stayed pending the courts decision on the motion for class certification orthoclears motion to dismiss and our motion for summary judgment 

litigating claims of the types discussed in this annual report on form 10k whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

price range of common stock 

our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol algn public trading of our common stock commenced on january 26 2001 prior to that date there was no public market for our common stock the following table shows for the periods indicated the high and low per share closing prices of our common stock as reported by the nasdaq global market 



on february 20 2008 the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market was 1300 per share as of february 20 2008 there were approximately 202 holders of record of our common stock because the majority of our shares of outstanding common stock is held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future our credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants including restrictions on our ability to pay dividends see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources 

performance graph 

  notwithstanding any statement to the contrary in any of our previous or future filings with the sec the following information relating to the price performance of our common stock shall not be deemed filed with the sec or soliciting material under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or subject to regulation 14a or 14c or to liabilities of section 18 of the exchange act except to the extent we specifically request that such information be treated as soliciting material or to the extent we specifically incorporate this information by reference 

the following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with that of the nasdaq stock market us index a broad market index published by the national association of securities dealers inc a peer group that we used from january 2005 until july 2007 and a new peer group that we believe in good faith is a more appropriate basis for comparison since it better reflects the labor market in which we compete the comparison for each of the periods assumes that 100 was invested on january 1 2003 in our common stock the stocks in the nasdaq stock market us index and the stocks in the peer group index and that all dividends were reinvested 

comparison of 5 year cumulative total return among align technology inc the nasdaq composite index a new peer group and an old peer group 

in 2007 we completed a review of our peer group and determined that 4 of the original peer group companies had been acquired or were otherwise no longer publicly traded and the former peer group in general no longer was the best reflection of the companies for which we compete for executive talent as a result we formed a new peer group for 2007 and 2008 this peer group consists of 13 companies that are predominantly although not exclusively located in the san francisco bay area the geographic location in which we operate and compete for executive talent in addition to geographic location these companies were chosen using the following principles 

• companies that are close industry competitors generally of comparable size • medical device companies that are similar in size as measured by revenue and growth rates and • technology companies with similar growth potential and technology development needs for software and enterprise system designers 39 

the former peer group consisted of 15 companies listed below 

   we believe that the companies included in the new peer group provide a more accurate representative sample of enterprises that compete in sectors related to the market in which we compete for executive talent 




 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

align technology inc founded in april 1997 designs manufactures and markets invisalign a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces we received the united states food and drug administration fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998 and we began commercial operations and sales of full invisalign treatment in july 1999 

each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient our full invisalign treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors treatment goals our invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten aligners invisalign express treatment is intended to assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lower cost option for adult relapse cases minor crowding and spacing or as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatment such as veneers 

a number of factors the most important of which are set forth below may affect our results during 2008 and beyond 

• product innovation—new products and enhancements to existing products we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future longterm growth by driving and sustaining product adoption and enhancing the user experience and thereby increasing utilization growth currently the invisalign system is a single system used by both gps and orthodontists we are committed to delivering new products and introducing new product features to better meet the needs of our two customers—orthodontists and gps—each with distinct and separate needs orthodontists want a more robust set of tools for greater predictability wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system on the other hand typical gps want greater ease of use more efficient and simplified diagnostic tools guidance through the case setup process minimal treatment intervention and selfhelp tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion based on this knowledge we announced the anticipated release of two products—invisalign teen in the latter half of 2008 and invisalign clinassist in the latter half of 2008 or early 2009 invisalign teen will include features such as an aligner wear indicator to help gauge patient compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address the natural eruption of key teeth and root control issues common in teen patients predominately marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients these features make it easier and more efficient for orthodontists to treat those younger patients invisalign clinassist is the first phase of our gpspecific product platform and is being designed as a turnkey consultative approach to invisalign treatment for doctors who want a highly efficient treatment process with builtin monitoring tools and progress tracking we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase demand for invisalign the planned roll out of invisalign clinassist and invisalign teen and other future products will rely on new features tools and delivery options to meet specific clinical demands while providing a family of endtoend solutions for our 42 

customers we believe enhanced product performance and innovation will continue to drive the adoption and frequency of use what we call utilization and increase customer productivity resulting in increased demand for invisalign and market share expansion 

however with the anticipated introduction of invisalign teen our invisalign product family will for the first time include a product designed to meet the specific needs of the nonadult comprehensive or teen treatment market specifically those individuals who have shed their baby teeth but do not yet have fullyerupted mature dentition teen patients make up the majority of most orthodontists case starts as a result launching a teenspecific product will make the invisalign system more applicable to an orthodontists patient base which we believe we are better positioned to increase our penetration into and our share of the nonadult comprehensive or teen treatment market 

• increase customer adoption and utilization by first increasing adoption through the expansion of our customer base and then increasing utilization by offering new products and feature enhancements to meet the needs of orthodontists and gps we believe the overall market for invisalign and our share of that market will increase although we expect that over the longterm our utilization rates will gradually improve we expect that period over period comparisons of our utilization rates will fluctuate our quarterly utilization rates for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 are as follows utilization rates 

 utilization rates   of cases shipped   of doctors cases were shipped to • training new orthodontists and general practitioners expanding our customer base through training is a key part of our strategy through december 31 2007 we have trained 27480 gps and 8310 orthodontists in the united states and 12340 doctors internationally in addition by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option in 2007 we trained approximately 7400 gps and orthodontists worldwide and expect to train a comparable amount in 2008 currently we have incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of 38 university programs we expect additional dental schools to integrate the invisalign technique into their curricula in the future 43 

• focus on education and customer support in order to build longterm relationships with our customers and increase utilization we focus on providing ongoing training support and services in early 2008 we announced the introduction of the aligntech institute program brand which consolidates our extensive clinical education programs under a new interactive website that will provide clinical education and practice development training opportunities for our invisalign trained doctors these practice development training opportunities will include instructorled certification classes seminars and workshops conference calls webbased videos case studies and other clinical resources many of these courses and resources are eligible for continuing education ce credits by participating in these events we believe that our customers will emerge with a better understanding of the product and its applicability and with a greater aptitude for starting and finishing invisalign cases successfully the cornerstone of our clinical education program is wwwaligntechinstitutecom  which provides information and registration for our training workshops conference calls and seminars and provides an extensive range of case studies best practices testimonials and online coursework to ensure treatment success and improve practice economics our vip portal virtual invisalign practice provides our trained doctors and their staff access to thousands of invisalign cases and best practices as well as up to date support information programs and marketing materials for continuous support and information access • stimulate demand for invisalign treatment—increasing our patient base marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving longterm growth our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to increase the number of patients who seek invisalign treatment annually in 2008 we expect to increase our overall marketing spending in the united states with a focus on programs such as advertising and digital online media designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors we also intend to initiate similar consumer marketing efforts but on a smaller scale in key european countries similar to 2007 we will continue to conduct advertising and consumer marketing activities involving television radio print media and our consumer website in 2008 we anticipate that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase the demand for our product • product mix during 2007 we experienced a decline in the number of invisalign express cases compared to the same period of 2006 we believe that this shift in product mix began in the fourth quarter of 2006 after we removed the cancellation fees on full invisalign cases prior to clincheck approval and clarified clinical protocols surrounding what is an appropriate invisalign express case for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 our invisalign revenues as a percentage of total net revenues are as follows 

1 invisalign express was launched in the third quarter of 2005 44 

we recently launched vivera retainers and have announced the planned launch of invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist as a result of and depending upon the timing of these new product launches as well as the timing of customer adoption we expect our mix of products to begin shifting gradually in the latter part of 2008 and into 2009 key features of these new products include staged delivery of aligners with invisalign clinassist and three free replacement aligners will be included in invisalign teen as a result of these features these new products will have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling price compared to our current products included in the price of full invisalign treatment we offer case refinement which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patients teeth to the desired final position each of invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist include the deferral for case refinement in addition however revenue for the three replacement aligners included in invisalign teen will be deferred based on their fair market value until the earlier of replacement aligners being used or until the case is completed invisalign clinassist will be invoiced upon the first staged shipment and revenue will be deferred to the balance sheet and recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment the vivera retainer subscription includes four shipments per year our customers will be invoiced upon the first shipment and revenue will be recognized ratably over the one year subscription period as these new products increase as a percentage of our revenues in the latter part of 2008 deferred revenue on our balance sheet will increase 

• growth of international markets we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in our key international markets europe and japan we will consider expanding to additional countries on a casebycase basis we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future • reliance on international manufacturing operations our manufacturing efficiency has been and will continue to be an important factor in our future profitability currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica dental technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans these electronic treatment plans form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds in addition we use international manufacturing solutions operaciones srl ims a third party based in juarez mexico for the fabrication and packaging of aligners our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of management to effectively manage these international operations including our relationship with ims in addition we currently are and will continue to be dependent on imss and our ability to hire and retain employees generally as well as hire and retain employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations if our management or ims fail in any of these respects we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue in addition even if we have case submissions we may not have a sufficient number of trained dental technicians in costa rica to create the clincheck treatment forms or if ims is unable to ship our product to our customers on a timely basis our revenue will be delayed or lost which will cause our operating results to fluctuate see item 1a—risk factors for risks related to our international operations • stockbased compensation effective january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment fas 123r using the modified prospective transition method which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards based on estimated fair values over the requisite service period in accordance with the modified prospective transition method our financial statements for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not include 45 

the impact of fas 123r for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 stockbased compensation expense recognized in accordance with fas 123r is as follows in thousands

 1 invisalign express was launched in the third quarter of 2005 revenues from both our north american orthodontic and gp channels increased in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of an overall increase in case volume and a favorable product mix shift towards full invisalign this product mix shift towards full invisalign began in the fourth quarter of 2006 after we removed the cancellation fees on full invisalign cases prior to clincheck approval and clarified clinical protocols surrounding what is an appropriate invisalign express case the increase in full invisalign revenues is partially offset by a lower average selling price which is due to the increased participation in our volumebased discount programs 

revenues from our north american orthodontic channel decreased 168 million or 196 in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of a decline in full invisalign revenues of 243 million partially offset by a 75 million increase in invisalign express revenues the decline in full invisalign revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices and case volumes in 2006 the reduced average selling price of the full invisalign product reflects the full year impact of pricing initiatives introduced in the second half of 2005 including the reduction in the list price of our full invisalign product and the expansion of our volume based discount program additionally the increase in invisalign express revenue resulted from higher case volumes in 2006 compared to 2005 since this product was launched in the third quarter of 2005 

revenues from our north american gp channel increased 48 million or 53 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in invisalign express revenues of 124 million partially offset by a 76 million decline in full invisalign revenues the increase in invisalign express revenues resulted from higher case volumes in 2006 compared to 2005 since this product was launched in the third quarter of 2005 the reduction in full invisalign revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices which reflect the full year impact of the pricing initiatives mentioned above 

the increase in our international invisalign revenues in 2007 compared to 2006 was attributable to an increase in case volume additionally our international revenues benefited from favorable exchange rates against the us dollar in 2007 these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price due to the increased participation in volumebased discount programs international revenues increased 89 million or 383 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a significant increase in our international invisalign case volumes partially offset by a lower average selling price as a result of pricing initiatives introduced in the first quarter of 2006 

other revenues consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products were higher in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of an increased number of doctors trained year over year other revenues increased during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily from an increase in the list price for training 

for 2008 we expect our total net revenues to increase compared to 2007 primarily due to case volume increases in our north american orthodontic and gp channels as well as in our international markets we expect our average selling price in 2008 to be comparable to 2007 we recently launched vivera retainers and have announced the planned launch of invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist as a result of and depending upon the timing of these new product launches as well as the timing of customer adoption we expect our mix of products to begin shifting gradually in the latter part of 2008 and into 2009 key features of these new products include staged delivery of aligners with invisalign clinassist and three free replacement aligners with invisalign teen as a result of these features these new products will have a significantly higher amount of deferred revenue as a percentage of their average selling price compared to our current products 

cost of revenues and gross margin 

 cost of revenues includes salaries for staff involved in the production process costs incurred by ims a third party shelter service provider in juarez mexico the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process training costs and stockbased compensation expense 

gross margin improved in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of increased case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure our case volume increased 352 in 2007 compared to 2006 resulting in decreases in our per unit standard cost additionally cost reductions resulting from improved operating efficiencies also contributed to the increase in 2007 gross margin 

gross margin decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to lower average selling prices attributable to the reduction in the list price of full invisalign and increased sales of our lower priced invisalign express product this decrease was partially offset by the reductions in product costs driven by increased volumes and manufacturing efficiencies including the relocation of the sla mold operations to juarez mexico 

we anticipate our gross margin in 2008 to be comparable to 2007 

sales and marketing 

 sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation including travelrelated costs marketing personnelrelated costs media and advertising clinical education product marketing and stockbased compensation expense 

our sales and marketing expense increased during 2007 compared to 2006 predominately as a result of a 103 million increase in media advertising and product marketing expenses and a 51 million increase in personnelrelated expenses the increase in personnelrelated expenses primarily resulted from a 37 million increase in salaries benefits and overhead attributable to additional headcount and a 14 million increase in stockbased compensation 

sales and marketing expense increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 28 million increase in payroll expense mainly attributable to an increase in headcount including the replacement of orthodontic sales representatives who left align in the first half of 2005 and a 29 million increase in stockbased compensation expense these increases were partially offset by a 39 million decrease in media advertising and other marketing expenses due to the initial launch of our consumer marketing campaign in the second quarter of 2005 

for 2008 we expect sales and marketing expense including stockbased compensation to be higher than in 2007 as we expanded our north american sales force in late 2007 and anticipate expanding our international sales force in 2008 in addition we expect to increase marketing spending in the united states and europe with a focus on consumer advertising including television digital online and print media and we will incur additional costs in the united states related to bringing new products to market such as vivera invisalign teen and invisalign clinassist 

general and administrative 

 general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel outside consulting services legal expenses and stockbased compensation expense 

general and administrative expense decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 largely due to a 206 million decline in external legal fees following the settlement of the orthoclear litigation in the fourth quarter of 2006 our 2007 legal expense includes a 16 million credit for an insurance reimbursement of legal costs also associated with the orthoclear litigation this decrease was partially offset by a 35 million increase in additional headcount and incentive compensation a 17 million increase in consulting fees and a 14 increase in stockbased compensation expense additionally amortization expense increased 22 million in 2007 compared to 2006 related to the amortization of the noncompete agreements we received in connection with the orthoclear settlement 

general and administrative expense increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 150 million increase in external legal fees primarily related to the orthoclear litigation a 38 million increase in payroll related expenses primarily resulting from the hiring of additional legal and administrative staff and a 40 million increase in stockbased compensation expense 

for 2008 we expect general and administrative expense including stockbased compensation to be higher than 2007 as we continue to build our information technology infrastructure and focus on training and organizational development 

research and development 

 research and development expense includes the personnelrelated costs and outside consulting expenses associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products conducting clinical and postmarketing trials and stockbased compensation expense 

research and development expense increased in 2007 compared to 2006 predominantly from a 50 million increase resulting from higher headcount and incentive compensation additionally a 15 million increase in outside services also contributed to the increase in 2007 research and development costs 

research and development expense decreased slightly in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 14 million decrease in temporary services and outside consulting expenses partially offset by a 13 million increase in stockbased compensation expense 

for 2008 we expect research and development spending to increase from 2007 as we continue to invest in bringing new products to market conducting clinical research and focusing on product development and enhancements 

patients first program and settlement costs 

 as part of the orthoclear agreement in october 2006 orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide as a result most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the patients first program we received no revenue for the program and incurred significant expense to complete these cases in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recorded an 83 million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program in accordance with fasb statement no 5 accounting for contingencies fas 5 this estimated amount was based on the number of orthoclear cases registered under the patients first program as of december 31 2006 in accordance with the patients first program terms and conditions those registered cases were required to be received by march 30 2007 in the first quarter of 2007 we reduced our patients first program accrual by 18 million to reflect a reduction of our initial estimate to the number of cases actually received by the case submission deadline we shipped virtually all patients first program cases during the first half of 2007 

we paid 200 million to orthoclear during the fourth quarter of 2006 in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement of which 140 million was capitalized on our balance sheet representing the fair value of the noncompete agreements and is being amortized over 5 years in 

accordance with emerging issues task force 0401 accounting for preexisting contractual relationships between the parties to a purchase business combination eitf 0401 we recorded the remaining 60 million as settlement costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

interest and other income expense net 

 interest and other income expense net includes interest income earned on cash balances interest expense on debt foreign currency translation gains and losses and other miscellaneous charges 

interest income for the year ended december 31 2007 increased compared to 2006 primarily due to higher average cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances in 2007 the increase in 2006 interest income compared to 2005 was attributable to higher effective interest rates 

other income expense net decreased in 2007 compared to 2006 reflecting the decrease in foreign currency translation gains in january 2007 we began to record the adjustments from translating certain european subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar as a separate component of shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the heading currency rate risk for additional information on the change in functional currency 

other income expense net increased 20 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 21 million increase in foreign currency translation gains resulting primarily from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 

income tax provision 

 we recorded an income tax provision of 12 million for 2007 08 million for 2006 and 13 million for 2005 representing effective tax rates of 33 24 and 482 respectively as of december 31 2007 we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing deferred tax assets due to uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize these assets before they expire as a result our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction we exercise significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth forecasted earnings and projected taxable income in determining the provision for income taxes and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from deferred tax assets we have historically experienced operating losses and have significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance future taxable income is based upon our estimates and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates if in the future we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance 

increasing income in the period such determination was made subsequently we would record a tax provision that approximates the blended statutory tax rate 

at december 31 2007 we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 2183 million for federal tax purposes and 683 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized these carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020 for federal purposes and 2010 for california purposes fas 123r prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled 76 million as of december 31 2007 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporations tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes if an ownership change is determined to have occurred our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation however based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december 31 2007 and our current estimate of the annual limitation we do not expect our net operating loss carryforwards to be limited at december 31 2007 we had research credit carryforwards of approximately 42 million for federal purposes and 53 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 

we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december 31 2007 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from product sales the proceeds of the sale of our common stock and from occasional borrowings under our available credit facility as of december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we had the following cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and shortterm investments 



net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended 2007 was 528 million resulting primarily from our net income of 357 million and noncash items such as depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and amortization of intangibles totaling 256 million additionally a 27 million increase in accounts payable also contributed to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities these increases in cash flows from operating activities were partially offset by a 107 million increase in accounts receivable 

net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 140 million resulting primarily from our net loss of 350 million and noncash items such as depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and amortization of intangibles totaling 192 million additionally a 64 million increase in current assets and a 58 million reduction in deferred revenue partially offset by a 143 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the cash used in operating activities the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to the 68 million accrual as of december 31 2006 for the anticipated costs of completing the patients first program 

net cash used in investing activities was 368 million for the year ended december 31 2007 which largely consisted of 299 million of net purchases of shortterm marketable securities and 74 million used for the purchase of capital assets 

net cash used in investing activities was 328 million for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to a 140 million purchase of intangible assets resulting from the orthoclear agreement 100 million for the purchase of capital assets and 89 million for net purchases of shortterm marketable securities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 175 million for the year ended december 31 2007 which consisted of 290 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options this increase was partially offset by the repayment of 115 million against the outstanding balance on our line of credit net cash provided by financing activities was 277 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and consisted of 162 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options and 115 million in net borrowings from our line of credit 

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting restricted stock units rsus which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercise as a result we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods in addition because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf during 2007 we paid 04 million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers 

on march 7 2007 we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank the amendment among other things reduced financial covenants to require only a quick ratio covenant effective january 1 2008 the amendment automatically increased the available borrowings under the existing revolving line of credit from 20 million to 25 million the amended credit facility matures on december 31 2008 at which point all outstanding borrowings on this credit facility must be repaid during 2007 we repaid 115 million of our outstanding borrowings under this credit facility as of december 31 2007 we have no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and we are in compliance with the financial covenant of this credit facility 

contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands 

 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a 4 as of december 31 2007 

we expect that our expense levels for 2008 will be higher compared to 2007 due to increases in our level of business activity we expect to increase sales and marketing spending as we expand our sales force and focus on consumer advertising and the launch of new products in addition we expect to incur additional research and development costs as we continue to invest in product development 

and enhancements we also expect increases in our general and administrative expenses as we continue to enhance our information technology infrastructure and business applications in addition we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market sell and support our products on a worldwide basis 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we enter into arrangements to sell products and services that contain multiple elements or multiple deliverables of products in the future revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured revenues are recognized from product sales net of discounts and rebates service revenues are recorded when performance is completed for revenue arrangements with multiple elements we use verifiable objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the undelivered elements and recognize the residual revenue for the delivered items upon shipment revenues for the undelivered elements are deferred based on a historical utilization rate or breakage factor and are recognized when delivery occurs actual utilization rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue in addition changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition but would not change the total revenue recognized 

stockbased compensation expense 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards fas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment fas 123r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated prior periods results under this method we recognize stockbased compensation expense for all sharebased 

payment awards granted after january 1 2006 and granted prior to but not yet vested as of december 31 2005 in accordance with fas 123r under the fair value recognition provisions of fas 123r we recognize stockbased compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award prior to fas 123r adoption we accounted for sharebased payment awards under accounting principles board opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 25 and accordingly recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with a discounted exercise price in conjunction with the adoption of fas 123r we changed our method of attributing the value of stockbased compensation expense from the accelerated multipleoption approach to the straightline single option method 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model consistent with the provisions of fas 123r and the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 sab 107 optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the options expected term and stock price volatility in addition judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards represent managements best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of managements judgment as a result if factors change and we use different assumptions our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future  see note 9 stockholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

on october 6 2005 the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting for all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than 710 options held by nonemployee directors were excluded from the vesting acceleration the fair market value of our common stock on the date of acceleration was 641 as quoted on the nasdaq global market as a result of the acceleration approximately 38 million options or 35 of the then total outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of october 6 2005 the purpose of the acceleration was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of fas 123r 

longlived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets 

intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets fas 144 we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses no intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented 

deferred tax valuation allowance 

we have established a full valuation allowance because we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is not likely deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in 

deferred tax assets and liabilities we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance 

we exercise significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth forecasted earnings and projected taxable income in determining the provision for income taxes and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from deferred tax assets we have historically experienced operating losses and have significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance future taxable income is based upon our estimates and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates if in the future we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net amount recorded we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance increasing income in the period such determination was made

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities our cash equivalents and investments are in fixedrate shortterm securities fixedrate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates and as a result our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2007 we had 388 million invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate 10 increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december 31 2007 and therefore we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 

currency rate risk 

we operate in north america europe asiapacific costa rica and japan as a result of our international business activities our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future we sell our products in the local currency for the respective country this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below regardless of this natural hedging our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and where appropriate may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions the impact of an aggregate decline of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material 

prior to january 1 2007 the functional currency of align and our subsidiaries was the us dollar and accordingly gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euros costa rican colones and other currencies were reflected in other income expense during the first quarter of 2007 we analyzed the various economic factors of our international subsidiaries in accordance with fas 52 and determined that there had been a significant change in facts and circumstances to warrant a change in the functional currency for some of our european subsidiaries from the us dollar to the local currency effective january 1 2007 the adjustment from translating certain european subsidiaries financial statements from the local currency into the us dollar was recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets

industry background 

malocclusion 

malocclusion the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting over 200 million individuals or approximately 75 of the us population approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us while most individuals seek 

orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional treatment 

traditional orthodontic treatment 

in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patient’s teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices 

the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient’s teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement because of the length of time between visits the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient’s teeth upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use a retainer 

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us 3500 to 7000 with a median fee of approximately 4800 generally only a portion of the fees is reimbursed by insurance if covered at all in addition dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional’s estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time and reduced profitability for the dental professional 

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment 

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

·   unattractive appearance  braces call attention to the patient’s condition and treatment in addition braces trap food which can further compromise appearance braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth many adults associate braces with adolescence as a result of these and other limitations less than one percent of american adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually

·   oral discomfort  braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth the tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit

·   poor oral hygiene  braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more difficult to brush and floss these problems can result in tooth decay and periodontal damage additionally the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth

·   inability to project treatment  historically dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment accordingly dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment as a result they cannot be precise about the 

direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits this lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professional’s ability to estimate the duration of treatment because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental professional 

·   physical demands on dental professional  the manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional

·   root resorption  the sustained high levels of force associated with conventional treatment can result in root resorption which is a shortening of tooth roots this shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient

·   emergencies  at times braces need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional

due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability 

the align solution 

invisalign which includes full invisalign treatment and invisalign express discussed below under “our products” is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion the invisalign treatment process is comprised of several phases the principal steps of which are the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck and the manufacturing of invisalign aligners referred to in this form 10k as “aligners” the complete invisalign treatment process is described in greater detail under “business—the invisalign treatment process”

clincheck   clincheck is an internally developed computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients we use a dental impression and a treatment form submitted by a dental professional to develop a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments clincheck allows the dental professional to view this threedimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly clincheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible

upon review of the clincheck simulation the dental professional may immediately approve the projected treatment or may provide us with feedback for modification we reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck simulation we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to manufacture aligner molds international manufacturing solutions operaciones srl or ims a third party shelter services provider in juarez mexico manufactures the molds and then uses these molds to fabricate the patient’s aligners 

aligners   aligners are custommanufactured thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck each aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment simulation after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series this process is repeated until the final 

aligners are used and treatment is complete upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use an invisalign retainer or go directly to a conventional retainer 

our products 

the vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of full invisalign treatment and invisalign express treatment 

full invisalign treatment   commercial sales of full invisalign treatment commenced in the us in july 1999 our traditional full invisalign treatment option is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and will consist of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctor’s treatment goals in fiscal 2006 approximately 81 of our net revenue was generated by the sale of full invisalign treatment

invisalign express   in the third quarter of 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex orthodontic cases invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten aligners invisalign express is intended to help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic treatment by providing a lowercost option for adult relapse cases for minor crowding and spacing and as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers in fiscal 2006 approximately 13 of our net revenue was generated by the sale of invisalign express

ancillary and other   the remaining 6 of our net revenue is generated by training fees and sales of ancillary products

benefits of invisalign 

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces 

benefits to the dental professional 

·   ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes  clincheck enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely outcome of treatment in an interactive threedimensional computer model clincheck allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient

·   begin using invisalign with minimal additional training  the biomechanical principles that underlie treatment with the invisalign system are consistent with those of traditional orthodontics dental professionals can complete our initial training within two days we provide additional clinical support following the initial training and encourage dental professionals to attend continuing education classes seminars and workshops

·   expanded patient base  we believe that invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics currently approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us these patients represent approximately 1 percent of the population of people with malocclusion of these we estimate approximately 45 percent or approximately 900000 patients have mature dentition with mild to moderate malocclusion and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign we believe that invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment

·   decreased dental professional and staff time  invisalign eliminates the need for timeintensive processes such as bonding appliances to the patient’s teeth adjusting archwires during the course of treatment and removing the appliances at the conclusion of treatment as such use of invisalign reduces dental professional and staff chair time and can increase practice capacity

·   practice productivity  we believe that as dental professionals move to a higher volume of invisalign patients they will be able to better leverage their existing resources including office space and staff time resulting in an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity

benefits to the patient 

·   excellent aesthetics  aligners are nearly invisible when worn significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with conventional braces

·   comfort  by replacing the sixweek adjustment cycle of traditional braces with twoweek stages aligners move teeth more gently than conventional braces also aligners are thin smooth and low in profile as a result aligners are more comfortable and less abrasive than conventional braces

·   improved oral hygiene  patients can remove aligners for tasks that are difficult with conventional braces such as eating brushing and flossing we believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal damage during treatment which may result from conventional braces

·   potentially reduced overall treatment time  aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth in addition the clincheck simulation from which aligners are produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements together these factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to conventional braces

·   potentially reduced root resorption  we believe that controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption which is the breakdown or destruction of root structure

·   reduced incidence of emergencies  typically a lost or broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in the treatment series minimizing inconvenience to both patient and dental professional

we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of conventional braces 

limitations of invisalign 

in some instances the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to conventional treatment aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in conventional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional the cost of full invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for conventional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there is generally a turnaround time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal results in addition because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech in some instances patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have occurred we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 

our target market and patient base 

we currently market invisalign to treat patients with mature dentition individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth which typically occurs between the ages of 11 and 15 years we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing as the effectiveness of invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment based on our clinical studies to date we recommend that dental professionals use invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for severe malocclusions we estimate 45 percent of the people who annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us or more than 900000 patients have mature dentition and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces persons with malocclusion will be more likely to seek treatment we believe that adults who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment represent our most immediate and significant market expansion opportunity 

in an effort to more fully penetrate our target market in august 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex cases invisalign express is a simple dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten aligners we expect invisalign express will increase the overall market for invisalign as patients who would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment due to its relatively high cost are introduced to this lowercost treatment option we continue to market and sell our traditional full invisalign treatment option for more complex cases 

as of december 31 2006 approximately 529000 patients worldwide have started treatment using invisalign internationally we operate in the geographic regions of europe asiapacific japan and latin america in 2006 international sales accounted for 16 of our net revenues a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in note 15 “segments and geographic information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

in each of fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total net revenues 

business strategy 

our objective is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic malocclusion through customer responsiveness product leadership and operational effectiveness key elements of our strategy include the following 

customer responsiveness 

focus on education and customer support   in order to build longterm relationships with our customers we focus on delivering superior training support and services each year we provide numerous clinical education and training programs which include certification classes conference calls seminars and workshops by participating in these events we believe that our customers will emerge with a better understanding of the product and its applicability and with a greater awareness for starting and finishing invisalign cases we also maintain an online clinical education center which is intended to augment our training workshops conference calls and seminars by enabling invisaligntrained doctors to obtain continuing education credits and access a full range of case studies and best practices as of december 31 2006 we had trained approximately 40800 dental professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of invisalign

educate future orthodontists and general practitioners   by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option currently we have incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of 38 university programs we expect additional dental schools to integrate the invisalign technique into their curricula in the future

stimulate demand for invisalign treatment   our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually in 2007 we expect to increase the overall marketing spending in the united states with a focus on programs designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors we also intend to initiate similar consumer marketing efforts but on a smaller scale in key european countries we believe that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase the market for our products

penetration into our domestic market   we have two customer channels the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist or gp as specialists orthodontists are a critical part of our business and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications however there exists a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists as the primary care dental provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and in certain instances may choose to treat less complex cases themselves we are committed to improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps we continue to support study clubs which pair experienced orthodontists with less experienced gps these orthodontists act as mentors to the gps and lend them support and guidance in their invisalign practice through these study clubs gps are introduced to an experienced invisalign practitioner and are able to refer appropriate cases to these orthodontists in 2007 we expect that revenue generated by gps will represent an increasingly larger percentage of our revenue largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists we believe that by focusing on increasing utilization rates among our existing gp customers the overall market for invisalign will increase as patients that would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by their gps information regarding risks related to our expectation that orthodontists and gps will collaborate may be found in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors”

product leadership 

new products and enhancements to products   our strategy for ensuring product leadership focuses on delivering new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience in 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex cases allowing the dental professional to treat a broader range of patients in the second half of 2006 we began a phased rollout of clinadvisor a new suite of software tools designed to make invisalign case selection and submission processes more efficient for doctors during 2007 we expect to extend the product features and functionality of clinadvisor to an increasing number of practices in addition we plan to introduce a further series of software enhancements that will evolve invisalign into distinct suites of software tools for the orthodontist and gp software enhancements for the orthodontist are intended to provide a more robust set of tools for greater predictability wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system software enhancements targeting the gp will focus on ease of diagnosis guidance through the case setup process and selfhelp tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion we continue to focus research and development efforts on next generation aligner material and a compliance indicator 

which efforts we expect to extend at least through 2008 next generation aligner material is intended to consistently deliver force to the teeth over a longer period of time the compliance indicator is intended to help the dental professional and the patient understand if the patient has worn their aligner for enough time to effectively move their teeth we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase demand for invisalign 

extend and defend technology leadership   invisalign represents a significant technological advancement in orthodontics our issued us patents broadly cover the invisalign system including digital modeling and manipulation of scanned patient data treatment planning and fabrication of dental appliances among others we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various countries where the invisalign system is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws information regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” see also part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings” 

operational effectiveness 

expand and enhance manufacturing capability  our manufacturing operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom aligners at a high level of quality to improve cost efficiency we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively lowwage countries we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process by continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes we plan to increase the level of production automation increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both unit costs and production times

the invisalign treatment process 

the invisalign treatment process comprises the following five stages 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us   in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches xrays of the patient’s dentition photographs of the patient a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient’s upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form or prescription the impression is a critical component of invisalign as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patient’s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patient’s teeth the prescription is also a critical component of invisalign describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our santa clara california facility

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion   upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition using ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional’s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in costa rica

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck   in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon passing review the simulation is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via virtual invisalign practice vip our proprietary customer interfacing software which is available on our websites located at wwwinvisaligncom and wwwaligntechcom  the dental professional then reviews the clincheck simulation and determines whether to ask us to make adjustments by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to review clincheck allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professional then approves the proposed treatment and in doing so engages us for the manufacture of corresponding aligners

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment   we use the approved clincheck simulation to construct a series of molds of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment these molds are fabricated by ims a third party shelter services provider based in juarez mexico

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional   from these molds ims fabricates aligners by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold the aligners are then trimmed polished cleaned and packaged following final inspection the aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental professional we ship all of the aligners in a single batch in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with toothcolored attachments bonded to the patient’s teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement in certain cases we provide an alignerlike template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s teeth also in cases where interproximal reduction or ipr is requested by the dental professional we provide an ipr treatment form quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction location and timing of ipr

manufacturing 

to produce our highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions computed tomography known as ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 

we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process in the event that either of these vendors become unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 

as of december 31 2006 our manufacturing and operations staff in the us and costa rica consisted of 672 people manufacturing is coordinated in santa clara california digital dental modeling is processed in our 63000 square foot facility in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatments using simulation software in anticipation of increased capacity demands primarily resulting from the patients first program we hired approximately 100 new dental technicians in costa rica in the fourth quarter of 2006 for a more complete discussion of the patients first program please see part i item 7 of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “management’s discussion and analysis—overview” in the second quarter of 2006 in an effort to optimize operations improve efficiency and reduce operating costs we relocated our streolithography sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara california facility to ims a third party shelter services provider based in juarez mexico we 

also use ims for the fabrication and packaging of aligners information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

throughput management 

because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continue to upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica during the first half of 2007 as a result of the increase in demand for invisalign case volume primarily due to of the patients first program discussed in part i item 7 “managements discussion and analysis—overview” we will monitor our capacity in costa rica to ensure a sufficient number of technicians have been hired we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez mexico in order to scale our manufacturing capacity we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment 

quality assurance 

align’s quality system is in compliance with food  drug administration’s medical device regulations 21cfr part 820 and health canada’s medical device regulations we are certified to en iso 134852003 internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing and of the council of canada align has a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since we custom manufacture aligners on a buildtoorder basis we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck and each aligner is unique we inspect 100 of the product at various points in the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers’ expectations aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed in the event the aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners 

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient’s dentition to us we use the impressions to create a new clincheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 

sales and marketing 

we market invisalign by communicating invisalign’s benefits directly to dental professionals through our training certification programs and direct mail campaigns and to consumers with a nationwide advertising campaign based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign in order to serve anticipated demand we are training a broad base of dental professionals 

professional marketing 

our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july 1999 in 2001 we began marketing invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market as of december 31 2006 our north america sales organization consisted of 130 people of which 109 were direct sales representatives and 21 were sales administration and management internationally we have approximately 40 people engaged in sales and sales support as december 31 2006 we provide training certification marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in the us and canada which we consider our domestic market and internationally 

as of december 31 2006 we had trained approximately 40800 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those trained dental professionals approximately 73 are dental professionals in our domestic market united states and canada within our domestic market we have trained approximately 8000 orthodontists and approximately 22000 active general practitioner dentists 

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of our website 

after training sales representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases such follow up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions establishing an internet connection and familiarizing them with our website sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

consumer marketing 

our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources 

·   an orthodontist

·   a general practice dentist

·   consumer marketing and advertising

·   our website which can be accessed at either wwwinvisaligncom or wwwaligntechcom 

·   directtoconsumer mail advertising and public relations efforts and

·   other invisalign patients

in 2007 we expect to increase the overall marketing spend in the united states with a focus on programs designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors we believe that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase demand for our product 

research and development 

our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines our research and development expenses were 185 million for fiscal 2006 186 million for fiscal 2005 and 158 million for fiscal 2004 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process we have recently started a phased roll out of clinadvisor a new suite of software tools designed to make invisalign case selection and submission processes more efficient and predictable for our doctors in addition we plan to introduce a further series of software enhancements that will evolve invisalign into distinct suites of software tools for the orthodontist and gp software enhancements for the orthodontist are intended to provide a more robust set of tools for greater predictability wider applicability and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system software enhancements targeting the gp will focus on ease of diagnosis guidance through the case setup process and selfhelp tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion we continue to focus research and development efforts on next generation aligner material and a compliance indicator which efforts we expect to extend at least through 2008 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2006 we had 85 issued us patents 120 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications see part i item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in part i item ia of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

competition 

we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets which include 3m company sybron dental specialties and dentsply international inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign including the product called red white  blue manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties in may 2006 danaher corporation purchased sybron dental specialties see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for a summary of our litigation with ormco in may 2005 orthoclear inc announced the commercial launch of the orthoclear system a product that was intended to compete directly with our invisalign system on october 13 2006 we entered into a formal agreement with orthoclear inc orthoclear holdings inc and orthoclear pakistan pvt ltd “orthoclear” together with certain 

individuals associated with orthoclear to end all pending litigation between the parties in addition orthoclear agreed among other things to stop accepting new patient cases for treatment consent to the entry of an exclusion order by the itc prohibiting the importation of orthoclear aligners into the united states assign and transfer to align all intellectual property rights with application to the correction of malocclusion and to discontinue all design manufacture marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for a summary of our litigation with orthoclear in the future we may face further competition from other early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in part i item ia of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following 

·   aesthetic appeal of the treatment method

·   effectiveness of treatment

·   customer support

·   comfort associated with the treatment method

·   oral hygiene

·   ease of use and

·   dental professionals’ chair time

we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

fda’s quality system regulation for medical devices   in 2006 we were informed by the food and drug administration or fda that our invisalign system had been reclassified as a class ii medical device the invisalign system was previously regulated as a class i medical device and was exempted from requiring 510k premarket notification prior to commercialization in 1998 however we had voluntarily filed with and subsequently received premarket clearance from the fda pursuant to the 510k premarket notification procedure allowing us to market the product in the us therefore we currently possess the necessary 510k clearance from the fda to continue to market our product under the class ii classification prior to the reclassification our product development manufacturing processes packaging labeling handling storage and distribution activities were subject to extensive oversight by the fda we believe our invisalign system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the invisalign system we do not anticipate any significant difficulty or material cost increases in complying with applicable performance standards as a result of the incremental regulatory requirements resulting from the class ii reclassification

our aligners are manufactured by ims a third party shelter services provider based in juarez mexico ims is registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturer and is certified to iso 90012000 requirements we have also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes have been implemented at ims to comply with the fda’s quality systems standards ims has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel in the manufacture and distribution of invisalign we and ims are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer 

if the fda determines that we or ims failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 

health canada’s medical device regulations   in canada we are required to comply with health canada’s medical device regulations our products are registered with health canada we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada

european union’s mdd requirements  iso 13485   in europe invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such we follow the requirements of the medical device directives we are iso 13485 certified which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996   under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information although compliance is principally the responsibility of the hospital physician or other healthcare provider we are required to maintain the confidentiality of patient information when providing technical services and when handling patient information and records we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our patients additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements

other federal and state laws   as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions under the federal antikickback statute prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers finally various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service for dentists and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions

 item 1a risk factors 

if we fail to grow our revenue while controlling our expenses the market price of our common stock may decline 

you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks expenses and difficulties encountered by a company in an early stage of operations consistent with a company in an early stage of operations we continue to incur significant operating expenses to 

·   develop new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing processes

·   execute our consumer marketing campaign and dental professional marketing efforts

·   increase the capacity of our business enterprise systems and manufacturing operations

·   execute clinical research and education plans

·   develop technological improvements to our products and new product development

·   continue our international sales and marketing efforts

·   protect our intellectual property including trade secrets and

·   undertake quality assurance and improvement initiatives

for instance in an effort to raise the profile of invisalign and match prospective patients with our most experienced dental professionals we have in the past utilized consumer marketing campaigns involving television radio and print media marketing programs of this nature are expensive and may have limited success if any and may not result in revenue generation commensurate with their costs 

in addition in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for former orthoclear patients and their doctors we committed to make invisalign treatment available to existing orthoclear patients at no charge from align through our “patients first program” as a result we will receive no revenue for any additional cases we start under this program while incurring significant expenses as well as increased demands on our sales and customer service representatives and on our manufacturing processes we currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the patients first program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 our success will depend in part on our ability to effectively integrate the orthoclear patients into our infrastructure with minimal impact on our existing and new doctors in implementing this program we experienced higher than anticipated demand from the patients first program as well as regular new patients as a result many of our customers experienced longer customer service hold times and slight delays in clincheck processing times during the fourth quarter of 2006 which we anticipate will continue during the first and second quarters of 2007 although we believe these delays are temporary in nature these difficulties could cause us to lose existing customers face potential customer disputes or limit the number of new customers who purchase our products or services this could cause a decline in our revenues gross margins and net profits and could adversely affect our operating results see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview”  

while we achieved profitability beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 and through the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we experienced a net loss in the third quarter of 2005 as well as each quarter of 2006 if we are to achieve profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our revenues while controlling our expenses while we generated positive operating cash flow for the first time in fiscal year 2003 and continued to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 we experienced negative cash flow in 2006 we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from operations from period to period in the future because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or 

otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

we have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock price 

we were incorporated in april 1997 and began sales of invisalign in july 1999 thus we have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects in addition we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing our commercial sales these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

·   changes in the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter

·   changes in product mix due to the introduction of invisalign express a lowercost alternative for treating less complex cases

·   unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity

·   any disruptions in the manufacturing process including as a result of unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes or as a result of natural or other disasters beyond our control

·   the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors

·   aggressive price competition from competitors

·   costs and expenditures in connection with ongoing litigation

·   inaccurate forecasting of revenues production and other operating costs and

·   investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to invisalign

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations for instance although we entered into a definitive agreement in october 2006 with orthoclear whereby among other things orthoclear agreed to discontinue all design manufacture marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide we experienced increased pricing pressure in 2005 and 2006 as a result of the commercial launch of orthoclear’s product partly in response to this increased competition in the fourth quarter of 2005 we changed our pricing structure and reduced our list price for full invisalign treatment to 1495 and expanded our volume based discount program to all doctors these programs were in effect in 2006 and had an adverse impact on our revenues gross margins and net profit loss most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues therefore our operating results for a given period may be adversely affected due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

we depend on the sale of invisalign for the vast majority of our revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign or average selling prices would adversely affect revenue gross margin and net profits 

we expect that revenues from the sale of invisalign will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a 

reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists and gps do not collaborate as we expect if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines as it has in the past our operating results would be harmed factors that could cause invisalign not to achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 

dental professionals may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

our success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the invisalign system by dental professionals invisalign requires orthodontists gps and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways in addition because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july 1997 and commercially available only since july 1999 orthodontists and gps may be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available also increasing adoption and cumulative use by orthodontists and gps will depend on factors such as the capability safety efficacy ease of use price quality and reliability of our products our ability to provide effective sales support training and service and the availability of competing products technologies and alternative treatments in addition unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and consequently reduced acceptance by dental professionals also increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice if invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and gp communities our operating results will be harmed 

consumers may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

our success depends upon the acceptance of invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental professionals as well as potential consumers to whom we are now actively marketing invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment in addition consumers may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for invisalign which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment we have generally received positive feedback from both orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety reliability improved treatment aesthetics greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products furthermore consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience adoption by consumers may also be affected by general macroeconomic conditions in north america and internationally which fluctuate and could be affected by unstable global economic political or other conditions 

the orthodontists and gps may choose not to collaborate and referrals between orthodontists and gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

our success depends in part upon improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gp dentists as specialists orthodontists are a critical part of our business and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications we expect however that the percentage of revenues generated by gps will increase largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists as the primary provider of dental care gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to 

invisalign have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and in certain instances may chose to treat less complex cases themselves if this collaboration and increase in referrals does not occur or occurs more slowly than we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

declines in average selling prices of our products 

in response to challenges in our business including increased competition in november 2005 we reduced the list price of full invisalign cases and in the third quarter of 2005 we introduced invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex cases in addition in the fourth quarter of 2005 we expanded our volume based discount program to all doctors as a result of these programs the blended average selling price for our products declined in 2006 compared to 2005 and may further decline in 2007 as a result of greater participation in our volume discount program additionally in europe we introduced new pricing initiatives in the first quarter of 2006 which resulted in a lower average selling price in 2006 if we are required to introduce any similar programs in the future our revenue gross margin and net profits losses may be adversely affected 

we are dependent on our international manufacturing operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds in the first quarter of 2006 we completed the process of relocating our sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara california facility to our third party shelter services provider ims located in juarez mexico ims also fabricates the aligners and ships the completed products to our customers as a result of this relocation our reliance on our international manufacturing operations will continue to increase our increasing reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

·   difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations as well as staffing in numbers sufficient to implement the patients first program

·   difficulties in managing international operations including our relationship with ims our third party shelter services provider

·   import and export license requirements and restrictions

·   controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process

·   political social and economic instability

·   acts of terrorism and acts of war

·   interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services

·   product or material transportation delays or disruption

·   burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws

·   trade restrictions and changes in tariffs

·   fluctuations in currency exchange rates and

·   potential adverse tax consequences

if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 

a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth and fail to hire sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand the delivery time of our product could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 

training technicians to use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the electronic treatment forms that form the basis of clincheck takes approximately 90 to 120 days as a result if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely create clincheck treatment forms within the timeframe our customers expect any delay in clincheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished aligners to our customers such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or limit the number of new customers who purchase our products this could cause a decline in our revenue and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our headquarters clincheck setup and other manufacturing processes are all principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 

our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software in addition our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated by ims our third party shelter services provider located in juarez mexico both costa rica and mexico are earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located our ability to create clincheck treatment plans or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners in addition our headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area a earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process and if our access to these inputs is diminished our business may be harmed 

we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process we rely on ims a third party shelter services provider located in juarez mexico to fabricate aligner molds as well as finished aligners and to ship the completed product to customers if ims fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by ims with respect to hiring and retaining qualified personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible 

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our invisalign product competes directly against a product called red white and blue which is manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a division of sybron dental specialties in may 2006 danaher corporation purchased sybron dental specialties prior to orthoclear agreeing pursuant to the terms of an agreement entered into in october 2006 to discontinue all design manufacture marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide our invisalign system competed 

directly with an aligner product manufactured by them in addition manufacturers of traditional braces such as 3m company sybron dental specialties and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed increased competition from orthoclear and other competitors recently resulted in and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue volume growth net profit and stock price for instance in the fourth quarter of 2005 in order to encourage continued use of our products we extended our volume based discount program to all of our doctors in addition in the second half of 2005 we introduced invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex cases as well as a new pricing initiative which had the effect of reducing our average selling price per case these programs have adversely affected our revenues gross margin and net profit we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations revenues and operating results 

in addition our data center operations are located in our headquarters in santa clara california we are in the process of moving our data center operations and changing our data center infrastructure we expect the move to be completed over the next two years we may experience technical difficulties in connection with these changes if we experience a system failure or disruption for any reason including in connection with changes in our data center location or infrastructure the performance of our website would be harmed and our service could shut down 

throughout 2006 we focused on adding additional functionality into our business enterprise systems and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future which will more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

furthermore we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically clincheck and vip software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released the discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition or results of operations 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2006 we had 85 issued us patents 120 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products during fiscal 2005 and 2006 requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office “uspto” by a san francisco california law firm acting on behalf of an unnamed party and in some instances acting on behalf of orthoclear requesting reexamination of a number of our patents see part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of the uspto proceedings in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur see part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of the orthoclear litigation our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share 

in addition in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation for example in october 2006 we entered into an agreement with orthoclear whereby orthoclear and align agreed among other things to dismiss all pending lawsuits against each other including the patent infringement action against orthoclear filed in the western district of wisconsin madison in addition we are currently involved in a patent infringement lawsuit with ormco the potential effects on our business operations resulting from similar litigation that we may participate in the future whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

in addition we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations in addition litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price see part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop obtain regulatory approval or clearance of manufacture and market new products in the second half of 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost aligner system used for less complex cases we recently announced a phased rollout of clinadvisor a new suite of software tools designed to make invisalign case selection and submission processes more efficient for doctors in addition we plan to introduce a further series of software enhancements that will evolve invisalign into distinct suites of software tools for the orthodontist and gp there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things price safety efficacy reliability marketing and sales efforts the availability of thirdparty reimbursement of procedures using our new products the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration or fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business will be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular we are committed to purchase all of our resin from a singlesource and our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by single suppliers technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we have experienced rapid growth and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business 

we have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in 1999 our headcount increased from approximately 50 employees as of december 31 1999 to 1253 employees as of december 31 2006 this expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the us and internationally in particular growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas including recruiting and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel providing adequate training and 

supervision to maintain our high quality standards and preserving our culture and values our inability to effectively manage growth could harm our business 

we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our domestic and international markets as of december 31 2006 our north america sales organization consisted of 130 people of which 109 were direct sales representatives and 21 were sales administration and management internationally we have approximately 40 people engaged in sales and sales support as december 31 2006 we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services of these key personnel may harm our business if we are unable retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to reestablish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed 

complying with regulations enforced by the food and drug administration fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

·   product design development manufacture and testing

·   product labeling

·   product storage

·   premarket clearance or approval

·   advertising and promotion and

·   product sales and distribution

our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

·   warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties

·   repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products

·   operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production

·   refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products

·   withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and

·   criminal prosecution

if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections we and ims our third party shelter services provider have not yet been subject to an fda inspection and we cannot assure you we or ims will successfully pass such an inspection in the future our failure or the failure of ims to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to 

comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

·   storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records

·   prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and

·   the marketing and advertising of our products

complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

we currently sell our products in europe canada mexico brazil australia hong kong and japan and may expand into other countries from time to time we do not know whether orthodontists gps and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate in addition sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

in fiscal 2006 and during the first two months of fiscal 2007 the market price for our common stock was volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

·   quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity

·   changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results

·   speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations

·   strategic actions by our competitors such as product announcements or acquisitions

·   announcements of technological innovations or new products by us our customers or competitors and

·   general market conditions

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future we would incur substantial legal fees and our management’s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

·   revenue recognition

·   accounting for sharebased payments and

·   accounting for income taxes

in particular the fasb recently enacted sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “fas 123r” which we adopted effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 see note 10 “shareholders’ equity” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the impact of fas 123r on our reported financial results 

we have made use of a shareholders rights’ plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders to date our board of directors has designated 200000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of the company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights’ plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan

 item 2   properties 

our headquarters are located in santa clara california we lease approximately 127000 square feet of space where we house our customer support operations research and development and administrative personnel we lease our santa clara facilities under four leases which expire in june 2010 the combined monthly rent for the santa clara facilities is approximately 75000 commencing july 1 2005 and continuing on the first day of each calendar month thereafter 11000 will be deducted from the 13 million security deposit previously paid by us to the lessor and such amount will be applied against the monthly base rent for the santa clara facilities 

we operate a facility in san jose costa rica the facility comprises approximately 63000 square feet of manufacturing and office space the monthly rent for the costa rica facility is approximately 59000 the lease for this facility expires at the end of 2008 

our european headquarters are located in amsterdam the netherlands the facility comprises approximately 11000 square feet of office space the monthly rent for the amsterdam facility is approximately 33000 the lease for this facility expires in 2014 with an option to terminate with a fee of 238000 during 2009 we expect this lease will not be renewed beyond 2009 

we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations 




 litigating claims of the types discussed in note 5 “legal proceedings” of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part ii item 3 “legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

price range of common stock 

our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol “algn” public trading of our common stock commenced on january 26 2001 prior to that date there was no public market for our common stock the following table shows for the periods indicated the high and low per share closing prices of our common stock as reported by the nasdaq global market 

 

  

on march 6 2007 the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market was 1640 per share as of march 6 2007 there were approximately 228 holders of record of our common stock because the majority of our shares of outstanding common stock is held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future our credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants including restriction on our ability to pay dividends see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources”

notwithstanding any statement to the contrary in any of our previous or future filings with the sec the following information relating to the price performance of our common stock shall not be deemed “filed” with the sec or “soliciting material” under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or subject to regulation 14a or 14c or to liabilities of section 18 of the exchange act except to the extent we specifically request that such information be treated as soliciting material or to the extent we specifically incorporate this information by reference 

the following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with that of the nasdaq stock market us index a broad market index published by the national association of securities dealers inc and a peer group that we believe in good faith is an appropriate basis for comparison since it reflects the labor market in which align competes the comparison for each of the periods assumes that 100 was invested on january 1 2002 in our common stock the stocks included in the nasdaq stock market us index and the stocks included the peer group index and that all dividends were reinvested

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

align technology founded in april 1997 designs manufactures and markets invisalign a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition we received fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998 and we began commercial operations and sales of full invisalign treatment in july 1999 

each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient our full invisalign treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck in order to achieve the doctors’ treatment goals in the third quarter of 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowcost solution for less complex orthodontic cases invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment for cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and consist of up to ten aligners invisalign express is intended to assist dental professionals to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lower cost option for adult relapse cases minor crowding and spacing or as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatment such as veneers 

we generate the vast majority of our revenues from the sales of the invisalign system which includes full invisalign treatment and invisalign express to orthodontists and gps in the united states and canada our domestic market sales of the invisalign system in our domestic gp channel and our domestic orthodontic channel represented approximately 45 and 33 of our total net revenues during fiscal 2006 respectively our domestic full invisalign and invisalign express revenues represented 66 and 13 of our total net revenue during 2006 respectively our international revenues represented 16 of our total net revenue during fiscal 2006 

a number of factors the most important of which are set forth below may affect our results during the remainder of 2007 and beyond 

·   settlement with orthoclear in the fourth quarter of 2006 we entered into a formal agreement with orthoclear inc orthoclear holdings inc and orthoclear pakistan pvt ltd “orthoclear” together with certain individuals associated with orthoclear the “orthoclear agreement” to end all pending litigation between the parties in addition orthoclear agreed among other things to stop accepting new patient cases for treatment consent to the entry of an exclusion order by the itc prohibiting the importation of orthoclear aligners into the united states assign and transfer to align all intellectual property rights with application to the correction of malocclusion and to discontinue all design manufacture marketing and sales of removable dental aligners worldwide certain orthoclear principles also signed five year noncompete agreements in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement we made a onetime cash payment of 200 million to orthoclear holdings inc see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k for a more complete summary of the orthoclear agreement during the fourth quarter of 2006 we engaged a thirdparty firm to assist us in assessing the value of the assets received in conjunction with the orthoclear agreement based on this valuation 140 million of the 200 million we paid to orthoclear represented the fair value of the noncompete agreements these intangible assets were capitalized on our balance sheet and are being amortized over 5 years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2006 the intellectual property transferred to us was determined not to have any 

alternative future use and therefore had no fair value we recorded the remaining 60 million as settlement costs through the orthoclear agreement we achieved our primary objectives in the litigation as well as eliminated the costs and risks of protracted litigation as a result of the orthoclear agreement we expect our legal expenses will be reduced significantly in fiscal 2007 and our management and technical personnel will be able to refocus their energy and resources on our customers and product development 

·   “patients first program” as part of the orthoclear agreement orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide as a result most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for these patients and their doctors we committed to make invisalign treatment available to orthoclear patients at no additional charge from align therefore we will receive no revenue for any additional cases we start under this program while incurring significant expenses in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recorded an expense of 83 million for the anticipated cost of completing this program this amount is based on the number of orthoclear cases registered under the patients first program as of december 31 2006 and the estimated costs that will be incurred in order to fulfill our obligations as a result of this program if the actual number of orthoclear cases under the program changes or the actual costs differ significantly from our estimates we would be required to adjust the accrual for the patient’s first program which could materially impact our financial statements as of december 31 2006 68 million remained in accrued liabilities for this program

additionally this program has generated increased demands on our sales and customer service representatives and on our manufacturing processes including increased headcount in the fourth quarter of 2006 we hired approximately 100 additional dental technicians at our facility in costa rica training these technicians to use the sophisticated computer modeling program necessary to create clincheck treatment forms takes approximately 90 to 120 days therefore although we hired these additional technicians in the fourth quarter of 2006 these individuals were not able to provide meaningful contribution to our manufacturing process until the beginning of 2007 as a result of this manufacturing constraint although we initially sought to implement the patients first program without impacting our existing customers or new paid invisalign cases the influx of patients first program cases as well as a higher than expected number of paid invisalign case submissions in the fourth quarter caused a delay in clincheck preparation time for some new cases by approximately 10 days difficulties such as these in managing the deployment of this program could cause us to lose existing customers face potential customer disputes or limit the number of new customers who purchase our products or services as well as result in lost or delayed revenue which could cause a decline in our revenues gross margins and net profits and adversely affect our operating results we currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the patients first program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 we expect that as we complete the patients first program cases the incremental capacity and workforce created as a result of this program will be utilized by the anticipated increase in paid invisalign cases 

·   penetration into our domestic market   as specialists orthodontists are a critical part of our business and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications however there exists a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists as the primary provider of dental care gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients on the benefits of oral care and introduce them to invisalign gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and may choose to treat less complex cases themselves largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists we expect that an increasingly larger percentage of our revenues will be 

generated by gps in fact in fiscal 2006 our domestic gp channel generated 45 of our total net revenue while the orthodontic channel represented 33 we continue to believe that by focusing on increasing utilization rates among our existing gp customers the overall market for invisalign will increase as patients who would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by their gps in 2007 we expect to increase the overall marketing spend in the united states with a focus on programs designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced doctors we anticipate that this increased consumer awareness of invisalign will increase the market for our product in addition by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option as of december 31 2006 we have integrated the invisalign technique into the curriculums of 38 university programs including harvard university columbia university temple university and the university of texas at san antonio we expect additional dental schools to integrate the invisalign technique into their curriculums in the future 

·   product mix in the third quarter of 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowcost solution for less complex orthodontic cases in the fourth quarter of 2006 we experienced a decline in the number of invisalign express cases as compared to the third quarter of 2006 although we expect that the number of invisalign express cases in the first quarter of 2007 will be relatively consistent compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 we expect to see an increasing number of invisalign express cases during the remaining quarters of 2007

·   continued product leadership  we are committed to investing in delivering new products enhancing the user experience and introducing new product features to our existing products in addition to invisalign express launched in 2005 in the second half of 2006 we announced a phased rollout of clinadvisor a new suite of software tools designed to make invisalign case selection and submission processes more efficient for doctors during 2007 we expect to extend the product features and functionality of clinadvisor and release it to an increasing number of practices in addition we plan to introduce further software enhancements directed at our more experienced doctors that will provide these doctors with a robust set of tools for greater predictability wider applicability and more control we are also continuing to focus our research and development efforts on a next generation aligner material as well as a compliance indicator which will help doctors and patients understand if the patients have worn their aligners for enough time to effectively move their teeth we expect these efforts to extend at least through 2008 by investing in developing these new products and continually enhancing our existing products we expect to increase market share

·   expansion of international markets we will focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in key international markets including europe and japan we will consider expanding into additional countries on a case by case basis in 2006 our international channel represented approximately 16 of our total net revenue primarily as a result of growth in europe in 2007 we expect to increase our consumer marketing efforts in key european markets we expect our international revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollars and we expect international revenue as a percentage of total net revenue will be comparable in the foreseeable future

·   increasing reliance on international manufacturing operations our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica dental technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds in 

addition we use ims a third party based in juarez mexico for the fabrication and packaging of aligners our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of management to effectively manage these international operations including our relationship with ims in addition we currently are and will become increasingly dependant on ims’s and our ability to hire and retain employees generally as well as hire and retain employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations if our management andor ims fail in any of these respects we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue in addition even if we have case submissions in the manufacturing backlog if for these or other reasons we do not have sufficient number of trained dental technicians in costa rica to create the clincheck treatment forms or if ims is unable to ship our product to our customers on a timely basis our revenue will be delayed or lost which will cause our operating results to fluctuate see part i item 1a—risk factors for risks related to our international operations  

stockbased compensation   effective january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “fas 123r” using the modified prospective transition method which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to our employees and directors and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values over the requisite service period in accordance with the modified prospective method our financial statements for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of fas 123r for the year ended december 31 2006 stockbased compensation expense recognized in accordance with fas 123r is as follows in thousands

revenues 

our total net revenues decreased by 07 million or 04 to 2064 million in 2006 compared to 2071 million in 2005 the decline in total net revenues resulted from reduced revenues in the orthodontic channel offset by increases in the gp channel international and other revenues in 2006 the domestic orthodontic and gp channels were impacted by lower overall average selling prices due to new pricing initiatives and the fullyear effect of our lowerpriced invisalign express product all of which were introduced in the second half of 2005 

invisalign product revenues by channel and other revenue which represented training and sales of ancillary products for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 are as follows

1   invisalign express was launched in the third quarter of 2005

revenues from our domestic orthodontic channel decreased 168 million or 196 in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of a decline in full invisalign revenues of 243 million partially offset by a 75 million increase in invisalign express revenues the decline in full invisalign revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices and case volumes in 2006 the reduced average selling price of the full invisalign product reflects the full year impact of pricing initiatives introduced in the second half of 2005 including the reduction in the list price of our full invisalign product and the expansion of our volume based discount program additionally the increase in invisalign express revenue resulted from higher case volumes in 2006 compared to 2005 since this product was launched in the third quarter of 2005 

revenues from our domestic gp channel increased 48 million or 53 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase in invisalign express revenues of 124 million partially offset by a 76 million 

decline in full invisalign revenues invisalign express revenues increased resulting from higher case volumes in 2006 compared to 2005 since this product was launched in the third quarter of 2005 the reduction in full invisalign revenues is attributed to lower average selling prices which reflect the full year impact of the pricing initiatives mentioned above 

international revenues increased 89 million or 383 in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a significant increase in our international invisalign case volumes partially offset by a lower average selling price as a result of pricing initiatives introduced in the first quarter of 2006 

other revenues which primarily consisted of training and sales of ancillary products increased 24 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 2005 mainly due to a 18 million increase in training revenues resulting from an increase in training fees 

net revenue grew by 198 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the growth in net revenues resulted primarily from an increase in overall case shipment volume in the domestic gp channel driven by an increase in the number of participating clinicians and the launch of invisalign express in the third quarter of 2005 additionally our international sales improved primarily as a result of increased number of participating clinicians and case utilization by our european practitioners 

for fiscal year 2007 we expect our total net revenues will increase compared to 2006 primarily due to the anticipated case volume increases in our domestic orthodontic and gp channels as well as in international markets we expect our average selling price to be flat to slightly lower compared to 2006 primarily due to increased participation in our volume based discount programs 

cost of revenues 

 

  

cost of revenues includes salaries for staff involved in the production process costs incurred by ims a third party shelter service provider in juarez mexico the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process training costs and stockbased compensation expense 

gross margin decreased to 686 of net revenues in 2006 compared to 692 in 2005 primarily due to lower average selling prices this decline in average selling prices is attributable to the reduction in the list price of full invisalign and increased sales of our lower priced invisalign express product reductions in product costs driven by increased volumes and manufacturing efficiencies including the relocation of the sla mold operations to juarez mexico partially offset the impact of lower average selling prices in addition as a result of these efficiencies we also released a 22 million provision for estimated losses on case refinement sales during fiscal 2006 

gross margin improved to 692 of net revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 compared to 667 of net revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 this improvement in gross margin is primarily the result of cost savings achieved from manufacturing process improvements and increased cost absorption due to higher production volumes partially offset by increased training costs as a result of dental professionals auditing training classes for no charge 

for the fiscal year 2007 we anticipate that our gross margin will be slightly higher compared to 2006 primarily due to impact of the expected increase in case volume and manufacturing efficiencies including a full year effect of the relocation of the sla mold operations to juarez mexico 

sales and marketing 

 

  

sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation combined with travel related costs and expenses for professional marketing programs conducting workshops and market surveys advertising dental professional trade show attendance and stockbased compensation expense 

sales and marketing expense increased 19 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 28 million increase in payroll expense mainly attributable to an increase in headcount and the replacement of orthodontic sales representatives who left align in the first half of 2005 and a 29 million increase in stockbased compensation expense these increases were partially offset by a 39 million decrease in media advertising and other marketing expenses due to the initial launch of our consumer marketing campaign in the second quarter of 2005 

sales and marketing expense increased by 242 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was primarily related to incremental headcount which resulted in higher payroll costs of 103 million 67 million related to increased advertising media and trade show costs an additional 48 million on outside services and other sales and marketing support costs and 24 million of expenses attributable to retention incentives and guarantees paid to our sales force in response to the solicitation of our sales force by orthoclear during the first quarter of 2005 

for fiscal 2007 we expect sales and marketing expense including stockbased compensation to be slightly higher than 2006 as we expand our international markets continue to increase our investment in media programs and provide clinical education 

general and administrative 

 

  

general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel outside consulting services legal expenses and stockbased compensation expense 

general and administrative expense increased by 221 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 150 million increase in external legal fees primarily related to the orthoclear litigation a 38 million increase in payroll related expenses primarily resulting from the hiring of additional legal and administrative staff and a 40 million increase in stockbased compensation expense partially offsetting these increases was a 08 million decrease in bad debt expense 

general and administrative expense increased by 83 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to incremental expenses related to the orthoclear litigation which included a 58 million increase in external legal fees a 13 million increase in consulting costs and a 32 million increase in payroll expense for employee retention and the hiring of additional legal staff this increase was partially offset by a 26 million decrease in stockbased compensation expense in connection with the amortization of deferred stockbased compensation related to option grants prior to 2001 

for fiscal year 2007 we expect that general and administrative expense will decrease from fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of the significant reduction in legal and other expenses following the settlement agreement we entered into with orthoclear in the fourth quarter of 2006 

research and development 

 

  

research and development expense includes the personnel costs associated with software engineering the cost of designing developing and testing our products conducting clinical and postmarketing trials and stockbased compensation expense we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 

research and development expense decreased 01 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 14 million decrease in temporary services and outside consulting expenses partially offset by 13 million increase in stockbased compensation 

research and development expense increased by 28 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the primary reasons for the higher expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 were an increase of 13 million in outside service and consulting expenses 11 million of additional payroll related costs due to higher headcount and a 04 million increase in training and other research and development expenses 

for fiscal 2007 we expect research and development spending to increase from fiscal 2006 as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to bring new products to market conduct clinical research and focus on product improvement initiatives 

patients first program and settlement costs 

 

  

patients first program and settlement costs consisted of a 83 million charge for anticipated costs of patients first program combined with 60 million in settlement cost for a total of 143 million this amount is separately disclosed on our december 31 2006 consolidated statement of operations 

as part of the orthoclear agreement orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide as a result most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear in an attempt to help 

minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the “patients first program” we will receive no revenue for the program and will incur significant expense to complete these cases in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recorded an 83 million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program in accordance with fasb statement 5 “accounting for contingencies” “fas 5” this amount is based on the number of orthoclear cases registered under the patients first program as of december 31 2006 and the estimated costs that will be incurred to fulfill our obligations as a result of this program if the actual number of orthoclear cases under the program changes or the actual costs differs significantly from our estimates we would be required to adjust the accrual for the patients first program and it could materially impact our financial statements we currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the patients first program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 

we paid 200 million to orthoclear during the fourth quarter of 2006 in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement of which 140 million was capitalized on our balance sheet representing the fair value of the noncompete agreements and is being amortized over 5 years in accordance with emerging issues task force 0401 “accounting for preexisting contractual relationships between the parties to a purchase business combination” eitf 0401 we recorded the remaining 60 million as settlement costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

interest and other income expense net 

 

  

interest and other income expense net includes interest income earned on cash balances interest expense on debt foreign currency translation gains and losses for the dollar against other currencies related to international businesses and other miscellaneous charges 

interest income expense net for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 11 million compared to 2005 the increase was primarily due to increased interest income as a result of higher effective interest rates 

other income expense increased 20 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to a 21 million increase in foreign currency translation gains resulted primarily from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 

interest and other income and expenses for the year ended december 31 2005 included interest income of 19 million which resulted from higher interest rates and average cash balances during 2005 offset by exchange losses of 10 million and 06 million of interest expense bank charges and other expense 

income tax provision 

 

  

we recorded an income tax provision of 08 million for fiscal 2006 13 million for fiscal 2005 and 10 million in fiscal 2004 representing effective tax rates of 24 482 and 102 for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively as of december 31 2006 we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing deferred tax assets due to uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize these assets before they expire as a result our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 

at december 31 2006 we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 2149 million for federal tax purposes and 735 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized these carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 for federal purposes and 2007 for california purposes sfas 123r prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled 141 million as of december 31 2006 and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation’s tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes if an ownership change is determined to have occurred our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation however based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december 31 2006 and our current estimate of the annual limitation we do not expect our net operating loss carryforwards to be limited at december 31 2006 we had research credit carryforwards of approximately 40 million for federal purposes and 54 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely

we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december 31 2006 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock from cash generated from sales of our product and occasional borrowing under available credit facilities as of december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we had the following cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

  

net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2006 was 140 million resulting primarily from our operating loss of 350 million adjusted for noncash items such as depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation totaling 192 million additionally a 64 million increase in current assets and a 58 million reduction in deferred revenue partially offset by a 143 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the cash used in operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 was 161 million primarily from operating profits adjusted for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities partially offset by reductions in accounts payable 

net cash used in investing activities was 328 million for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily due to a 140 million purchase of intangible assets resulting from the orthoclear agreement 100 million for the purchase of capital assets and 89 million net purchase of shortterm marketable securities we used 153 million of cash for our investing activities during the year ended december 31 2005 this included 138 million of cash used to purchase capital assets and 09 million of net cash used to purchase general orthodontics llc 

net cash provided by financing activities was 277 million for the year ended december 31 2006 and primarily consisted of 162 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options and 115 million in net proceeds from our line of credit net cash provided by financing activities was 37 million for the year ended december 31 2005 which consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options partially offset by payments on debt obligations related to the equipmentbased term loan and capital lease obligations 

net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity however in 2006 we began granting rsus which unlike stock options do not generate cash from exercise in addition because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest the number of shares we issued to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable payroll withholding taxes which taxes will be paid by us on their behalf as a result we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods 

in december 2005 we renegotiated and amended our existing revolving line of credit to increase the available borrowings under the then existing revolving line to 200 million included in the revolving line of credit is a letter of credit facility of up to 5 million a foreign exchange facility of up to 5 million and an equipment facility of up to 10 million we may elect interest rates on our borrowing calculated by reference to bank’s prime rate less onehalf of one percent or libor plus two percent the credit facility matures on december 16 2007 at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid the credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants including among others financial covenants requiring a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net worth and covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets make acquisitions be acquired incur indebtedness grant liens make investments pay dividends and repurchase stock in december 2006 we amended our credit agreement whereby the only financial covenant for the fourth quarter of 2006 was a certain minimum cash balance as of december 31 2006 we are in compliance with the financial covenant of these credit facilities 

during the third quarter of 2006 we borrowed 150 million against these credit facilities and made a 200 million onetime payment to orthoclear holdings inc in accordance with the terms of the orthoclear agreement we elected libor plus two percent as an interest rate of 729 as of december 31 2006 we repaid 35 million of this borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2006 the outstanding balance as of december 31 2006 was 115 million and is classified as current liability 

on march 7 2007 we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank the amendment among other things reduced financial covenants to require only a quick ratio covenant additionally the amendment also increased the available borrowings under the existing revolving line of credit from 20 million to 25 million effective january 1 2008 the amended credit facility matures on december 31 2008 at which point all outstanding borrowing under this credit facility must be repaid 

contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2006 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands 

 

1   includes an early termination fee on facility in amsterdam the netherlands the lease expires in 2014 with an option to cancel in 2009

we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation sk item 303a4 as of december 31 2006 

we expect that our expense levels for 2007 will remain comparable to 2006 depending on our level of business activity we expect that any increases will be focused on continued marketing and international sales efforts and research and development expenses as we develop new products and improvements to our existing products in addition we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market sell and support our products on a worldwide basis 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we could be required to delay establishing a national brand building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology and reduce our expenditures in general accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we enter into arrangements to sell products services and other arrangements that contain multiple elements or multiple deliverables of products in the future revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured revenues from product sales net of discounts and rebates are recognized upon shipment service revenues are recorded when performance is completed other revenue arrangements with multiple elements are recognized as delivery occurs we use vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the undelivered elements and recognize the residual revenue for the delivered items upon shipment revenues for the undelivered elements are deferred based on a historical case refinement utilization rate or breakage factor and are recognized when delivery occurs actual utilization rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue in addition changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition but would not change the total revenue recognized 

stockbased compensation expense 

effective january 1 2006 we adopted the modified prospective transition method of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “fas 123r” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including stock options and restricted stock units related to our 2001 plan and our 2005 plan and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values over requisite employee service period in accordance with the modified prospective transition method our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect and do not include the impact of fas 123r our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 reflect the impact of fas 123r related to sharebased payment awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of december 31 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of fasb statement 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” “fas 123” and stockbased payment awards granted subsequent to december 31 2005 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas 123r in conjunction with the adoption of fas 123r we changed our method of attributing the value of stockbased compensation to expense from the accelerated multipleoption approach to the straightline single option method 

we estimate the fair value of stock options using a blackscholes valuation model consistent with the provisions of fas 123r and the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” optionpricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term and stock price volatility judgment is also required in estimating the number of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited as stockbased compensation expense recognized in our financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures fas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience if our estimates change or if we employ different assumptions in the application of fas 123r in future periods the compensation expense that we record under fas 123r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially impact our results of operations see note 10 “shareholders’ equity” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

on october 6 2005 the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting for all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than 710 options held by nonemployee directors were excluded from the vesting acceleration the fair market value of our 

common stock on the date of acceleration was 641 as quoted on the nasdaq global market as a result of the acceleration approximately 38 million options or 35 of the then total outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of october 6 2005 the purpose of the acceleration was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of fas 123r 

longlived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets 

intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of the respective asset intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets “fas 144” we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for its business significant negative industry or economic trends andor a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses no intangible asset impairment was recorded for the periods presented 

patients first program 

as part of the orthoclear settlement agreement orthoclear agreed to stop the importation of aligners into the united states and discontinue all aligner business operations worldwide as a result most orthoclear patients were unable to complete their orthodontic treatment with orthoclear in an attempt to help minimize treatment disruptions for the orthoclear patients and their doctors we committed to make treatment available to these patients at no additional cost under the “patients first program” we will receive no revenue for the program and will incur significant expense to complete these cases in the fourth quarter of 2006 we recorded s 83 million charge for the anticipated costs of completing this program in accordance with fasb statement 5 “accounting for contingencies” “fas 5” this amount is based on the number of orthoclear cases registered under the patients first program as of december 31 2006 and the estimated costs that will be incurred to fulfill our obligations as a result of this program if the actual number of orthoclear cases under the program changes or the actual costs differs significantly from our estimates we would be required to adjust the accrual for the patients first program and it could materially impact our financial statements we currently anticipate that we will be able to complete the patients first program by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 

product warranty 

we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship until the invisalign case is completed we accrue for estimated warranty in costs of goods sold upon the shipment of products the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts we regularly review the accrued balances and update these balances based on historical warranty cost trends actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued if we were to experience higher rates of warranty events we would be required to accrue additional warranty costs which would negatively affect our operating results 

deferred tax valuation allowance 

we have established a full valuation allowance because we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is not likely deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance 

while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance we would decrease the valuation allowance to take into account deferred tax assets that we could realize a decrease in the valuation allowance could have a favorable impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the decrease 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 1 “summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition which is incorporated herein 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable equity securities due to the short duration of our cash and cash equivalents an immediate 10 decrease or more in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows periodically we invest our excess cash in low risk and shortterm available for sale marketable equity securities these investments are primarily at fixed interest rates as of december 31 2006 we had 89 million investments in available for sale marketable equity securities 

as of december 31 2006 we had 115 million outstanding borrowing against our line of credit which bears interest rate of libor plus two percent being 729 as of december 31 2006 and are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases an increase of 10 or more in interest rates may affect our future cost of financing in the past we had used fixed rates longterm financing to minimize our risk on interest rates increases 

currency rate risk 

the functional currency of align and its subsidiaries is the us dollar and accordingly gains and losses resulting from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euro cost rican colon and other currencies are reflected in the determination of net income or loss we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses included in other income expense for the year ended december 31 2006 was an exchanges gain of 11 million for years 2005 and 2004 we experienced exchange loss of 10 million and an exchange gain of 03 million respectively primarily related to euro denominated balances an aggregate decline of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to usd may have an adverse effect of approximately 12 million on our results of operations and financial position

 item 1 business 

our company 

align technology inc was incorporated in april 1997 under the laws of the state of delaware we design manufacture and market the invisalign® system a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition align technology received fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998 

under the corporate informationinvestor relations section of our corporate website which can be accessed at either wwwaligntechcom or wwwinvisaligncom  we make our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k our proxy statement on schedule 14a for our annual stockholders’ meeting and amendments to such reports available as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission or sec all such filings are available free of charge the information in or that can be accessed through our web site is not part of this report 

industry background 

malocclusion 

malocclusion the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting over 200 million individuals or approximately 75 of the us population approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional treatment 

traditional orthodontic treatment 

in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patient’s teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices 

the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient’s teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement because of the length of time between visits the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient’s teeth 

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us 3500 to 7000 with a median fee of approximately 4800 generally only a portion of the fees are reimbursed by insurance if covered at all in addition dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional’s estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time or reduced profitability for the dental professional 

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment 

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

·   unattractive appearance  braces call attention to the patient’s condition and treatment in addition braces trap food which can further compromise appearance braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth many adults associate braces with adolescence as a result of these and other limitations less than one percent of american adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually

·   oral discomfort  braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth the tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit

·   poor oral hygiene  braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more difficult to brush and floss these problems can result in tooth decay and periodontal damage additionally the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth

·   inability to project treatment  historically dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment accordingly dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment as a result they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits this lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professional’s ability to estimate the duration of treatment because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental professional

·   physical demands on dental professional  the manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional

·   root resorption  the sustained high levels of force associated with conventional treatment can result in root resorption which is a shortening of tooth roots this shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient

·   emergencies  at times braces need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional

due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability 

the align solution 

invisalign which includes full invisalign treatment and invisalign® express discussed below under “our products” is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion the invisalign treatment process is comprised of several phases the principal steps of which are the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck® and the manufacturing of invisalign aligners referred to in this form 10k as “aligners” the complete invisalign treatment process is described in greater detail under “business—the invisalign treatment process” 

clincheck   clincheck is an internally developed computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients we use a dental impression and a treatment form submitted by a dental professional to develop a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments clincheck allows the dental professional to view this threedimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly clincheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible

upon review of the clincheck simulation the dental professional may immediately approve the projected treatment or may provide us with feedback for modification we reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck simulation we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to manufacture aligner molds a third party shelter services provider in juarez mexico uses these molds to fabricate the patient’s aligners 

aligners   aligners are custommanufactured thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck each aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment simulation after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use an invisalign retainer or go directly to a conventional retainer

our products 

the vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of full invisalign treatment and invisalign® express treatment approximately 5 of our revenue is generated by the sale of training and the sale of ancillary products 

full invisalign treatment   commercial sales of full invisalign treatment commenced in the us in july 1999 our traditional full invisalign treatment option is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and the treatment plan will consist of as many aligners as is necessary to achieve the doctor’s treatment goals

invisalign express   in the third quarter of 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex orthodontic cases invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment consisting of up to ten aligners invisalign express is intended to help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic treatment by providing a lowercost option for adult relapse cases for minor crowding and spacing and as a precursor to restorative or cosmetic treatment such as veneers

benefits of invisalign 

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces 

benefits to the dental professional 

·   ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes  clincheck enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely outcome of treatment in an interactive threedimensional computer model clincheck allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient

·   begin using invisalign with minimal additional training  the biomechanical principles that underlie treatment with the invisalign system are consistent with those of traditional orthodontics dental professionals can complete our initial training within two days we provide additional clinical support following the initial training and encourage dental professionals to attend continuing education classes seminars and workshops

·   expanded patient base  we believe that invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics currently approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us these patients represent approximately 1 percent of the population of people with malocclusion of these we estimate approximately 40 percent or approximately 800000 patients have mature dentition with mild to moderate malocclusion and are therefore potential candidates 

for invisalign we believe that invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment 

·   decreased dental professional and staff time  invisalign eliminates the need for timeintensive processes such as bonding appliances to the patient’s teeth adjusting archwires during the course of treatment and removing the appliances at the conclusion of treatment as such use of invisalign reduces dental professional and staff chair time and can increase practice throughput

·   practice productivity  we believe that as dental professionals move to a higher volume of invisalign patients they will be able to better leverage their existing resources including office space and staff time resulting in an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity

benefits to the patient 

·   excellent aesthetics  aligners are nearly invisible when worn significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with conventional braces

·   comfort  by replacing the sixweek adjustment cycle of traditional braces with twoweek stages aligners move teeth more gently than conventional braces also aligners are thin smooth and low in profile as a result aligners are substantially more comfortable and less abrasive than conventional braces

·   improved oral hygiene  patients can remove aligners for tasks that are difficult with conventional braces such as eating brushing and flossing we believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal damage during treatment which may result from conventional braces

·   potentially reduced overall treatment time  aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth in addition the clincheck simulation from which aligners are produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements together these factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to conventional braces

·   potentially reduced root resorption  we believe that controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption which is the breakdown or destruction of root structure

·   reduced incidence of emergencies  typically a lost or broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in the treatment series minimizing inconvenience to both patient and dental professional

we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of conventional braces 

limitations of invisalign 

in some instances the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to conventional treatment aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in conventional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional the cost of full invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for conventional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there is generally a turnaround time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal results in addition because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech in 

some instances patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have occurred we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 

our target market and patient base 

medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness class i or ii devices require the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification to the food and drug administration or the fda requesting permission for commercial distribution which is known as 510k clearance we obtained our 510k clearance in september 1998 our 510k clearance allows us to market invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion provided that the patient has mature dentition we currently restrict the use of invisalign to adults and teens with mature dentition individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth which typically occurs between the ages of 11 and 15 years we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing as the effectiveness of invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment based on our clinical studies to date we recommend that dental professionals use invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for severe malocclusions approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us these patients represent approximately one percent of the population of people with malocclusion of these we estimate 40 percent or more than 800000 patients have mature dentition and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces persons with malocclusion will be more likely to seek treatment we believe that adults who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment represent our most immediate and significant market expansion opportunity 

in an effort to more fully penetrate our target market in august 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex cases invisalign express is a simple dual arch orthodontic treatment consisting of up to ten aligners we expect invisalign express will increase the overall market for invisalign as patients who would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment due to its relatively high cost are introduced to this lowercost treatment option we continue to market and sell our traditional full invisalign treatment option for more complex cases 

as of december 31 2005 approximately 380000 patients worldwide have started treatment using invisalign internationally we operate in the geographic regions of europe asiapacific japan and latin america in 2005 international sales accounted for 12 of our net revenues 

in each of fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

business strategy 

our objective is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic malocclusion through customer responsiveness product leadership and operational effectiveness key elements of our strategy include the following 

customer responsiveness 

focus on education and customer support   in order to build longterm relationships with our customers we focus on delivering superior training support and services each year we provide numerous clinical education and training programs which include certification classes conference calls seminars and workshops by participating in these events we believe that our customers will emerge with a better 

understanding of the product and its applicability and with a greater awareness for starting and finishing invisalign cases we also maintain an online clinical education center which is intended to augment our training workshops conference calls and seminars by enabling invisaligntrained doctors to obtain continuing education credits and access a full range of case studies and best practices 

educate future orthodontists and general practitioners   by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option currently we have incorporated the invisalign technique into selected orthodontic and dental undergraduate curriculums in 2006 we intend to continue the integration of invisalign into the programs of additional universities and postgraduate institutions

stimulate demand for invisalign treatment   our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually in the second quarter of 2005 we launched a new consumer marketing campaign designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced dental professionals as of december 31 2005 we had trained approximately 35800 dental professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of invisalign

improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps   we have two customer channels the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist or gp although we have historically generated a majority of our revenues from orthodontists there exists a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists as the primary care dental provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and in certain instances may choose to treat less complex cases themselves we are committed to improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps we continue to support study clubs which pair experienced orthodontists with less experienced gps these orthodontists act as mentors to the gps and lend them support and guidance in their invisalign practice through these study clubs gps are introduced to an experienced invisalign practitioner and are able to refer appropriate cases to these orthodontists we believe that improved collaboration is beneficial to the orthodontist and the gp and will accelerate growth in invisalign cases and consequently increase our revenues as specialists orthodontists are a critical part of our business and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications we expect however that that the percentage of revenue generated by gps will increase largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists we believe the expected increase in the number of cases treated by gps will result in an increase in the overall market for invisalign as patients that would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by gps information regarding risks related to our expectation that orthodontists and gps will collaborate may be found in part i item 1a of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors”

product leadership 

new products and enhancements to products   our strategy for ensuring product leadership focuses on delivering new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience in 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex cases allowing the dental professional to treat a broader range of patients currently we are in early testing of a bracket positioning template or bpt the bpt product which is intended to be used in conjunction with our digital treatment plan will if successfully launched allow dental professionals to place traditional brackets on teeth with minimal effort thereby increasing their efficiency and reducing patient chair time new product features and enhancements include the compliance indicator aligner branding and next generation aligner material the compliance indicator will help the dental professional and the patient understand if the patient has worn their aligner for enough time to effectively move their teeth aligner branding is intended to distinguish and grow the invisalign brand differentiating us from our competitors next generation aligner material will more consistently deliver force to the teeth over a longer period of time improving efficacy of treatment we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at the forefront of the market

extend and defend technology leadership   invisalign represents a significant technological advancement in orthodontics our issued us patents broadly cover the invisalign system including digital modeling and manipulation of scanned patient data treatment planning and fabrication of dental appliances among others we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various countries where the invisalign system is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws information regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in part i item 1a of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” see also part i item 3 of this report on form 10k under the heading “legal proceedings”

operational effectiveness 

expand and enhance manufacturing capability   our manufacturing operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom aligners at a high level of quality to improve cost efficiency we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively lowwage countries we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process by continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes we plan to increase the level of production automation increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both production times and unit costs

manufacturing 

we produce highly customized precise medical quality products in volume to do so we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions computed tomography known as ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 

we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 

as of december 31 2005 we employed a manufacturing staff in the us and costa rica of approximately 573 people manufacturing is coordinated in santa clara california digital dental modeling is processed in our 63000 square foot facility in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatments using simulation software in the second quarter of 2005 in an effort to optimize operations improve efficiency and reduce operating costs we announced our intention to relocate our streolithography sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara california facility and outsource this process to a third party shelter services provider based in juarez mexico we expect this relocation to be complete by the second quarter of 2006 we also outsource the fabrication and packaging of aligners to this same third party shelter services provider information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

the invisalign treatment process 

the invisalign treatment process comprises the following five stages 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us   in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches xrays of the patient’s dentition photographs of the patient a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient’s upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form or prescription the impression is a critical component of invisalign as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patient’s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patient’s teeth the prescription is also a critical component of invisalign describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our santa clara facility

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion   upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition using ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional’s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in costa rica

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck  in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon passing review the simulation is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via virtual invisalign practice vip our proprietary customer interfacing software which is available on our websites located at wwwinvisaligncom and wwwaligntechcom  the dental professional then reviews the clincheck simulation and determines whether to ask us to make adjustments by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to review clincheck allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professional then approves the proposed treatment and in doing so engages us for the manufacture of corresponding aligners 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment   we use the approved clincheck simulation to construct a series of molds of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment these molds are currently fabricated at our santa clara california manufacturing facility using stereolithography that we have adapted for use in orthodontic applications as noted above we intend to relocate our sla mold fabrication operations from 

our santa clara california facility and outsource this process to a third party shelter services provider based in juarez mexico we expect this relocation to be complete by the second quarter of 2006 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional   from these molds our third party shelter services provider in juarez mexico fabricates aligners by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold the aligners are then trimmed polished cleaned and packaged following final inspection the aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental professional we ship all of the aligners in a single batch in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with toothcolored attachments bonded to the patient’s teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement in certain cases we provide an alignerlike template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s teeth also in cases where interproximal reduction or ipr is requested by the dental professional we provide an ipr treatment form quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction location and timing of ipr

throughput management 

because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we do not build inventories as a result we must conservatively build manufacturing throughput for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continue to upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez mexico in order to scale our manufacturing capacity we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment including the purchase of additional sla machines during 2006 

quality assurance 

align’s quality system is in compliance with food  drug administration’s medical device regulations 21cfr part 820 and health canada’s medical device regulations we are certified to en iso 134852003 internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing and iso 134851996 recognized standards of the council of canada align has a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

since we custom manufacture aligners on a buildtoorder basis we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck and each aligner is unique we inspect 100 of the product at various points in the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers’ expectations aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed in the event the aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners 

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment 

plan deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth 

sales and marketing 

we market invisalign by communicating invisalign’s benefits directly to dental professionals through our training certification programs and direct mail campaigns and to consumers with a nationwide advertising campaign based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales in our test markets we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign in order to serve anticipated demand we are training a broad base of dental professionals 

professional marketing 

our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july 1999 in 2001 we began marketing invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market we provide training certification marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in the us and canada which we consider our domestic market and internationally 

as of december 31 2005 we had trained approximately 35800 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those trained dental professionals approximately 73 are dental professionals in our domestic market united states and canada within our domestic market we have trained approximately 7900 orthodontists and approximately 18200 active general practitioner dentists 

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of our website 

after training sales representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases such follow up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions establishing an internet connection and familiarizing them with our website sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

consumer marketing 

our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources 

·   an orthodontist

·   a general practice dentist

·   consumer marketing and advertising

·   our website which can be accessed at either wwwinvisaligncom or wwwaligntechcom

·   directtoconsumer mail advertising and public relations efforts and

·   other invisalign patients

in the second quarter of 2005 we launched a new consumer marketing campaign and advertising strategy involving television radio print media and consumer website this marketing program is designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced dental professionals 

research and development 

our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines our research and development expenses were 186 million for fiscal 2005 158 million for fiscal 2004 and 131 million for fiscal 2003 

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities a series of clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process our product development team is testing enhanced materials and a number of complementary products such as the bracket positioning template that when used in conjunction with our digital treatment plan will if successfully launched guide doctors in proper bracket placement in traditional wires and brackets therapy and the compliance indicator which will help doctors and patients understand if the patients have worn their aligners for enough time to effectively move their teeth 

intellectual property 

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2005 we had 62 issued us patents 97 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications see part i item 3 legal proceedings for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business information regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in part i item 1a of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

competition 

we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets which include 3m company sybron dental specialties and dentsply international inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign including the product called red white  blue manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a wholly owned subsidiary of sybron dental specialties see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for a summary of our litigation with ormco and the permanent injunction issued by the court to enjoin ormco from selling the infringing red white  blue in may 2005 orthoclear inc announced the commercial launch of the orthoclear system a product that is intended to compete directly with our invisalign system we believe that orthoclear’s product infringes on our intellectual property including our trade secrets see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” for a 

summary of our litigation with orthoclear in the future we may face further competition from other early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in part i item ia of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors”

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following 

·   aesthetic appeal of the treatment method

·   effectiveness of treatment

·   customer support

·   comfort associated with the treatment method

·   oral hygiene

·   ease of use and

·   dental professionals’ chair time

we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation 

fda’s quality system regulation for medical devices   invisalign has recently been informed by the food and drug administration or fda that our invisalign system has been classified as a class ii medical device correcting what the fda described as a prior classification error the invisalign system was previously regulated as a class i medical device and was exempted from requiring 510k premarket notification prior to commercialization in 1998 however we voluntarily filed with and subsequently received premarket clearance from the fda pursuant to the 510k premarket notification procedure allowing us to market the product in the us therefore we currently possess the necessary 510k clearance from the fda to continue to market our product under the class ii classification prior to this classification correction our product development manufacturing processes packaging labeling handling storage and distribution activities were subject to extensive oversight by the fda we believe our invisalign system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the invisalign system we do not anticipate any significant difficulty or material cost increases in complying with applicable performance standards as a result of the incremental regulatory requirements resulting from the class ii classification

our aligners are manufactured by international manufacturing solutions operaciones srl “ims” a third party shelter services provider based in juarez mexico ims is registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturer and is certified to iso 90012000 requirements we have also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes have been implemented at ims to comply with the fda’s quality systems standards ims has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel in the manufacture and distribution of invisalign we and ims are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer

if the fda determines that we or ims failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 

health canada’s medical device regulations   in canada we are required to comply with health canada’s medical device regulations our products are registered with health canada we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada

european union’s mdd requirements  iso 13485   in europe invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such we follow the requirements of the medical device directives we are iso 13485 certified which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996   under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information although compliance is principally the responsibility of the hospital physician or other healthcare provider we are required to maintain the confidentiality of patient information when providing technical services and when handling patient information and records we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provided services to our customers additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements

other federal and state laws   as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us

laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions under the federal antikickback statute prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers finally various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service for dentists and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions

 item 1a risk factors 

if we fail to sustain our revenue growth while controlling our expenses the market price of our common stock may decline 

you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks expenses and difficulties encountered by a company in an early stage of operations consistent with a company in an early stage of operations we continue to incur significant operating expenses to 

·   develop new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing processes

·   execute our consumer marketing campaign and dental professional marketing efforts

·   execute clinical research and education plans

·   develop technological improvements to our products and new product development

·   continue our international sales and marketing efforts

·   protect our intellectual property including trade secrets and

·   undertake quality assurance and improvement initiatives

for instance in an effort to raise the profile of invisalign and drive prospective patients to our most experienced dental professionals in the second quarter of 2005 we launched a consumer marketing campaign involving television radio and print media marketing programs of this nature are expensive and may have limited success if any and may not result in revenue generation commensurate with its costs 

while we achieved profitability beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we experienced a net loss in the third quarter of 2005 if we are to achieve profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our revenues while controlling our expenses we generated positive operating cash flow for the first time in fiscal year 2003 and continued to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 however we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase such positive cash flow from operations from period to period in the future because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we may not be able to sustain our historical growth rates in future periods if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

we have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock price 

we were incorporated in april 1997 and began sales of invisalign in july 1999 thus we have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects in addition we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing our commercial sales these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

·   the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors such as orthoclear inc

·   aggressive price competition from competitors including orthoclear

·   changes in the timing of product orders

·   unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity any disruptions in the manufacturing process including as a result of unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes

·   inaccurate forecasting of revenues production and other operating costs

·   costs and expenditures in connection with ongoing litigation in particular the litigation related to orthoclear

·   changes in product mix due to the introduction of invisalign express a lowercost alternative for treating less complex cases and

·   investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to invisalign

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy business structure or operations most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues therefore our operating results for a given period may be adversely affected due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

we are currently involved in litigation with several former employees stemming from our efforts to protect our intellectual property this litigation is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

we seek to diligently protect our intellectual property rights on february 2 2005 we filed a complaint against orthoclear inc orthoclear holdings inc mr chishti one of our founders and several former employees among other things the complaint alleges tort contract statutory and common law causes of action arising from orthoclear and the individual defendants’ alleged plan to unlawfully utilize our intellectual property confidential information and employees the complaint also alleges that orthoclear mr chishti and other defendants are in breach of contractual obligations statutory law and common law for attempting to intentionally interfere and disrupt our ongoing business operations and improperly gain access to our customer relationships and trade secrets the complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages in an amount to be determined on july 19 2005 we filed a multiclaim lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of california against orthoclear the complaint alleges numerous violations of the federal lanham act 15 usc §1051 et seq by orthoclear and its officers and employees these violations include unfair competition trademark infringement and false advertising the complaint also alleges violations by orthoclear of california’s unfair practices act california business and professions code §17200 et seq on january 11 2006 we filed a complaint with the international trade commission “itc” against orthoclear seeking to halt the importation into the united states of infringing aligners manufactured by orthoclear in pakistan in violation of our patents and other intellectual property rights the itc complaint requests the itc institute an immediate investigation and ultimately issue an exclusionary order enforced by us customs and border protection excluding orthoclear aligners from importation into the united states the itc complaint also requests the itc issue two cease and desist orders specifically preventing orthoclear from importing infringing aligners and from selling in the united states imported orthoclear aligners the itc has determined to institute a formal investigation in addition on january 11 2006 we filed a federal court patent infringement action in the western district of wisconsin madison this federal action seeks monetary damages and an injunction to augment the exclusionary relief available from the itc 

although each of these lawsuits is in the early stages litigating claims of this type whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

in addition we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however in the ormco litigation there is no assurance that the court’s decision will not be overturned on appeal in addition litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

see part i item 3 of this form 10k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 

currently our invisalign product competes directly against a product called red white and blue which is manufactured and distributed by ormco a subsidiary of sybron dental specialties and an aligner product manufactured by orthoclear inc in addition manufacturers of traditional braces such as 3m company sybron dental specialties and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed in may 2005 orthoclear announced the launch of the orthoclear system a product that is intended to compete directly with our invisalign system although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights and prevent orthoclear from continuing to market any product that infringes on our intellectual property if orthoclear is successful in gaining broad market acceptance of its product our business could be adversely affected see part i item 3 of this report on form 10k for a more complete summary of the orthoclear litigation increased competition from orthoclear and other competitors has recently resulted in and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions reduced gross margins reduced profitability and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue volume growth net profit and stock price for instance in the fourth quarter of 2005 in order to encourage continued use of our products we extended our volume based discount program directed to all of our doctors in addition in the second half of 2005 we introduced invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex cases as well as a new pricing initiative which had the effect of reducing our average selling price per case these programs have adversely affected our revenues gross margin and net profit we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our 

business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems to more effectively manage our operations 

throughout 2006 we intend to add additional functionality into our business enterprise systems which will more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results furthermore we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications specifically clincheck and vip software applications frequently contain errors or defects especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released in addition we currently do not have adequate resiliency in our information technology systems the discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation or increased service costs any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business financial condition or results of operations further in the fourth quarter of 2005 we began transitioning to a new information technology outsourcing provider we terminated this relationship in the first quarter of 2006 and are currently transitioning back to our original information technology outsourcing provider delays in transition and failure to migrate smoothly through this transition could cause business disruptions 

in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec we are required to furnish in our form 10k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 

we depend on the sale of invisalign for the vast majority of our revenues and any decline in sales of invisalign or average selling prices would adversely affect revenue gross margin and net profits 

we expect that revenues from the sale of invisalign will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists gps and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate if orthodontists and gps do not collaborate as we expect or if the average selling price of our product declines our operating results would be harmed factors that could cause invisalign not to achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 

dental professionals may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

our success depends upon increasing acceptance of invisalign by dental professionals invisalign requires orthodontists gps and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways in addition because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july 1997 and commercially available only since july 1999 orthodontists and gps may be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available also increasing adoption and cumulative use by orthodontists and gps will depend on factors such as the capability safety efficacy ease of use price quality and reliability of our products our ability to provide effective sales support training and service and the availability of competing products technologies and alternative treatments in the future unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and consequently reduced acceptance by dental professionals in addition increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals’ efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice if invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and gp communities our operating results will be harmed 

consumers may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

in addition our success depends upon the acceptance of invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental professionals as well as potential consumers to whom we are now actively marketing invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment in addition consumers may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for invisalign which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment we have generally received positive feedback from both orthodontists gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety reliability improved treatment aesthetics greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products furthermore consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience adoption by consumers may also be affected by general macroeconomic conditions in north america and internationally which fluctuate and could be affected by unstable global economic political or other conditions 

the orthodontist and gps may choose not to collaborate and referrals between orthodontists and gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

our success depends in part upon improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gp dentists as specialists orthodontists are a critical part of our business and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive 

research for expanding invisalign applications we expect however that the percentage of revenues generated by gps will increase largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists as the primary provider of dental care gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontist and in certain instances may chose to treat less complex cases themselves if this collaboration and increase in referrals does not occur or occurs more slowly than we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

declines in average selling prices of our products 

in response to challenges in our business including increased competition in the second half of 2005 we reduced the list price of full invisalign cases and introduced invisalign express a lowercost solution for less complex cases in addition in the fourth quarter of 2005 we expanded our volume based discount program to all doctors as a result of these programs the blended average selling price for our products has declined we expect each of these programs and other similar programs that we may introduce in the future to adversely affect our revenue gross margin and net profits 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop obtain regulatory approval or clearance of manufacture and market new products in the second half of 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowcost aligner system to be used for less complex cases we are in early testing of a bracket positioning template and other new products there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product the extent of and rate at which market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables which include among other things price safety efficacy reliability marketing and sales efforts the availability of thirdparty reimbursement of procedures using our new products the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration or fda and foreign government agencies any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 

we are dependent on our international manufacturing operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds a third party shelter services provider in juarez mexico fabricates aligners and ships the completed products to our customers we are currently in the process of relocating our sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara california facility to this same third party provider we expect this relocation to be complete by the second quarter of 2006 as a result of this relocation our reliance on our international manufacturing operations will continue to increase our costs associated with these operations are denominated in costa rican colons mexican pesos and us dollars our increasing reliance on 

international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

·   difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations

·   difficulties in managing international operations including our relationship with ims our third party shelter services provider

·   import and export license requirements and restrictions

·   controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process

·   political social and economic instability

·   acts of terrorism and acts of war

·   interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services

·   product or material transportation delays or disruption

·   burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws

·   trade restrictions and changes in tariffs

·   fluctuations in currency exchange rates and

·   potential adverse tax consequences

if any of these risks materialize in the future we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue in addition to the risks set forth above if we do not successfully coordinate the relocation and consolidation of our sla mold fabrication operations we may be unable to produce sufficient volume of molds to meet customer demand which would harm our results of operations 

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed 

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2005 we had 62 issued us patents 97 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications 

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products during fiscal 2005 requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office “uspto” by a san francisco california law firm acting on behalf of an unnamed party requesting reexamination of a number of our patents the uspto has granted the request to reexamine us patent nos 5975893 6398548 6309215 6705863 6217325 as of the date of this report on form 10k the uspto issued initial office actions with regard to us patent nos 6217325 the ‘325 patent 6309215 the ‘215 patent and 5975893 the ‘893 patent while the pending reexaminations are in a preliminary stage and we are still evaluating all issues we believe that the claims of the patents in reexamination will be determined to be patentable as currently written or as may be amended during the reexamination proceedings however there can be no assurance that we will prevail and the reexamination proceedings could cause some or all of these patent claims to have a narrower scope of coverage or even to be invalidated which would have an adverse affect on us see part i item 3 of this form 10k for a summary of the uspto proceedings in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur see part i item 3 of this form 10k for a summary of the orthoclear litigation 

our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share 

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business will be severely limited 

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future from time to time we have received and may in the 

future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

see part i item 3 of this form 10k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 

we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process and if our access to these inputs is diminished our business may be harmed 

we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process we rely on a third party shelter services provider located in juarez mexico to fabricate aligners and to ship the completed product to customers in addition by the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we expect to complete the relocation of our sla mold fabrication process to the same third party shelter services provider in juarez mexico as a result if this third party fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party shelter services provider with respect to hiring and retaining qualified personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible 

we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends 

we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies in particular we are committed to purchase all of our resin from a singlesource and our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by single suppliers technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of technology changes delivery delays or shortages of these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

we have experienced rapid growth and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business 

we have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in 1999 our headcount increased from approximately 50 employees as of december 31 1999 to approximately 1097 employees as of december 31 2005 this expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the us and internationally in particular rapid growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas including recruiting and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards and preserving our culture and values our inability to effectively manage this level of growth could harm our business 

we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business  

our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our domestic market and internationally as of december 31 2005 our sales organization consisted of 130 people of which 106 were direct sales representatives and 24 were sales administration and management we do not have any longterm employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force the loss of the services of these key personnel may harm our business in the first half of 2005 approximately 17 orthodontic sales representatives representing approximately 50 of our orthodontic sales force left align and joined orthoclear although we have replaced the majority of these individuals with new sales representatives to adequately train and successfully deploy new representatives into effected regions and to reestablish strong customer relationships takes time if we are unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to reestablish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed 

complying with regulations enforced by the food and drug administration fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

·   product design development manufacture and testing

·   product labeling

·   product storage

·   premarket clearance or approval

·   advertising and promotion and

·   product sales and distribution

our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

·   warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties

·   repair replacement refunds recall or seizure of our products

·   operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production

·   refusing our requests for 510k clearance or premarket approval of new products new intended uses or modifications to existing products

·   withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and

·   criminal prosecution

if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections we and our third party shelter services provider have not yet been subject to an fda inspection and we cannot assure you we or our third party shelter services provider will successfully pass such an inspection in the future our failure or the failure of our third party shelter services provider to take satisfactory 

corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process 

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

·   storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records

·   prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order purchase or recommendation of our products and

·   the marketing and advertising of our products

complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

we currently sell our products in europe canada the united kingdom mexico brazil australia and hong kong and may expand into other countries from time to time recently we announced our intention to launch sales of invisalign in japan we do not know whether orthodontists gps and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate in addition sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 the market price for our common stock was volatile 

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

·   quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity

·   changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results

·   speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations

·   strategic actions by our competitors such as product announcements or acquisitions

·   announcements of technological innovations or new products by us our customers or competitors and

·   general market conditions

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future we would incur substantial legal fees and our management’s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations such as expensing of stock options could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

·   revenue recognition

·   accounting for sharebased payments and

·   accounting for income taxes

in particular the fasb recently enacted sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which we will adopt effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 as a result we expect that sfas 123r will have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results and may impact the way in which we conduct our business which may affect our stock price 

we have made use of a shareholders rights’ plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 

our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights preferences privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders to date our board of directors has designated 200000 shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights’ plan the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock the shareholder rights’ plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors the shareholder rights’ plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights’ plan

during fiscal 2005 requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office “uspto” by a san francisco california law firm acting on behalf of an unnamed party requesting reexamination of six of our patents us patent nos 5975893 6398548 6309215 6705863 6217325 and 6722880 the uspto has granted the request to reexamine five of the six patents specifically patent no 5975893 patent no 6398548 patent no 6309215 patent no 6705863 and patent no 6217325 as of the date of this report on form 10k the uspto issued initial office actions with regard to us patent nos 6217325 the ‘325 patent 6309215 the ‘215 patent and 5975893 the ‘893 patent in these initial office actions the examiners confirmed the validity of three of the twentysix claims of the ‘325 patent and five of the eleven claims of the ‘215 patent without amendment and preliminarily rejected the remaining claims of the patents in addition the examiners preliminarily rejected all the claims in the ‘893 patent these nonfinal initial office actions present align with its first opportunity to respond to the uspto’s review and interpretation of the prior art we may and intend to submit amendments affidavits or declarations or other documents as evidence of patentability in response to its actions on the ‘325 ‘215 and ‘893 patents the reexamination proceedings on patent nos 6398548 6705863 collectively the “remaining patents” are currently pending but no office action has been received by us while the pending reexaminations are in a preliminary stage we believe that claims of the patents in reexamination will be determined to be patentable as currently written or as may be amended during the reexamination proceeding however there can be no assurance that we will prevail and reexamination proceedings could result in some or all of the remaining patent claims as well as the ‘215 ‘325 and ‘893 patent claims having a narrower scope of coverage or even to being invalidated which could have an adverse effect on us on december 23 2005 in a nonappealable final order the uspto denied the request for reexamination with respect to all twentyone claims of our us patent no 6722880 the ‘880 patent accordingly the validity of all twentyone claims of our ‘880 patent stand reaffirmed by the 

uspto on january 23 2006 a petition seeking review of denial of request for reexamination of the ‘880 patent was filed by the same san francisco california law firm as of the date of this report on form 10k we have not received a response from the uspto 

on july 25 2005 bay materials llc “bay” filed suit against us in the superior court of the state of california for the county of san mateo the complaint as amended asserts among other things breach of contract promissory estoppel fraud and negligent misrepresentation by us bay alleges that we breached the terms of a purchase order by failing to pay for unshipped goods manufactured by bay pursuant to such order bay further alleges that we promised to purchase from bay an alternative polyurethane product and bay relied on this representation to develop such an alternative product which we determined not to use the complaint seeks monetary damages of 11 million related to breach of contract and research and development costs incurred plus unspecified damages related to lost profit punitive and exemplary damages and legal expenses we intend to vigorously defend ourselves 

litigating claims of these types whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

there were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 

part ii 




 item 5   market for registrant’s common equity and related stockholder matters

a price range of common stock 

our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market under the symbol “algn” public trading of our common stock commenced on january 26 2001 prior to that date there was no public market for our common stock the following table shows for the periods indicated the high and low per share closing prices of our common stock as reported by the nasdaq national market 

 

  

on february 24 2006 the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market was 838 per share as of february 24 2006 there were approximately 277 holders of record of our common stock because the majority of our shares of outstanding common stock is held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders 

we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future in addition in december 2005 we renegotiated our existing revolving line of credit the new credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants including our ability to pay dividends see part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” 




 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

align technology founded in april 1997 designs manufactures and markets invisalign a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition we received fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998 and we began commercial operations in july 1999 

the invisalign system is manufactured in phases the initial step in our manufacturing process is the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck an internally developed computermodeling program these treatment plans are developed at our operations facility in costa rica and are made available to the prescribing dental professional via our proprietary customer interfacing software vip the prescribing orthodontist or general practitioner dentist gp then reviews the clincheck simulation clincheck allows the orthodontist or gp to simulate treatment in three dimensions by modeling twoweek stages of tooth movement upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck simulation we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography sla technology to manufacture aligner molds a third party shelter services provider located in juarez mexico uses these molds to fabricate aligners aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by a dental professional using clincheck after the aligners are produced our third party shelter services provider ships the finished products to our customers 

we generate the vast majority of our revenues from the sales of the invisalign system to orthodontists and gps in the united states and canada our domestic market for the year ended december 31 2005 sales of invisalign in our domestic gp channel and our domestic orthodontist channel represented approximately 43 and 41 of our total revenues respectively 

a number of factors the most important of which are set forth below may affect our success during 2006 and beyond 

·   increased pricing pressure in may 2005 orthoclear inc announced the commercial launch of the orthoclear system a product that is intended to compete directly with our invisalign system we believe that orthoclear’s product infringes on our intellectual property and we have filed several lawsuits alleging among other things orthoclear’s unlawful use of our intellectual property including our trade secrets see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report on form 10k for a more complete summary of the orthoclear litigation in response to orthoclear’s launch and in an effort to simplify our pricing structure in the fourth quarter of 2005 we announced that all invisalign cases other than invisalign express in our domestic market will have a list price of 1495 per case previously list prices ranged from 1195 to 1895 per case depending on the treatment option selected in addition in the fourth quarter of 2005 we expanded our volume based discount program to all doctors we expect each of these programs and other similar programs that we may launch in 2006 to adversely affect our revenue gross margin and net profits

·   disruption in sales coverage and customer relationships in the first half of 2005 17 orthodontic sales representatives representing approximately 50 of our orthodontic sales force left align and joined orthoclear we have replaced the majority of these individuals with new sales representatives case submissions in our orthodontic channel were slightly lower in the last two quarters of 2005 compared to the previous two quarters due in part to the disruption in our sales force and the resulting disruption to many of our key customer relationships we are committed to train and successfully deploy our new sales team and rebuild these disrupted customer relationships see “part i item 1a—risk factors—we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business” 

·   penetration into our domestic market   although we have historically generated a majority of our revenues from orthodontists there exists a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists as the primary provider of dental care gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients on the benefits of oral care and introduce them to invisalign gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and may choose to treat less complex cases themselves largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists we expect that an increasingly larger percentage of our revenues will be generated by gps in fact in fiscal 2005 our domestic gp channel generated 43 of our total revenue while the orthodontist channel represented 41 we believe that by focusing on increasing utilization rates among our existing gp customers the overall market for invisalign will increase as patients who would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by their gps in addition by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option in 2005 four dental schools harvard university columbia university temple university and the university of texas at san antonio announced the integration of the invisalign technique into their curriculums we expect additional dental schools to integrate the invisalign technique into their curriculums in the future

·   continued product leadership    we are committed to investing in delivering new products enhancing the user experience and introducing new product features to our existing products in the second half of 2005 we launched invisalign express a lowercost aligner system to be used for less complex cases invisalign express is intended to assist our customers to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lower cost option for less complex orthodontic cases thereby increasing the market for our products in addition we are currently in the early testing of a bracket positioning template which if successfully launched is intended to be used in conjunction with our digital treatment plan in order to guide doctors in proper bracket placement in traditional wires and bracket treatment we are also planning to introduce a compliance indicator which will help doctors and patients understand if the patients have worn their aligners for enough time to effectively move their teeth by investing in developing these new products and continually enhancing our existing products we expect to increase market share

·   expansion of international markets we will focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in key international markets including europe and japan we will consider expanding into additional international markets on a case by case basis in october 2005 we announced the launch of invisalign in japan in fiscal 2005 our international channel represented approximately 12 of our total revenue

·   increasing reliance on international manufacturing operations our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability we use a third party based in juarez mexico international manufacturing solutions operaciones srl “ims” for the fabrication and packaging of aligners we are currently in the process of relocating our sla mold 

fabrication operations from our santa clara california facility to ims we expect this relocation to be complete by the second quarter of 2006 as a result of this relocation our reliance on our international manufacturing operations will continue to increase our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of management to effectively manage this international operation including our relationship with ims in addition we currently are and will become increasingly dependant on ims’s ability to hire and retain employees generally as well as hire and retain employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations if our management andor ims fail in any of these respects we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue in addition even if we have case submissions in the manufacturing backlog if ims is unable for any of these or other reasons to timely ship our product to our customers our revenue will be delayed which will cause our operating results to fluctuate see part i item 1a—risk factors for risks related to our international operations  

results of operations 

comparison of years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

revenues 

invisalign product revenues by channel and other revenue which represented training and sales of ancillary products for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 are as follows 

 

  

revenue grew by 20 for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the growth in revenues resulted primarily from an increase in overall case shipment volume in the domestic gp channel driven by an increase in the number of participating clinicians and the launch of invisalign express in the third quarter of 2005 additionally international sales improved primarily as a result of increased number of participating clinicians and case utilization by our european practitioners 

for the year ended december 31 2004 growth in revenues from our domestic orthodontic and general practitioner channels over fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from higher case volumes driven by an increase in the number of participating clinicians and utilization within the general practitioner practices higher product sales during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 also benefited from increased promotional advertising campaigns and sales initiatives in effect during fiscal 2004 

for the fiscal year 2006 although we expect our case shipment volume to increase we anticipate that our revenues will remain consistent with fiscal year 2005 in 2006 we will begin to see the full impact of the lower average selling price resulting from both the pricing initiatives we introduced during the fourth quarter of 2005 and invisalign express which we launched in the third quarter of 2005 and has a lower average selling price than our full invisalign product 

cost of revenues 

 

  

cost of revenues includes the salaries for staff involved in the production process the cost of materials packaging shipping costs depreciation on the capital equipment used in the production process training costs and the cost of facilities 

gross margin improved to 69 of revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 compared to 67 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 this improvement in gross margin is primarily the result of cost savings achieved from manufacturing process improvements and increased cost absorption due to higher production volumes partially offset by increased training costs as a result of dental professionals auditing training classes for no charge 

gross margin for the year ended december 31 2004 improved to 67 of revenues compared to 58 of revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 the higher gross margin for the year ended december 31 2004 was primarily attributable to improved fixed cost absorption related to increasing volumes manufacturing process improvements in both our treatment operations facility in costa rica and in the aligner fabrication process also included in cost of revenues are stockbased compensation expenses of 09 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

for the fiscal year 2006 we anticipate that our gross margin including stock based compensation will decrease slightly primarily as we begin to see the full impact of the lower average selling price discussed in revenues above 

sales and marketing 

 

  

sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation combined with travel related costs and expenses for professional marketing programs expenses relating to conducting workshops and market surveys advertising and dental professional trade show attendance 

sales and marketing expense increased by 242 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was primarily related to incremental headcount which resulted in higher payroll costs of 103 million 67 million related to increased advertising media and trade show costs an additional 48 million on outside services and other sales and marketing support costs and 24 million of expenses attributable to retention incentives and guarantees paid to our sales force in response to the solicitation of our sales force by orthoclear during the first quarter of 2005 

the increase in sales and marketing expense during fiscal 2005 was consistent with our marketing and sales initiatives we expect 2006 sales and marketing expense including stock based compensation to be comparable to 2005 as we continue to develop and expand our domestic and international markets develop new media programs enhance our web site and provide clinical education sales and marketing 

expense increased by 122 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 this increase resulted primarily from an increase in spending of 44 million related to incremental headcount in our north american sales and marketing work force 09 million related to north america sales force training 27 million related to our international workforce and outside services and 59 million related to increases in media advertising costs marketing promotions and other related expenses the increase in spending was partially offset by the decrease of 15 million in stockbased compensation expense sales and marketing expense includes stockbased compensation expenses of 07 million and 22 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

general and administrative 

 

  

general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel outside consulting services legal expenses and general corporate expenses 

general and administrative expense increased by 83 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 during 2005 we incurred 80 million of incremental expense related to the orthoclear litigation which resulted from higher external legal and consulting costs and the hiring of additional legal staff 

compared to year ended december 31 2003 general and administrative expenses decreased by 04 million for the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to the decrease in stockbased compensation expense of 44 million and legal fees of 24 million the decrease in litigation spending was primarily due to the settlement charge of 21 million included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 related to the conclusion of the discus arbitration proceedings the decreased expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 were offset by increases of 42 million in payroll expenses and 21 million in general corporate expenses 

for the fiscal year 2006 we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase from fiscal 2005 this increase will be primarily attributable to stock based compensation and orthoclear related expenses 

general and administrative expenses include stockbased compensation expenses of 01 million 27 million and 71 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

research and development 

 

  

research and development expense includes the costs associated with software engineering the cost of designing developing and testing our products and conducting clinical and postmarketing trials we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 

research and development expense increased by 28 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the primary reasons for the higher expenses in 2005 compared to 2004 were an increase of 13 million in outside services and consulting expenses 11 million of additional payroll related costs due to higher headcount and a 04 million increase in training and other research and development expenses 

the 27 million increase in research and development expense for the year ended december 31 2004 over the year ended december 31 2003 resulted from increased spending of 32 million for product improvement initiatives and a 11 million severance charge related to the departure of our vice president engineering partially offset by a 16 million decrease in stockbased compensation expense research and development expenses included 16 million and 32 million of stockbased compensation for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

for fiscal 2006 we expect a slight increase in research and development spending including stock based compensation over 2005 as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to bring new products to market conduct clinical research and focus on product improvement initiatives 

interest and other income expense net 

 

  

interest and other income expense net includes interest income earned on cash balances interest expense on debt foreign currency translation gains and losses for the dollar against other currencies related to international businesses and other miscellaneous charges 

interest and other income and expenses for the year ended december 31 2005 included interest income of 19 million which resulted from higher interest rates and average cash balances during 2005 offset by exchange losses of 10 million and 06 million of interest expense bank charges and other expense for year ended december 31 2004 interest and other income and expense included interest income of 07 million exchange gains of 03 million offset by interest expense of 03 million and 07 of other expense and bank charges for the year ended december 31 2003 interest income was 05 million exchange gains were 04 million which were reduced by interest expense of 04 million and other expenses of 04 million 

income tax provision 

 

  

our effective tax rate was 482 102 and 04 for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively as of december 31 2005 we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing deferred tax assets due to uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize these assets before they expire as a result our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 

at december 31 2005 we had a net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 1935 million for federal purposes and 669 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized these carryforwards will begin to expire beginning in 2017 for federal purposes and 2007 for california purposes the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation’s tax attributes if a corporation 

undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes if an ownership change is determined to have occurred our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation however based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december 31 2005 and our current estimate of the annual limitation had a change of ownership occurred we do not expect current utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards to result in a limitation prior to utilization at december 31 2005 we had research credit carryforwards of approximately 39 million for federal purposes and 46 million for california state tax purposes if not utilized the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 

we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from nonus operations as of december 31 2005 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 

stockbased compensation 

 

  

in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and nonemployees prior to 2001 we recorded deferred stockbased compensation as a component of stockholders’ equity stock based compensation was fully amortized as of december 31 2004 for options granted to nonemployees we measure the option’s fair value using the blackscholes valuation model at each reporting period and recognize stock based compensation as options vest which is generally four years this stockbased compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options 

historically we have accelerated the vesting of options to several employees in connection with severance packages these accelerations were accounted for as a charge to the consolidated statements of operations this charge is equal to the intrinsic value of the options which was calculated as a difference between the exercise price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of the acceleration 

for the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded 01 million resulting from accelerated vesting of options in connection with severance packages 

for the year ended december 31 2004 deferred stockbased compensation expenses included 51 million of amortization of deferred compensation expenses 04 million of expense relating to options granted to nonemployees and 04 million of expenses resulting from accelerated vesting of options in connection with severance packages 

for fiscal the year ended december 31 2003 we recorded 128 million of amortization of deferred compensation expense 13 million of expenses relating to options granted to nonemployees and 09 million of expenses resulting from accelerated vesting of options in connection with severance packages 

option acceleration 

on october 6 2005 the compensation committee of our board of directors approved acceleration of the vesting for all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than 710 options held by nonemployee directors are excluded from the vesting acceleration as a result of the acceleration approximately 38 million options or 35 of the total outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of october 6 2005 of the aggregate number of options subject to the acceleration approximately 12 million options or 32 of the total accelerated options were held by our executive officers because the exercise price of all options subject to acceleration was greater than the fair market value of our underlying 

common stock on the date of acceleration we did not record any compensation expense in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

the primary purpose of the acceleration was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of fas 123r fas 123r is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2006 and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of operations rather than as a footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial statements 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs—an amendment of arb no 43” “sfas 151” which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards sfas no 151 requires idle facility expenses freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities sfas no 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which requires the measurement of all employee sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income in march 2005 the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sharebased payment” “sab no 107” relating to the adoption of sfas 123r beginning in the first quarter of 2006 align will adopt sfas 123r under the modified prospective transition method using the blackscholes pricing model under the new standard our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility employee exercise patterns expected life of the options future forfeitures and related tax effects during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we will begin recording the fair value of our sharebased compensation in our financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment revised 2004” although the adoption of sfas 123r will have no adverse impact to our balance sheet and cash flows it will adversely affect our net profit loss and earnings loss per share see notes 1 and 7 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in october 2005 the fasb issued financial statement of position “fsp” fas 123r2 “practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fas 123r” “fsp 123r2” fsp 123r2 provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined in sfas no123r in accordance with this standard a grant date of an award exists if a the award is unilateral grant and b the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval we will adopt this standard when we adopt fas 123r beginning in the first quarter of 2006 and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 123r3 “transition election related to accounting for tax effects of sharebased payment awards” “fsp 123r3” fsp 123r3 provides an elective alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the beginning balance of the accumulated paidin capital pool related to employee compensation and simplified method to determine the subsequent impact the accumulated paidin capital pool employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas no 123r we are currently evaluating this transition method 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” “sfas no 154 sfas no 154 is a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 20 and sfas no 3 sfas no 154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle sfas no 154 provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable sfas no 154 also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements sfas no 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp fas 1151 and fas 1241 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” “fsp 1151 and 1241” which clarifies when an investment is considered impaired whether the impairment is otherthantemporary and the measurement of an impairment loss it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of the otherthantemporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments fsp 1151 and 1241 are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december 15 2005 at december 31 2005 we have no unrealized investment losses that had not been recognized as otherthantemporary impairments in our availableforsale securities we do not anticipate that the implementation of these statements will have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our operations from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock and from cash generated from sales of our product our cash and cash equivalents balance improved for the year ended december 31 2005 to 742 million from 697 million for the year ended december 31 2004 restricted cash was 02 million and 03 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively we had an accumulated deficit of 2904 million as of december 31 2005 

we generated cash of 161 million and 246 million from our operating activities during the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 resulted primarily from operating profits adjusted for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities partially offset by reductions in accounts payable for the year ended december 31 2004 net cash was provided by operating activities primarily from operating profits adjusted for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 

we used 153 million of cash for our investing activities for the year ended december 31 2005 this included 138 million of cash used to purchase capital assets and 09 million of net cash used to purchase general orthodontics llc for the year ended december 31 2004 we used 60 million of our cash in investing activities primarily to purchase property and equipment for capacity expansion and manufacturing improvements including approximately 32 million for the implementation of the new version of our enterprise resource planning system and new software for our manufacturing execution system partially offsetting these purchases were proceeds from the sale of equipment and maturities of marketable securities during fiscal 2004 

net cash provided by financing activities was 37 million and 61 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively for the year ended december 31 2005 and 2004 net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options partially offset by payments on debt obligations related to the equipmentbased term loan and capital lease obligations 

in december 2002 we obtained a 50 million equipmentbased term loan under our revolving line of credit this loan accrued interest at a rate of 225 above prime during fiscal year 2005 we paid down the outstanding balance of 17 million with interest drawn under this facility 

in december 2005 we renegotiated and amended our existing revolving line of credit the amended credit agreement increases the available borrowings under the revolving line of credit from 15 million to 20 million included in the new revolving line of credit is a letter of credit facility of up to 5 million a foreign exchange facility of up to 5 million and an equipment facility of up to 10 million we may elect interest rates on our borrowing calculated by reference to bank’s prime rate less onehalf of one percent or libor plus two percent the new credit facility matures on december 16 2007 at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid the new credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants including among others financial covenants requiring a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net worth and covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets make acquisitions be acquired incur indebtedness grant liens make investments pay dividends and repurchase stock as of december 31 2005 there was no outstanding borrowing under these credit facilities 

contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements 

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands 

 

1   includes an early termination fee of approximately 220000 on our facility in amsterdam the netherlands the lease expires in 2014 with an option to cancel in 2009

2   equipment for manufacturing operations in mexico

we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations promulgated under the securities act 

as discussed under “part i item 3—legal proceedings” we are currently involved in litigation with various parties each of these proceedings is in its early stages and it is not yet possible to determine its ultimate outcome at this time we cannot estimate the impact this litigation may have on our future cash requirements 

we expect that our expense levels for 2006 including stock based compensation will increase from 2005 depending on our level of business activity we expect that any increases will be focused on continuing efforts to automate our manufacturing processes capacity expansion requirements the size of our sales force and dental professional training staff continued international sales and marketing efforts legal expenses including 100 million to 120 million related to orthoclear litigation and research and 

development expenses as we develop new products and improvements to our existing product in addition we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market sell and support our products on a worldwide basis 

our 2005 incentive plan allows for the issuance of restricted stock units “rsus” among other things we have recently granted rsus together with stock options to certain of our employees rsus do not generate cash as a result by granting rsus we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we could be required to delay implementing our business strategy and reduce our expenditures in general accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition legal contingencies and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we enter into arrangements to sell products services and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products revenue from product sales net of discounts and rebates is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured service revenues are recorded when completed other multiple element arrangements require delivery of products in the future we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element revenue is deferred on the undelivered element based on a historical usage rate and recognized when delivery occurs the amount of revenue deferred is affected by the historical breakage factor and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome requiring future adjustments to revenue 

product warranty 

we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship until the invisalign case is completed we accrue for estimated warranty in costs of goods sold upon the shipment of products the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs actual warranty costs could differ from the 

estimated amounts we regularly review the accrued balances and update these balances based on historical warranty cost trends actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued if we were to experience higher rates of warranty events we would be required to accrue additional warranty costs which would negatively affect our operating results 

legal contingencies 

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note 4 to the notes to consolidated financial statements because of uncertainties related to both the potential amount and range of loss from pending litigation management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an unfavorable outcome in these legal proceedings as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to this pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly revisions of our estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 

deferred tax valuation allowance 

we have established a full valuation allowance because we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is not likely deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which we show on our balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization is not likely we establish a valuation allowance see note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements 

while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance we would decrease the valuation allowance to take into account deferred tax assets that we could realize a decrease in the valuation allowance could have a favorable impact which could be material on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the decrease 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

interest rate risk 

changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable equity securities periodically we invest our excess cash in low risk and shortterm available for sale marketable equity securities these investments are primarily at fixed interest rates as of december 31 2005 we had no outstanding investments in available for sale marketable equity securities due to the short duration of our cash equivalents and investments in marketable equity securities an immediate decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio conversely a hypothetical decline in interest rates of 100 basis points could have an adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows of approximately 700 thousand as a result of lower interest income 

we do not have interest bearing liabilities on our books as of december 31 2005 and are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases an increase in interest rates may affect our future cost of financing in the past we had used fixed rate longterm financing to minimize our risk on interest rates increases 

currency rate risk 

the functional currency of align and its subsidiaries is the us dollar and accordingly gains and losses resulting from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in euro costa rican colon and other currencies are reflected in the determination of net income or loss we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange translation gains and losses included in interest and other expenses for the year ended december 31 2005 was an exchange loss of 10 million for years 2004 and 2003 we experienced exchange gains of 03 million and 04 million respectively primarily related to euro denominated balances an aggregate decline of 10 in foreign currency exchange rates relative to usd may have an adverse effect of approximately 20 million on our results of operations and financial position

our company 

  

align technology inc was incorporated in april 1997 under the laws of the state of delaware we design manufacture and market invisalign a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition align technology received fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998

industry background 

  

malocclusion 

  

malocclusion the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting over 200 million individuals or approximately 75 of the us population approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us generating industry revenues of approximately 7 billion while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional treatment 

  

index to financial statements traditional orthodontic treatment 

  

currently dental professionals apply traditional techniques and principles of orthodontic treatment developed in the early 20th century in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patient’s teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices 

  

the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient’s teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement because of the length of time between visits the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient’s teeth 

  

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us 3500 to 7000 with a median fee of approximately 4800 generally only a portion of the fees are reimbursed by insurance if covered at all in addition dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional’s estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time or reduced profitability for the dental professional 

  

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment 

  

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

  

   

   

   

   

   

index to financial statements    

   

due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability 

  

the align solution 

  

invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion the invisalign treatment process is comprised of several phases the principal steps of which are the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck ™ and the manufacturing of aligners the complete invisalign treatment process is described in greater detail under “business—the invisalign treatment process” 

  

clincheck ™  clincheck ™ is an internally developed computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatment for their patients we use a dental impression and a treatment prescription submitted by a dental professional to develop a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments clincheck ™ allows the dental professional to view this threedimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly clincheck ™ enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible 

  

upon review of the clincheck ™ simulation the dental professional may immediately approve the projected treatment or may provide us with feedback for modification we reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck ™ simulation we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to manufacture aligner molds a third party manufacturer in mexico uses these molds to fabricate the patient’s aligners 

  

aligners  aligners are custommanufactured thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck ™ simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck ™  each aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck ™ treatment simulation after two weeks of use the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use an invisalign retainer or go directly to a conventional retainer 

  

benefits of invisalign 

  

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces 

  

benefits to the dental professional 

  

   

index to financial statements    

   

   

   

benefits to the patient 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

limitations of invisalign 

  

in some instances invisalign may have certain limitations relative to conventional treatment aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in conventional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional the cost of invisalign to the patient may be greater than for conventional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there is generally a turnaround time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal results in addition 

  

index to financial statements because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech in some instances patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have occurred we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 

  

our target market and patient base 

  

medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness class i or ii devices require the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification to the food and drug administration or the fda requesting permission for commercial distribution which is known as 510k clearance we obtained our 510k clearance in september 1998 our 510k clearance allows us to market invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion with mature dentition individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth which typically occurs between the ages of 11 and 15 years we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing as the effectiveness of invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment based on our clinical studies to date we recommend that dental professionals use invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for severe malocclusions 

  

as noted above approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us these patients represent approximately one percent of the population of people with malocclusion of these we estimate 40 percent or more than 800000 patients have mature dentition and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign 

  

our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces persons with malocclusion will be more likely to seek treatment we believe that adults who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment represent our most immediate and significant market expansion opportunity 

  

commercial sales of invisalign commenced in the us in july 1999 as of december 31 2004 approximately 250000 patients worldwide are either currently in or have completed treatment using invisalign internationally we operate through three business units divided among the geographic regions of europe asiapacific and latin america in 2004 international sales accounted for 99 of our net revenues 

  

in each of fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

  

business strategy 

  

our objective is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic malocclusion key elements of our strategy include the following 

  

focus on education and customer support in order to build longterm relationships with our customers we focus on delivering superior training support and services each year we provide numerous clinical education and training programs which include certification classes conference calls seminars and workshops by participating in these events we believe that our customers will emerge with a better understanding of the product and its applicability and with a greater awareness for starting and finishing invisalign cases we also maintain an online clinical education center which is intended to augment our training workshops conference calls and seminars by enabling invisaligntrained doctors to obtain continuing education credits and access a full range of case studies and best practices 

  

index to financial statements educate future orthodontists and general practitioners by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option currently we have incorporated the invisalign technique into selected orthodontic and dental undergraduate curriculums in 2005 we intend to continue the integration of invisalign into the programs of additional universities and postgraduate institutions 

  

stimulate demand for invisalign treatment  our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually we advertise nationally using a broad marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of applicability of invisalign in october 2001 we expanded our training of dental professionals in our domestic market to include general practitioner dentists as of december 31 2004 we had trained approximately 29700 dental professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of invisalign 

  

improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps we have two customer channels the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist or gp we have historically generated a majority of our revenues from orthodontists there exists however a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists as the primary care dental provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and in certain instances may choose to treat less complex cases themselves we are committed to improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps we believe that improved collaboration is beneficial to the orthodontist and the gp and will accelerate growth in invisalign cases and consequently increase our revenues in addition although we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications we expect that the percentage of revenue generated by gps will increase largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists in 2005 we expect that gps will generate a majority of our revenue we believe this expected increase in the number of cases treated by gps will result in an increase in the overall market for invisalign as patients that would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by gps information regarding risks related to our expectation that orthodontists and gps will collaborate may be found in part ii item 7 of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

  

expand and enhance manufacturing capability  our manufacturing operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom aligners at a high level of quality to improve cost efficiency we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively lowwage countries we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process by continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes we plan to increase the level of production automation increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both unit costs and production times 

  

extend and defend technology leadership  invisalign represents a significant technological advancement in orthodontics our issued us patents broadly cover the invisalign ® system including digital modeling and manipulation of scanned patient data treatment planning and fabrication of dental appliances among others we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws information regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in part ii item 7 of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

  

index to financial statements expand utilization within clinician practices invisalign can be used to provide complete treatment for patients with mature dentition over a broad range of malocclusions in addition we believe that invisalign can be incorporated into many treatment plans for severe malocclusion including severe crowding treated either with or without extraction and treatment requiring orthognathic surgery we initiated new studies in fiscal 2004 with universities worldwide to further explore these treatments as we continue to make additional improvements to our product 

  

manufacturing 

  

we produce highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume to do so we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions computed tomography known as ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 

  

we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 

  

as of december 31 2004 we employed a manufacturing staff in the us and costa rica of approximately 539 people manufacturing is coordinated in santa clara california digital dental modeling is processed in our 63000 square foot facility in san jose costa rica the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck ™ treatments using simulation software we outsource the fabrication and packaging of aligners to a contract manufacturer based in juarez mexico information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in part ii item 7 of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

  

the invisalign treatment process 

  

the invisalign treatment process comprises the following five stages 

  

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches xrays of the patient’s dentition photographs of the patient a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient’s upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form or prescription the impression is a critical component of invisalign as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patient’s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patient’s teeth the prescription is also a critical component of invisalign describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our santa clara facility 

  

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition using ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional’s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in costa rica 

  

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck ™  in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon passing review the simulation is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via clincheck ™  which is available on our websites located at wwwinvisaligncom and wwwaligntechcom  the dental professional then reviews the clincheck ™ simulation 

  

index to financial statements and determines whether to ask us to make adjustments by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to review clincheck ™  allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professional then approves the proposed treatment and in doing so engages us for the manufacture of corresponding aligners 

  

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment  we use the approved clincheck ™ simulation to construct a series of molds of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment these molds are fabricated at our santa clara california manufacturing facility using stereolithography that we have adapted for use in orthodontic applications 

  

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional  from these molds our contract manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold the aligners are then trimmed polished cleaned and packaged following final inspection the aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental professional we ship all of the aligners in a single batch in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with clear attachments bonded to the patient’s teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement in certain cases we provide an alignerlike template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s teeth also in cases where interproximal reduction or ipr is requested by the dental professional we provide an ipr prescription form quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction location and timing of ipr 

  

throughput management 

  

because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we do not build inventories as a result we must conservatively build manufacturing throughput for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

  

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continue to upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication of aligners conducted in mexico in order to scale our manufacturing capacity we continue to invest in facilities and capital equipment 

  

quality assurance 

  

align’s quality system is in compliance with the food  drug administration’s medical device regulations 21cfr part 820 and health canada’s medical device regulations we are certified to en iso 134852003 internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing and iso 134851996 recognized standards of the council of canada align has a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined understood and achieved systems processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as needed 

  

since we custom manufacture aligners on a buildtoorder basis we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck ™ and each aligner is unique we inspect 100 of the product at various points in the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers’ expectations aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed in the event the aligners fall within the 

  

index to financial statements scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners 

  

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck ™ treatment plan deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient’s dentition to us we use the impressions to create a new clincheck ™ treatment plan for the dental professional to approve from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 

  

in the event that a dental professional wishes to effect additional adjustments to a patient’s treatment when the actual treatment results are in accordance with the approved clincheck ™ treatment plan the dental professional may request a case refinement or additional aligners our pricing policy includes the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and offers additional case refinements at the dental professional’s expense in addition should a dental professional request a replacement for a lost aligner we charge the dental professional for the cost of the replacement aligner

we market invisalign by communicating invisalign’s benefits directly to dental professionals through our training and certification programs and by direct mail campaigns and to consumers with a nationwide advertising campaign based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales in our test markets we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign in order to serve anticipated demand we are training a broad base of dental professionals 

  

professional marketing 

  

our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july 1999 in 2001 we began marketing invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market we provide training certification marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in the us and canada which we consider our domestic market and internationally 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had trained approximately 29700 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those dental professionals trained approximately 70 are dental professionals in our domestic market united states and canada within our domestic market we have trained approximately 7700 orthodontists and approximately 13800 general practitioner dentists our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign prescription form clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck ™ software and the many other features of our website 

  

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment and we present our training material in a manner consistent with dental professionals’ training and experience our success in training a large number of dental professionals confirms our belief that training represents a minimal barrier to adoption for most dental professionals 

  

after training sales representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases such follow up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions establishing an internet connection and familiarizing them with our website sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to 

  

index to financial statements prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

  

there are over 131000 active general practice dentists in the us and canada as the primary care dental provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and in certain instances may choose to treat less complex cases themselves we are committed to improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps 

  

consumer marketing 

  

our national consumer marketing efforts primarily focus on television advertising and are supported by other advertising media and public relations we advertise nationally using a broad marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand 

  

our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our marketing efforts have generated substantial consumer interest directed toward our telephone support line and our website our telephone support line and our website not only provide consumers with information on invisalign but also allow us to channel consumer interest to dental professionals we have outsourced the telephone support function to a national call center operator 

  

research and development 

  

prior to commercial launch in july 1999 our research and development strategy had three primary objectives developing the invisalign product establishing the ability of invisalign to treat malocclusion and developing software and processes to enable the manufacturing of aligners in volume since our commercial launch our research and development effort has focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines our research and development expenses were 158 million for fiscal 2004 and 131 million for each of fiscal 2003 and 2002 

  

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities a series of clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process our product development team is testing enhanced materials and a number of complementary products that we expect will provide additional revenue opportunities 

  

intellectual property 

  

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2004 we had 56 issued us patents 82 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications 

  

index to financial statements we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products information regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in part ii item 7 of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

  

competition 

  

we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets which include 3m company sybron dental specialties and dentsply international inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign including the product called red white  blue manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics a wholly owned subsidiary of sybron dental specialties in the future we may face competition from early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in part ii item 7 of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

  

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

  

government regulation 

  

fda’s quality system regulation for medical devices the invisalign aligners are regulated as a class i medical device by the food and drug administration “fda” accordingly our product development manufacturing processes packaging labeling handling storage and distribution activities are subject to extensive regulations enforced by both state and federal regulatory authorities 

  

the aligners are manufactured by the tecma group llc a contract manufacturer based in mexico as a medical device company we are required to ensure that our contract manufacturer complies with the fda’s quality system regulations as a result we have ensured that tecma is registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturer and its manufacturing processes comply with regulatory requirements in addition tecma is certified to iso 9000 standards and is subject to inspection by an independent iso agency tecma has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel for the manufacture and distribution of invisalign we conduct frequent visits to the mexico facility to monitor tecma’s performance and its compliance with regulatory requirements and we also perform independent audits of their quality system 

  

in november 1998 we received 510k premarket clearance by the fda for the invisalign system allowing us to market invisalign in the us the manufacture and distribution of invisalign are subject to continuing oversight by the fda including routine inspections to determine compliance with quality system 

  

index to financial statements regulations our facility is registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer and is subject to state inspections 

  

during inspections of our facility and those of our contract manufacturer if the fda determines that we or our contract manufacturer have failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market products and criminal prosecution 

  

health canada’s medical device regulations we sell the invisalign system throughout canada as such we are required to comply with the health canada’s medical device regulations and we believe we are in compliance with their regulations 

  

european union’s mdd requirements  iso 13485 in europe the invisalign system is regulated as a custom device and as such we follow the medical device directives and are registered with an applicable competent authority in europe our facilities are iso 13485 certified which facilitates commercialization of invisalign in europe and other countries outside of the united states 

  

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996  under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of health information confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be maintained and released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information although compliance is principally the responsibility of the hospital physician or other healthcare provider the law requires that we execute business associate agreements with orthodontists and other healthcare professionals and comply with the privacy standard when we handle patient information and records we have designed our service offerings to enable compliance with hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations compliance with these laws and regulations is costly our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements and the privacy standard additionally the hipaa security standard which goes into effect in april 2005 requires that we implement safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of the electronic protected health information that we create receive maintain or transmit pursuant to our business associate agreements with health care professionals compliance with the security standard could require complex changes in our internal systems and could be costly 

  

other federal and state laws  as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

  

laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions of the social security act prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and other similar federal or state health care payment programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving 

  

index to financial statements our dental professional customers finally various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service for dentists and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions

 risk factors 

  

we have only recently experienced significant revenue growth and achieved profitability if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods the market price of our common stock may decline 

  

you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks expenses and difficulties encountered by a company in an early stage of operations since inception we incurred significant operating losses and we have only achieved profitability since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 from inception through july 2000 we spent significant funds on organizational and startup activities recruiting key managers and employees developing invisalign and developing our manufacturing and customer support resources we also spent significant funds on clinical trials and training programs to train dental professionals in the use of invisalign 

  

we continue to incur significant operating expenses to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as noted above we have only recently achieved profitability and as a result to sustain or increase profitability in future periods we will need to continue to increase our revenue while controlling our expenses we generated positive operating cash flow for the first time during fiscal year 2003 and we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase such positive cash flow from operations from period to period in the future in fact for fiscal 2005 we expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses as a result of several factors including our consumer advertising campaign dental professional marketing efforts continued international sales and marketing efforts and increases in the size of our sales force and dental professional training staff in addition legal expenses associated with the orthoclear litigation could result in an additional increase to our general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2005 furthermore we expect our cash and cash equivalents to decline in the first quarter of 2005 as we fund these and other business expenditures because our business is evolving it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth and we may not be able to sustain our historical growth rates in future periods if we do not sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors the market price of our common stock will likely decline 

  

we have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock price 

  

we were incorporated in april 1997 and began sales of invisalign in july 1999 thus we have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects in addition we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing our commercial sales these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

  

   

   

index to financial statements    

   

   

   

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenue for a particular period falls below our expectations we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels 

  

due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

  

we are currently involved in litigation with several former employees stemming from our efforts to protect our intellectual property this litigation may be costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 

  

we seek to diligently protect our intellectual property rights on february 2 2005 we filed a complaint against orthoclear inc orthoclear holdings inc one of our founders and several former employees among other things the complaint alleges tort contract statutory and common law causes of action arising from orthoclear and the individual defendants’ alleged plan to unlawfully utilize our intellectual property confidential information and employees the complaint also alleges that orthoclear chishti and other defendants are in breach of contractual obligations statutory law and common law for attempting to intentionally interfere and disrupt our ongoing business operations and improperly gain access to our customer relationships and trade secrets the complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages in an amount to be determined on february 15 2005 orthoclear chishti riepenhausen breeland tunnell kawaja and wen filed a multiclaim crosscomplaint against align thomas prescott roger george eldon bullington david thrower patricia wadors gil laks and kelsey wirth alleging conspiracy breach of contract libel slander unjust enrichment intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition although this lawsuit is in the early stages litigating claims of this type whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 

  

in addition we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however in the ormco litigation there is no assurance that the court’s decision will not be overturned on appeal in addition litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods 

  

see part i item 3 of this form 10k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 

  

index to financial statements our information technology systems are critical to our business system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results 

  

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources as our business has grown in size and complexity the growth has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our information technology systems to effectively manage this growth we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems to more effectively manage our operations 

  

in october 2004 we implemented a new version of our enterprise resource planning system and new software for our manufacturing execution system throughout 2005 we will integrate additional functionality into our manufacturing execution system which will more efficiently integrate this system with our other system applications such as customer facing and manufacturing tools system upgrades and enhancements require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 

  

in addition experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns furthermore sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems viruses and bugs could be significant and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations sales and operating results 

  

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

  

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “section 404” and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec to implement section 404 we are required to furnish a report to include in our form 10k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the report includes among other things an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

  

management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting requires management to make subjective judgments and because this requirement to provide a management report is newly effective some of our judgments will be in areas that may be open to interpretation therefore our management report may be uniquely difficult to prepare and our auditors who are required to issue an attestation report along with our management’s report may not agree with management’s assessments while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and as a result the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 

  

index to financial statements we depend on the sale of invisalign for the vast majority of our revenues and if demand for invisalign declines or fails to develop as we expect or if dental professionals or consumers do not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate or if orthodontists and gps do not collaborate as we expect our revenue will decline 

  

we expect that revenue from the sale of invisalign will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by both dental professionals and consumers is critical to our future success if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services or consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate or if orthodontists and gps do not collaborate as we expect our operating results could be harmed factors that could cause invisalign not achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect or at all are described more fully below 

  

dental professionals may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

  

our success depends upon increasing acceptance of invisalign by dental professionals invisalign requires dental professionals and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways in addition because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july 1997 and commercially available only since july 1999 dental professionals may be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available also increasing adoption and cumulative use by dental professionals will depend on factors such as the capability safety efficacy ease of use price quality and reliability of our products and our provision of effective sales support training and service in the future unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and consequently reduced acceptance by dental professionals if invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and gp communities our operating results will be harmed 

  

consumers may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

  

in addition our success depends upon the acceptance of invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental professionals as well as potential patients to whom we are now actively marketing invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and patients may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment in addition patients may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for invisalign which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment we have generally received positive feedback from both dental professionals and patients regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety reliability improved treatment aesthetics and greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products furthermore consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience adoption by consumers may also be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in north america and internationally which fluctuate and could be affected by unstable global economic political or other conditions 

  

the orthodontist and gps may choose not to collaborate and referrals between orthodontists and gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 

  

our success depends in part upon improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gp dentists although orthodontists have historically generated a majority of our revenues there exists a significantly greater number of general practitioners in north america than orthodontists and we expect to generate the majority of our revenue from gps in 2005 as the primary care dental provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and in certain instances may chose to treat less complex cases themselves if this collaboration and increase in referrals does not occur or occurs more slowly than we anticipate our operating results could be harmed 

  

index to financial statements we are dependent on our international manufacturing operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

  

currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of our clincheck ™ product and are used to manufacture aligner molds a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners and ships the completed products to our customers our costs associated with these operations are denominated in costa rican colons mexican pesos and us dollars 

  

our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if any of these risks materialize in the future our operating results may be harmed 

  

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed 

  

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of december 31 2004 we had 56 issued us patents 82 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications 

  

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur see part i item 3 of this form 10k for a summary of the orthoclear litigation our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our 

  

index to financial statements technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect our pricing and market share 

  

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business will be severely limited 

  

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of third party’s patents in the past and while these actions have been dismissed we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 

  

from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

  

see part i item 3 of this form 10k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 

  

we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process and if our access to these inputs is diminished our business may be harmed 

  

we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process we rely on a third party manufacturer in mexico to fabricate aligners and to ship the completed product to customers as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed any difficulties encountered by the third party manufacturer with respect to hiring personnel and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible 

  

in addition we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of delivery delays or shortages of these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

  

we have experienced rapid growth and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business 

  

we have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in 1999 our headcount increased from approximately 50 employees as of december 31 1999 to approximately 969 employees as of december 31 2004 this expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the us and internationally in particular rapid growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas including recruiting and retaining sufficient skilled personnel providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards and preserving our culture and values our inability to effectively manage this level of growth could harm our business 

  

index to financial statements if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

  

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development sales and marketing personnel and management teams the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel including orthodontists few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

  

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies who may introduce new technologies in the future 

  

currently our invisalign product competes directly against a product called red white and blue which is manufactured and distributed by ormco a subsidiary of sybron dental specialties in addition manufacturers of traditional braces such as 3m company sybron dental specialties and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors our business could be harmed for instance on february 2 2005 we filed a lawsuit against orthoclear inc orthoclear holdings inc zia chishti and several former employees we believe that orthoclear intends to introduce and market a competitive product into the market place although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights and prevent orthoclear from releasing any product that infringes on our intellectual property if orthoclear is ultimately successful in entering the market with a competitive product our business could be harmed 

  

complying with regulations enforced by the food and drug administration fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

  

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies which may include any of the following sanctions 

  

   

   

index to financial statements    

   

   

   

if any of these events were to occur they could harm our business 

  

we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections we have not yet been subject to an fda inspection and we cannot assure you we will successfully pass such an inspection in the future our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or our failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process 

  

before we can sell a new medical device in the us or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval unless an exemption applies obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

  

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer and we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

  

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations regarding the security of healthcare information we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

  

if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

  

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

  

the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and the business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the affect of hipaa and newly enacted regulations on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address 

  

index to financial statements the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities additionally the hipaa security standard which goes into effect in april 2005 requires that we implement safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of the electronic protected health information that we create receive maintain or transmit pursuant to our business associate agreements with healthcare professionals compliance with the security standard could require complex changes in our internal systems and services and could be costly 

  

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

  

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

  

   

   

   

complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

  

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

  

we currently sell our products in europe canada the united kingdom mexico brazil australia and hong kong and may expand into other countries from time to time we do not know whether orthodontists dentists and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate in addition sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all 

  

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

  

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

  

in fiscal 2004 the market price for our common stock was volatile 

  

the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control the factors include 

  

   

index to financial statements    

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future we would incur substantial legal fees and our management’s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

  

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

  

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 

  

changes in or interpretations of accounting rules and regulations such as expensing of stock options could result in unfavorable accounting charges 

  

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows 

  

   

   

   

in particular the fasb recently enacted sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which we will adopt effective the third quarter fiscal 2005 as a result we expect that sfas 123r will have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results and may impact the way in which we conduct our business

index to financial statements employee or consultant that he or she will be subject to criminal charges or a civil lawsuit if that person elects to change his or her employment status with align unless align has good cause to believe criminal conduct has been or will be committed or that a civil cause of action will lie against the employee or consultant the court also required the align parties to refrain from taking any actions inconsistent with federal or state securities laws relating to the issuance or redemption of align stock the court scheduled an order to show cause hearing why a preliminary injunction should not be issued in accordance with the terms of the tro for march 8 2005 on march 1 2005 the court signed a stipulated preliminary injunction order whereby the court ordered that the march 8th hearing date be vacated and further ordered that the express terms of the tro remain in place until the earlier of i trial ii written agreement of the parties or further court order setting an earlier termination or iii as to the preliminary injunction regarding nonsolicitation or recruiting of align employees or consultants only october 27 2005 align denies the allegations in the crosscomplaint and will vigorously defend against such claims no trial date has been set in the case 

  

on january 6 2003 ormco corporation “ormco” filed suit against us in the united states district court for the central district orange county division asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 5683243 and 6244861 the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief on february 18 2003 we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of the asserted patents in addition we counterclaimed for infringement of our us patent no 6398548 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on march 10 2003 and asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6398548 we responded to ormco’s counterclaims on april 2 2003 we amended our counterclaim to add allesee orthodontic appliances inc “aoa” a whollyowned subsidiary of ormco as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of us patent no 6398548 the court then permitted ormco to amend its complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional patent each ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of us patent no 6616444 on october 15 2003 on october 27 2003 we filed an answer to ormco’s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6616444 and for infringement of us patent no 6554611 

  

in connection with these claims the court granted five motions for summary judgment that we filed first on may 14 2004 the court granted our motion for summary judgment of noninfringement finding that our invisalign system does not infringe any of the asserted ormco patents 5477432 5683243 6244861 and 6616644 second on july 2 2004 the court granted in part our motion for summary judgment of infringement finding that ormco and aoa infringe certain but not all claims of our patents nos 6398548 and 6554611 through the manufacture and sale of red white  blue appliances third on august 26 2004 the court granted our motion for summary judgment of invalidity of ormco’s asserted patents claims 5477432 5683243 6244861 and 6616644 as noted above the court earlier found that we do not infringe these patents in addition the court also denied ormco’s motion for summary judgment seeking a finding of invalidity of our asserted patent claims 6398548 and 6554611 fourth the court granted our summary judgment motion that our asserted patent claims are not invalid based on the evidence currently before the court although the court granted that motion it reopened discovery on two additional invalidity arguments ormco asserted fifth the court also granted our summary judgment motion that our patents are not unenforceable and granted ormco’s summary judgment motion that ormco did not willfully infringe our patents

index to financial statements litigating claims of these types whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

align technology founded in april 1997 designs manufactures and markets invisalign a proprietary method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear nearly invisible removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition align technology received fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998 and we began commercial operations in july 1999 

  

the invisalign product is manufactured in phases the initial step in our manufacturing process is the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck ™  an internally developed computermodeling program these treatment plans are developed in our operations facility in costa rica and are transmitted electronically back to the prescribing dental profession via clincheck ™  clincheck ™ allows dental professionals to simulate treatment in three dimensions by modeling twoweek stages of tooth movement upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck ™ simulation we use the data underlying the simulation in conjunction with stereolithography technology to manufacture aligner molds a third party manufacturer in mexico uses these molds to fabricate aligners aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck ™ simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck ™  after the aligners are produced the third party manufacturer ships the finished products to our customers 

  

we have two customer channels the orthodontist and the gp we have historically generated a majority of our revenues from orthodontists there exists however a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists as the primary care dental provider gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients on the benefits of oral care and introduce them to invisalign gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and may choose to treat less complex cases themselves we are committed to improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps we believe that improved collaboration is beneficial to the orthodontist and the gp and will accelerate growth in invisalign cases and consequently increase our revenues in addition although we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications we expect that the percentage of revenue generated by gps will increase largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists in 2005 we expect to generate the majority of our revenue from gps we believe the expected increase in the number of cases treated by gps will result in an increase in the overall market for invisalign as patients that would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by their gps 

  

sales to orthodontists and gps in our domestic market represented approximately 90 of our total revenue during fiscal 2004 we expect to continue to increase our penetration into our domestic market we will also focus our efforts towards the expansion of our international markets in fiscal 2005 we expect to increase our infrastructure and support in key countries in europe and initiate strategic moves in asia specifically in japan in order to take advantage of this emerging opportunity 

  

clinical education and ongoing training are critical to our customers’ success with invisalign we certify several thousand new orthodontists and gps to use invisalign annually and we certified approximately 4200 orthodontists and gps during fiscal 2004 and we expect to certify approximately 4000 during fiscal 2005 additionally we share product enhancements treatment tips and techniques and clinical research data with our 

  

index to financial statements customers on an ongoing basis through continuing education in the form of hundreds of provider workshops study clubs and online educational centers this information ensures that our customers understand invisalign’s expanding applications and best uses and feel confident about treating more of their patients with invisalign 

  

net revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 was 1728 million an increase of 41 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was driven primarily by an increase in the number of cases submitted for the domestic general practitioner channel revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were reduced by approximately 19 million as a result of our case refinement policy change described below in certain instances adjustments to a patient’s teeth are made in the final stages of orthodontic treatment to make these final adjustments and move a patient’s teeth to the final desired position dental professionals may elect to use invisalign as a finishing treatment tool and order newly manufactured aligners these newly manufactured aligners or “case refinement” are not provided with the aligners produced as part of the initial treatment plan and are manufactured only upon the request of the dental professional if final adjustments are desired align’s case refinement policy allows doctors to order one case refinement as part of their original lab fee provided they submit the order prior to the point in time when the case is deemed completed or the “case expiration” prior to the policy change announced in the fourth quarter of 2004 align deemed the case expiration date to occur on the 90th day after the expected end of treatment under the new policy the case expiration date is deemed to occur on the 180th day after the expected end of treatment gross profit percentage increased in fiscal 2004 to 67 from 58 for fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily attributable to improved fixed cost absorption related to increasing volumes and continued manufacturing process improvements in both our treatment operations facility in costa rica and in the aligner fabrication process 

  

we recently filed a multiclaim lawsuit against one of our founders and certain former employees among other things the lawsuit alleges tortious and illegal actions arising out of the defendants’ plan to unlawfully utilize our intellectual property confidential information and employees in addition the lawsuit alleges that the defendants are in breach of contractual obligations statutory law and common law for the purpose of attempting to intentionally interfere and disrupt our ongoing operations and improperly gain access to our customer relationships and trade secrets on february 15 2005 orthoclear chishti and certain other defendants filed a multiclaim crosscomplaint against align and certain of our executive officers senior management and a director alleging conspiracy breach of contract libel slander unjust enrichment international interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition see part i item 3 of this form 10k for a more complete summary of this legal proceeding we are in the early stages of evaluating the impact if any the events underlying this litigation may have on our business competitive position in the market our ability to retain our sales representatives and other matters related to the sale of our product in addition although this lawsuit is in the early stages litigation of this type whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations as a result this litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and cause a decline in our stock price 

  

changes to previously announced fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and fiscal yearend results 

  

on january 26 2005 we announced our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended december 31 2004 subsequent to that date we adjusted the cost of revenues for the quarter and year ended december 31 2004 to include an additional 383000 resulting from asset impairment charges identified by the company relating to manufacturing fixed assets at our international manufacturing facility net profit for the quarter and year ended december 31 2004 was reduced by 383000 and there was no change to basic or diluted earnings per share

revenues invisalign product revenues by channel and other revenue which represented training and sales of ancillary products for the year ended december 31 2004 and 2003 are as follows 

  

    

cost of revenues cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2004 was 575 million compared to 516 million for the year ended december 31 2003 cost of revenues includes the salaries for staff involved in production the cost of materials and packaging shipping costs depreciation on the capital equipment used in the production process training costs and the cost of facilities also included in cost of revenues are stockbased compensation expenses of 09 million and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 

  

index to financial statements respectively gross profit for the year ended december 31 2004 was 1153 million or 67 of revenue compared to a gross profit of 712 million or 58 of revenue for the year ended december 31 2003 the higher gross profit for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 is primarily attributable to improved fixed cost absorption related to increasing volumes continued manufacturing process improvements in both our treatment operations facility in costa rica and in the aligner fabrication process 

  

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 were 559 million compared to 437 million for the year ended december 31 2003 sales and marketing expenses include sales force compensation combined with travel related costs and expenses for professional marketing programs conducting workshops and market surveys advertising and dental professional trade show attendance sales and marketing expenses include stockbased compensation expenses of 07 million and 22 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the increase in sales and marketing expense of 122 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 resulted primarily from an increase in spending of 44 million related to incremental headcount in our north american sales and marketing work force 09 million related to north america sales force training 27 million related to our international workforce and outside services and 59 million related to increases in media advertising costs marketing promotions and other related expenses the increase in spending was partially offset by the decrease of 15 million in stockbased compensation expense the increases during fiscal 2004 have been consistent with our marketing and sales initiatives and we expect these initiatives to continue in fiscal 2005 accordingly we expect sales and marketing expense to increase during fiscal 2005 as we continue to invest in sales force staffing new media programs web site enhancements directtoconsumer advertising and clinical education 

  

general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 were 339 million compared to 343 million for the year ended december 31 2003 general and administrative expenses included salaries for administrative personnel outside consulting services legal expenses and general corporate expenses general and administrative expenses include stockbased compensation expenses of 27 million and 71 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the 04 million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 was primarily due to the decrease in stockbased compensation expense of 44 million and legal fees of 24 million the decrease in litigation spending was primarily due to the settlement charge of 21 million included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 related to the conclusion of the discus arbitration proceedings the decreased expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 was partially offset by increases of 42 million in payroll expenses related to additional headcount and 21 million in general corporate expenses 

  

research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2004 were 158 million and 131 million for the year ended december 31 2003 research and development expenses include the costs associated with software engineering the cost of designing developing and testing our products and conducting clinical and postmarketing trials we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred research and development expenses included 16 million and 32 million of stockbased compensation for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 receptively the increase in research and development for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 of 27 million resulted from increased spending of 32 million for product improvement initiatives and the 11 million severance charge related to the departure of our vice president of engineering partially offset by a 16 million decrease in stockbased compensation expense for the fiscal 2005 we expect to increase research and development spending for new products conducting clinical research and product improvement initiatives

income tax provision income tax provision for 2004 and 2003 was 10 million and 01 million respectively our effective tax rate was 102 and 042 for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively our expected effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 is 100 as of december 31 2004 we had aggregate federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of 3242 million as of december 31 2004 we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization we have aggregate federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of 69 million as of december 31 2004 the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in the year 2017 for federal and 2005 for state purposes if not utilized utilization of the federal net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited by the change of ownership provisions contained in section 382 of the internal revenue code the federal research credit carryforwards expire beginning in the year 2017 if not utilized the state research credit carryforward does not expire 

  

stockbased compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and nonemployees prior to 2001 we recorded deferred stockbased compensation as a component of stockholders’ equity deferred stockbased compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price for stock options granted to nonemployees the fair value of the options estimated using the blackscholes valuation model is initially recorded on the date of grant as the nonemployee options vest we remeasure the remaining unvested options with the change in fair value from period to period represented as a change in deferred compensation this stockbased compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options for fiscal 2004 and 2003 we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of 51 million and 128 million respectively 

  

we recorded expenses of 04 million and 13 million for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively related to options granted to nonemployees after january 26 2001 

  

historically we have accelerated the vesting of options to several employees in connection with severance packages these accelerations were accounted for as a charge to the consolidated statements of operations we recorded 04 million for fiscal 2004 related to the departure of our vice president of engineering and we recorded 10 million for fiscal 2003 related to certain other executives this charge is equal to the intrinsic value of the options which was calculated as a difference between the exercise price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of acceleration

stockbased compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and nonemployees prior to 2001 we recorded deferred stockbased compensation as a component of stockholders’ equity deferred stockbased compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price for stock options granted to nonemployees the fair value of the options estimated using the blackscholes valuation model is initially recorded on the date of grant as the nonemployee options vest we revalue the remaining unvested options with the change in fair value from period to period represented as a change in deferred compensation this stockbased compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options for the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of 128 million and 160 million respectively additionally we recorded expenses of 13 million and 20 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively related to options granted to nonemployees

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which requires the measurement of all employee sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvaluebased method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income the accounting provisions of sfas 123r are effective for reporting periods 

  

index to financial statements beginning after june 15 2005 we will adopt sfas 123r effective as of the third quarter of fiscal 2005 the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition see note 2 stockbased compensation on page 59 for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts for fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2004 as if we had used a fairvaluebased method similar to the methods required under sfas 123r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas 123r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 we are evaluating the requirements under sfas 123r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

historically we have funded our operations with the proceeds from the sale of our common and preferred stock and from cash generated from sales of our product as of december 31 2004 we had 697 million of cash and cash equivalents and 03 million of restricted cash we had an accumulated deficit of 2918 million as of december 31 2004 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 246 million and 121 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2004 resulted primarily from operating profit and year over year changes in working capital for the year ended december 31 2003 net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue partially offset by operating losses 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 60 million and 43 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively for the year ended december 31 2004 net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the purchase of property and equipment for capacity expansion and manufacturing improvements including approximately 32 million for the implementation of the new version of our enterprise resource planning system and a new software application for our manufacturing process partially offsetting these purchases were proceeds from the sale of equipment and maturities of marketable securities during fiscal 2004 for the year ended december 31 2003 net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the purchase of property and equipment for capacity expansion and manufacturing improvements and purchases of marketable securities partially offset by maturities of marketable securities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities was 61 million and 16 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively for the year ended december 31 2004 net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options partially offset by payments on debt obligations related to the equipmentbased term loan and capital lease obligations for the year ended december 31 2003 net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from exercises of employee stock options and proceeds from payment on stockholders’ notes receivable partially offset by payments on debt obligations related to the equipmentbased term loan and capital lease obligations 

  

in december 2003 we negotiated a 150 million revolving line of credit based on domestic accounts receivable which accrues interest at a rate of 05 above prime accessing the accounts receivable based revolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and compliance with certain loan covenants we have not drawn down the revolving line of credit 

  

in december 2002 we obtained and accessed a 50 million equipmentbased term loan which accrues interest at a rate of 225 above prime we did not drawn down on any new funds in fiscal 2004 as of december 31 2004 the equipmentbased term loan had an outstanding balance of 17 million principal payments are due in 36 monthly installments beginning in january 2003 annual principal payment of 17 million is due for fiscal 2005 

  

index to financial statements during the quarter ended december 31 2004 we determined that we were out of compliance with our loan covenants for the accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit and equipmentbased term loan requiring certain financial ratios and measurements to be maintained the loan covenant requirements were amended as of january 28 2005 as a result of the amendment we are in full compliance with our loan covenants for the quarter ended december 31 2004 

  

contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements 

  

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 

  

    

   

we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations promulgated under the securities act 

  

as discussed under “item 3—legal proceedings” we are currently involved in litigation with orthoclear inc one of our founders and several former employees this litigation is in its preliminary stages and it is not yet possible to determine its ultimate outcome at this time we cannot estimate the impact this litigation may have on our future cash requirements 

  

we expect that our operating expenses will increase commensurate with an overall increase in the level of our business activity including increased sales and the related costs of products sold continuing efforts to automate our manufacturing processes and development and improvements to our product we also expect operating expenses to increase due to our consumer advertising campaign dental professional marketing efforts continued international sales and marketing efforts increases in the size of our sales force and dental professional training staff and increases in our research and development expenses as we develop new products and enhancements to invisalign in addition we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market sell and support our products on a worldwide basis we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we could be required to delay our efforts to develop new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing process execute our 

  

index to financial statements consumer marketing campaign and dental professional marketing efforts develop clinical research and education plans or to otherwise reduce our expenditures in general accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable legal contingencies and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin or sab no 104 revenue recognition and eitf 0021 sab no 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists shipments have occurred the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered involve management’s judgments based on whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment eitf 0021 addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 

  

revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable the costs of producing the clincheck ™ treatment plan which are incurred prior to the production of aligners are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned in certain instances adjustments to a patient’s teeth are made in the final stages of orthodontic treatment to make these final adjustments and move a patient’s teeth to the final desired position dental professionals may elect to use invisalign as a finishing treatment tool and order newly manufactured aligners these newly manufactured aligners or “case refinement” are not provided with the aligners produced as part of the initial treatment plan and are manufactured only upon the request of the dental professional if final adjustments are desired align’s case refinement policy allows doctors to order one case refinement as part of their original lab fee provided they submit the order prior to the point in time when the case is deemed completed or the “case expiration” prior to our policy change during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we deemed the case expiration date to occur on the 90th day after the expected end of treatment under the new policy the case expiration date is deemed to occur on the 180th day after the expected end of treatment 

  

from june 2001 through april 2003 we offered our dental professionals the opportunity at the time of the creation of the initial treatment plan to purchase at a discount a onetime nonrefundable case refinement revenue in the amount of the standalone sales price of the undelivered element is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or if case refinement was never requested the point in time when the case is deemed completed or “case expiration” in cases where the dental professional did not purchase case refinement in advance case refinement revenues if any are recognized when the new aligners are shipped 

  

index to financial statements we updated our domestic and international pricing policies in may 2003 and january 2004 respectively to include the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of 125 each and at a comparable price internationally which we believe represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings revenue deferrals associated with future case refinement after may 1 2003 are 125 per case and a comparable price internationally after january 2004 this revenue deferral amount represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with eitf 0021 which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services these revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been shipped or upon case expiration whichever is earliest 

  

service revenues earned for training of dental professionals and staff for invisalign are recorded as the services are performed service revenues earned under agreements with third parties are based on negotiated rates which are intended to approximate a markup on our anticipated costs 

  

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

  

warranty expense 

  

aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case in completed in the event the aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays for the additional expense the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign 

  

we generally warrant our products for a specific period of time against material defects we accrue for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in costs of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized the accrued warranty costs represent the best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we expect to incur to repair or replace product which fails while still under warranty the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs actual warranty costs could differ from the estimate amounts on a quarterly basis we review the accrued balances and update these balances based on historical warranty cost trends actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future it would negatively affect operating results 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments we periodically review these estimated allowances including an analysis of the customers’ payment history and information regarding the customers’ creditworthiness if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments an additional allowance may be required which would negatively impact our operating results 

  

accounting for longlived assets 

  

we assess the impairment of longlived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors 

  

index to financial statements that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in the stock price for a sustained period and the market capitalization relative to net book value if these factors or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges which would negatively impact operating results 

  

legal contingencies 

  

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements because of uncertainties related to both the potential amount and range of loss from pending litigation management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an unfavorable outcome in these legal proceedings as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to this pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly revisions of our estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance 

  

we have established a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 

  

while we have considered potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative disclosures 

  

we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 

  

interest rate risk  we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents availableforsale marketable securities existing longterm debts and any future financing requirements interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by monitoring maturities in our marketable securities portfolio our longterm debt at december 31 2004 consists of outstanding balances on capital lease obligations of 02 million and a 17 million equipmentbased term loan 

  

the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities do not exceed fiscal year 2004 and the interest rates are primarily fixed our capital lease obligations of 02 million at december 31 2004 carry fixed interest rates of 653 and 1115 per annum with principal payments due in 60 and 48 monthly installments respectively which began in 2000 

  

in december 2002 we obtained a 50 million equipmentbased term loan which accrues interest at a rate of 225 above prime in december 2002 we had drawn down 50 million from the equipmentbased term loan principal payments are due in 36 monthly installments which began in january 2003 

  

the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amounts and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and longterm debt instruments 

  

   

qualitative disclosures 

  

interest rate risk  our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to 

  

   

   

   

we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity as a result we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and longterm marketable securities portfolio 

  

we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding longterm debts through the use of fixed rate debt management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis 

  

index to financial statements currency rate risk  our primary currency rate risk exposures relate to our decentralized or outsourced operations whereby approximately 156 million of our annual expenses are related to operations outside the united states denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

  

we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures or intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates the exposure related to currency rate movements would not likely have a material impact on future net income or cash flows for the foreseeable future

overview 

  

since our inception in april 1997 we have been engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of invisalign a proprietary system for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth the invisalign product has two components clincheck ™ and aligners clincheck ™ is an internetbased application that allows dental professionals to simulate treatment in three dimensions by modeling twoweek stages of tooth movement aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck ™ simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck ™  

  

two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck ™ and are used in conjunction with stereolithography technology to manufacture aligner molds a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners from the molds and ships the completed products to our customers 

  

revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable the costs of producing the clincheck ™ treatment plan which are incurred prior to the production of aligners are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned ie upon shipment of the aligners 

  

in cases where the dental professional elects to finish the treatment plan using invisalign the dental professional orders case refinement from june 2001 through april 2003 we offered our dental professionals the opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount the advance purchase price was nonrefundable revenue in the amount of the standalone sales price of the undelivered element is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or case expiration in cases where the dental professional did not purchase case refinements in advance case refinement revenues are recognized when the new aligners are shipped 

  

in may 2003 we updated our domestic pricing policy to include the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of 125 each which we believe represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings revenue deferrals associated with future case refinement sales are 125 per case this revenue deferral amount represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 0021 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 0021 which addresses the issue of accounting for 

  

arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services these revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been utilized or upon case expiration which ever is earliest 

  

service revenues earned for training of dental professionals and staff for invisalign are recorded as the services are performed service revenues earned under agreements with third parties are based on negotiated rates which are intended to approximate a markup on our anticipated costs 

  

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

  

industry background 

  

malocclusion 

  

malocclusion the misalignment of teeth is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting over 200 million individuals or approximately 75 of the us population approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us generating industry revenues of approximately 7 billion while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional treatment 

  

traditional orthodontic treatment 

  

currently dental professionals apply traditional techniques and principles of orthodontic treatment developed in the early 20th century in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patient’s teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices 

  

the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient’s teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement because of the length of time between visits the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient’s teeth 

  

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us 3500 to 7000 with a median fee of approximately 4500 generally only a portion of the fees are reimbursed by insurance if covered at all in addition dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional’s estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time or reduced profitability for the dental professional 

  

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment 

  

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability 

  

the align solution 

  

invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion invisalign consists of two components clincheck ™ and aligners 

  

clincheck ™  clincheck ™ is an interactive internet application that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatment for their patients we use a dental impression and a treatment prescription submitted by a dental professional to develop a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments clincheck ™ allows the dental professional to view this three dimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly clincheck ™ enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible 

  

upon review of the clincheck ™ simulation the dental professional may immediately approve the projected treatment or may provide us with feedback for modification we reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck ™ simulation we use the data underlying the simulation to manufacture the patient’s aligners 

  

aligners  aligners are custommanufactured clear removable dental appliances that when worn in a prescribed series provide orthodontic treatment each aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck ™ treatment simulation after two weeks of use the patient discards the aligners and replaces them with the next pair in the series this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use invisalign aligners as a retainer or go directly to a conventional retainer 

  

benefits of invisalign 

  

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces 

  

benefits to the dental professional 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

benefits to the patient 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of conventional braces 

  

limitations of invisalign 

  

in some instances invisalign may have certain limitations relative to conventional treatment aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in conventional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional the cost of invisalign to the patient may be greater than for conventional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there is generally a turnaround time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal results in addition because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech we believe that these limitations are outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 

  

our target market and patient base 

  

medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness class i or ii devices require the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification to the food and drug administration or the fda requesting permission for commercial distribution which is known as 510k clearance we obtained our 510k clearance in september 1998 our 510k clearance allows us to market invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion with mature dentition we voluntarily restrict the use of invisalign to adults and adolescents with mature dentition individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially complete jaw growth this group represents approximately 160 million people in the us typically permanent dentition are fully erupted between the ages of 11 and 15 years currently we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing as the effectiveness of invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment based on our clinical studies to date we recommend that dental professionals use invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for severe malocclusions 

  

approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us these patients represent approximately one percent of the population of people with malocclusion of these we estimate 50 or more than one million patients have mature dentition and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign 

  

in addition we believe that we have an immediate and substantial market expansion opportunity our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces persons with malocclusion will be more likely to seek treatment we believe that adults who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment represent our most significant market expansion opportunity 

  

commercial sales of invisalign commenced in the us in july 1999 as of december 31 2003 approximately 155000 patients worldwide had entered treatment using invisalign internationally the company operates through three business segments divided among the geographic regions of europe asiapacific and latin america in 2003 international sales accounted for approximately 9 of the company’s net sales 

  

in each of fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

  

we continue to focus on the domestic market opportunity and on selected international markets 

  

business strategy 

  

our objective is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic malocclusion key elements of our strategy include the following 

  

educate dental professionals and stimulate demand for invisalign treatment  our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually we advertise nationally using a broad marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of applicability of invisalign in october 2001 we expanded our training of dental professionals in our domestic market to include general practitioner dentists as of december 31 2003 we had trained approximately 24000 dental professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of invisalign 

  

expand and enhance manufacturing capability  our manufacturing operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom aligners at a high level of quality to improve cost efficiency we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively lowwage countries we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process by continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes we plan to increase the level of production automation increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both unit costs and production times 

  

extend and defend technology leadership  invisalign represents a significant technological advancement in orthodontics we believe that our issued patents multiple pending patents and other intellectual property provide us with a substantial lead over potential competitors our issued us patents broadly cover the invisalign ® system including digital modeling and manipulation of scanned patient data treatment planning and fabrication of dental appliances among others we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 

  

expand number of clinicians and utilization within their practices invisalign can provide complete treatment for patients with mature dentition and a broad range of malocclusion in addition we believe that invisalign can provide partial treatment of severe malocclusion in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s ability to comprehensively treat such cases we have published a series of clinical case studies and articles that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases of severe complexity we have also launched new studies in fiscal 2003 with universities worldwide and we are making additional improvements to our product we are also expanding the clinical education and training sessions for our customers 

  

manufacturing 

  

we produce highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume to do so we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions computed tomography known as ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 

  

we believe the complexity inherent in producing such highly customized devices in high volumes is a barrier to potential competitors furthermore we believe the sophisticated software we use to guide a custom manufacturing process on a high volume was not available until we developed it we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 

  

manufacturing is coordinated in santa clara california digital dental modeling is processed in our 63000 square foot facility in san jose costa rica as of december 31 2003 we employed a manufacturing staff in the us and costa rica of approximately 427 people the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck ™ treatments using simulation software we outsource the fabrication and packaging of aligners to a contract manufacturer based in juarez mexico information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations may be found in part ii item 7 of this report on form 10k under the heading “risk factors” 

  

the invisalign treatment process 

  

the invisalign treatment process comprises the following five stages 

  

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches xrays of the patient’s dentition photographs of the patient a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient’s upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form or prescription the impression is a critical component of invisalign as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patient’s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patient’s teeth the prescription is also a critical component of invisalign describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our santa clara facility 

  

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition using ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional’s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in costa rica 

  

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck ™  in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulation is then reviewed for adherence 

  

to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon passing review the simulation is then delivered to the prescribing dental professional via clincheck ™  which is available on our website at wwwinvisaligncom and wwwaligntechcom the dental professional then reviews the clincheck ™ simulation and on occasion asks us to make adjustments by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to review clincheck ™  allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professional then approves the proposed treatment and in doing so engages us for the manufacture of corresponding aligners 

  

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment  we use the approved clincheck ™ simulation to construct a series of molds of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment these molds are fabricated at our santa clara california manufacturing facility using custom manufacturing techniques including stereolithography that we have adapted for use in orthodontic applications 

  

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional  from these molds our contract manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold the aligners are then trimmed polished cleaned and packaged following final inspection the aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental professional we ship all of the aligners in a single batch in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with clear attachments bonded to the patient’s teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement 

  

in certain cases we provide an alignerlike template to the dental professionals to aide the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s teeth these attachments are used to optimize the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movements also in cases where interproximal reduction or ipr is requested by the dental professional we provide an ipr prescription form quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction location and timing of ipr 

  

throughput management 

  

because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we do not build inventories as a result we must conservatively build manufacturing throughput for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

  

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continue to upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication of aligners currently conducted in mexico in order to scale our manufacturing capacity we continue to invest in facilities and capital equipment 

  

quality assurance 

  

align’s quality system is in compliance with food  drug administration’s medical device regulations 21cfr part 820 and health canada’s medical device regulations we are certified to iso 90011994 internationally recognized quality system standards and iso 134851996 internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing align has a formal documented quality system by which quality objectives are understood and achieved our quality system defines processes and procedures to ensure product and service quality and includes methods to monitor levels of quality based on internal data and direct customer feedback we utilize this data to continuously improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as required 

  

since we custom manufacture aligners on a buildtoorder basis we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck ™ and each aligner is unique we inspect 100 of the product at various points in the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers’ expectations aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed in the event the aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners 

  

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck ™ treatment plan deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient’s dentition to us we use the impressions to create a new clincheck ™ treatment plan for the dental professional to approve from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 

  

in the event that a dental professional wishes to effect additional adjustments to a patient’s treatment when the actual treatment results are in accordance with the approved clincheck ™ treatment plan the dental professional may request a case refinement or additional aligners our pricing policy includes the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and offers additional case refinements at the dental professional’s expense in addition should a dental professional request a replacement for a lost aligner we charge the dental professional for the cost of the replacement aligner 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we market invisalign by communicating invisalign’s benefits directly to dental professionals and consumers with a nationwide advertising campaign based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales in our test markets we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign in order to serve anticipated worldwide demand we are training a broad base of dental professionals 

  

professional marketing 

  

our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july 1999 in 2001 we began marketing invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market we provide training certification marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in the us and canada which we consider our domestic market and internationally 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had trained approximately 24000 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those dental professionals trained approximately 70 are dental professionals in our domestic market within our domestic market we have trained approximately 7700 orthodontists and approximately 9700 general practitioner dentists our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign prescription form clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck ™ software and the many other features of our website 

  

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment and we present our training material in a manner consistent with dental professionals’ training and experience our success in training a large number of dental professionals confirms our belief that training represents a minimal barrier to adoption for most dental professionals 

  

after training sales representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases such follow up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions establishing an internet connection and familiarizing them with our website sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

  

general practitioner dentists play an important role in informing their patients about orthodontics and are a key source of both referrals to orthodontists and invisalign case submissions there are over 130000 active general practice dentists in the us and canada 

  

consumer marketing 

  

our national consumer marketing efforts primarily focus on television advertising and are supported by other advertising media and public relations we advertise nationally using a broad marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand 

  

our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our marketing efforts have generated substantial consumer interest directed toward our telephone support line and our website our telephone support line and our website not only provide consumers with information on invisalign but also allow us to channel consumer interest to dental professionals we have outsourced the telephone support function to a national call center operator 

  

research and development 

  

prior to commercial launch in july 1999 our research and development strategy had three primary objectives developing the invisalign product establishing the ability of invisalign to treat malocclusion and developing software and processes to enable the manufacture of aligners in volume since our commercial launch our research and development effort has focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines our research and development expenses were 131 million for fiscal 2003 and 2002 and 156 million in fiscal 2001 

  

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities we have published a series of clinical case studies and articles that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process our product development team is testing enhanced materials and a number of complementary products that we expect will provide additional revenue opportunities 

  

in fiscal 2003 we continued to enhance our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software primarily to increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency 

  

intellectual property 

  

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2003 we had 41 issued us patents 73 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications 

  

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products 

  

competition 

  

we compete directly with companies such as ormco orthodontics a wholly owned subsidiary of sybron dental specialties which manufactures and distributes a product called red white  blue that is similar in use to invisalign we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of other orthodontic products these manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances include 3m company ormco orthodontics and dentsply international inc 

  

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

  

government regulation 

  

fda’s quality system regulation for medical devices invisalign is regulated as a class i medical device by food and drug administration accordingly our product development manufacturing processes packaging labeling handling storage and distribution activities are subject to extensive review by national and state government agencies to ensure that our devices are safe and effective 

  

the aligners are manufactured by the tecma group llc formerly known as elamex sa de cv a contract manufacturer based in mexico as a medical device company we are required to ensure that our contract manufacturer complies with fda’s quality system regulations as a result we have ensured that tecma is registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturer in addition tecma is certified to iso 9000 requirements and is subject to inspection by an independent iso agency we have also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes are set up at tecma to comply with all fda regulations tecma has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel for the manufacture and distribution of invisalign we conduct frequent visits to the mexico facility to monitor tecma’s performance and its compliance with our requirements and also perform independent audits of their quality system 

  

in november 1998 invisalign received 510k premarket clearance by the fda allowing us to market invisalign in the us the manufacture and distribution of invisalign are subject to continuing regulations by the fda we are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements our facility is registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer 

  

during inspections of our facility if fda determines that we have failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of our right to market products and criminal prosecution 

  

health canada’s medical device regulations in canada we comply with the health canada’s medical device regulations and as such align’s facility and products are registered with health canada we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted permission to market our products in canada 

  

european union’s mdd requirements  iso 9000 and iso 13485 in europe invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such we follow the medical device directives requirements and are registered with the competent authority in europe the fact that we are iso 9000 and iso 13485 certified facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe 

  

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996  under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information although compliance is principally the responsibility of the hospital physician or other healthcare provider our agreements with orthodontists and other healthcare professionals require that we comply with the privacy standard when providing technical services and when handling patient information and records we have designed our product and service offerings to enable compliance with hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in our systems and services additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements and the privacy standard 

  

other federal and state laws  as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

  

laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions of the social security act prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and similar other federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers finally various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service for dentists and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various 

  

requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

on january 6 2003 ormco corporation “ormco” filed suit against us in the united states district court for the central district orange county division asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 5683243 and 6244861 the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief on february 18 2003 we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of the asserted patents in addition we counterclaimed for infringement of our us patent no 6398548 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on march 10 2003 and asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6398548 we responded to ormco’s counterclaims on april 2 2003 we amended our counterclaim to add allesee orthodontic appliances inc “aoa” a whollyowned subsidiary of ormco as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of us patent no 6398548 the court then permitted ormco to amend its complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional patent each ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of us patent no 6616444 on october 15 2003 on october 27 2003 we filed an answer to ormco’s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6616444 and for infringement of us patent no 6554611 

  

at a scheduling conference held on november 24 2003 the court set a june 10 2004 discovery cutoff and an october 2004 trial date 

  

three years ago ormco filed suit against us asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 in june 2000 the parties entered into a stipulation of dismissal with ormco ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation with respect to these patents except as set forth below further ormco agreed that it would not bring any patent action against us for at least a period of one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents if ormco were to bring such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year the stipulation of dismissal would allow ormco to include in such an action claims involving us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 in august 2001 ormco notified us of the issuance of us patent no 6244861 and offered a license for this patent we did not take a license to this patent five months after ormco’s notification it filed the lawsuit that is currently pending 

  

the claims in us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 relate to methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances the relevant claims are limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient the claims in us patent nos 6244861 and 6616444 are more generic claims relating to the methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances based on the disclosure in the patent however the relevant claims also appear to be limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient the treatment plan simulation developed in our facilities determines the final positioning of a patient’s teeth but is not based on a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient 

  

the claims in our us patent nos 6398548 and 6554611 relate to methods and systems for incrementally moving teeth using a series of appliances designed to be placed successively on the patient’s teeth 

  

we strongly believe that ormco’s claims of infringement lack merit and that our counterclaim of infringement will be successful however the outcome of a lawsuit is inherently unpredictable should our technology be found to infringe any one of ormco’s asserted patents we would have to seek a license from ormco which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in that event we could be subject to damages or an injunction which could materially adversely affect our business 

  

on april 9 2002 we exercised our right to terminate an exclusive marketing agreement dated october 18 2001 with discus dental impressions inc the “agreement” pursuant to the express terms of the agreement and issued a press release reporting this termination on or about may 14 2002 we received a demand for arbitration submitted by discus dental with the american arbitration association in san jose california in its arbitration demand discus dental sought damages of approximately 30 million including commissions and bonus payments it claimed it would have allegedly received under the agreement as well as other expenses attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief to prevent us from selling invisalign to dentists in the us and canada based on a review of the factual and legal issues we denied all claims made by discus dental in its demand and contended that such claims were entirely without merit in addition on or about june 13 2002 we submitted a counterclaim against discus dental in the arbitration seeking damages of approximately 40 million arising out of our claims for misrepresentation breach of confidentiality provisions and unfair competition among others three arbitrators were selected the “panel” and the arbitration hearing commenced in san francisco on august 18 2003 the parties completed presenting witness testimony on september 9 2003 the parties completed all posthearing legal briefing on october 10 2003 and closing argument was heard on october 29 2003 at the closing argument before the panel discus dental sought lost profit damages of 465 million and loss of good willout of pocket damages of 135 million we voluntarily dismissed our damage counterclaims but maintained our counterclaim for declaratory relief seeking a judicial declaration that we properly terminated the agreement with discus dental 

  

on february 9 2004 the panel issued its final arbitration award which concluded the arbitration proceedings initiated by discus dental under the final arbitration award discus dental is entitled to a judgment in the amount of 100 in damages and reasonable attorney fees and costs in the amount of 21 million in reaching their decision the arbitrators found that align’s termination of its marketing agreement with discus dental in april of 2002 was wrongful we included the 21 million charge relating to the final arbitration award in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

  

overview 

  

since our inception in april 1997 we have been engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of invisalign a proprietary system for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth the invisalign product has two components clincheck ™ and aligners clincheck ™ is an internetbased application that allows dental professionals to simulate treatment in three dimensions by modeling twoweek stages of tooth movement aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck ™ simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck ™  

  

two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck ™ and are used in conjunction with stereolithography technology to manufacture aligner molds a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners from the molds and ships the completed products to our customers 

  

revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable the costs of producing the clincheck ™ treatment plan which are incurred prior to the production of aligners are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned ie upon shipment of the aligners 

  

in cases where the dental professional elects to finish the treatment plan using invisalign the dental professional orders case refinement from june 2001 through april 2003 we offered our dental professionals the opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount the advance purchase price was nonrefundable revenue in the amount of the standalone sales price of the undelivered element is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or case expiration in cases where the dental professional did not purchase case refinements in advance case refinement revenues are recognized when the new aligners are shipped 

  

in may 2003 we updated our domestic pricing policy to include the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of 125 each which we believe represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings revenue deferrals associated with future case refinement sales 

  

are 125 per case this revenue deferral amount represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with the newly adopted rules contained in eitf 0021 which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services these revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been utilized or upon case expiration which ever is earliest 

  

service revenues earned for training of dental professionals and staff for invisalign are recorded as the services are performed service revenues earned under agreements with third parties are based on negotiated rates which are intended to approximate a markup on our anticipated costs 

  

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

  

we have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have achieved profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as of december 31 2003 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 3006 million 

  

we expect to expend significant capital to continue to build consumer demand expand our dental professional channel automate our manufacturing processes and develop both product and process technology in november 2002 we completed a private placement of common stock to a group of investors led by existing shareholders raising 181 million net of issuance costs in december 2002 we secured an accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit of up to 100 million and in december 2003 negotiated more favorable terms and increased the line of credit up to 15 million in december 2002 we also secured an equipmentbased term loan of 50 million which was fully drawn down in december 2002 as of december 31 2003 we had not utilized the accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit as of december 31 2003 the equipmentbased term loan had an outstanding balance of 33 million accessing the accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and compliance with certain loan covenants however there can be no assurance that such financing will be adequate for us to avoid reducing operating expenses by among other things reducing planned capital expenditures relating to enhancing our manufacturing process and reducing worldwide staff 

  

litigation settlement included in general and administrative expenses on april 9 2002 we exercised our right to terminate an exclusive marketing agreement dated october 18 2001 with discus dental impressions inc pursuant to the express terms of the agreement and issued a press release reporting this termination on or about may 14 2002 we received a demand for arbitration submitted by discus dental with the american arbitration association in san jose california on february 9 2004 the panel issued its final arbitration award which concluded the arbitration proceedings initiated by discus dental under the final arbitration award discus dental is entitled to a judgment in the amount of 100 in damages and attorney fees and costs in the amount of 21 million in reaching their decision the arbitrators found that align’s termination of its marketing agreement with discus dental in april of 2002 was wrongful we included the 21 million charge relating to the final arbitration award in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

in july 2002 we announced a plan to streamline worldwide operations the plan included closing our facilities in pakistan and the uae we transitioned the operations performed at these facilities to the united states and costa rica for the period ending december 31 2002 we recorded severance charges of 23 million facility closure charges of 09 million a loss on disposal of fixed assets of 11 million and an impairment charge of 09 million related to the land in pakistan the land was written down to a zero value to reflect its fair value as estimated by our management approximately 01 million of accrued charges related to professional fees were included in accrued liabilities as of december 31 2002 we discontinued operations at our facilities in pakistan and the uae in october and december 2002 respectively we concluded the remainder of indirect operational activities related to the costa rica transition in january 2003 we will cease nonoperational closing activities in pakistan when the land is disposed of and in the uae when the necessary statutory filings have been completed 

  

comparison of years ended december 31 2003 and 2002

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 were 437 million compared to 453 million for the year ended december 31 2002 sales and marketing expenses include sales force compensation combined with expenses for professional marketing programs conducting workshops and market surveys advertising and attending dental professional trade shows sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 include stockbased compensation expenses of 22 million and 30 million respectively the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 resulted primarily from a decrease in spending of 23 million for international media and advertising and 17 million related to our restructuring of and reductions in our international sales and marketing work force the year ended december 31 2002 included restructuring charges of 12 million and no restructuring charges for the year ended december 31 2003 the reduction of the international sales and marketing work force in fiscal 2003 and the restructuring charges in fiscal 2002 were part of the plan during the second half of fiscal 2002 to streamline worldwide operations the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 were partially offset by an increase in spending of 39 million related to incremental headcount in our north american sales force and 05 million in incremental media and advertisement costs for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 we expect sales and marketing expense to increase as we invest more on clinical education directtoconsumer mail advertising and related consumer spending 

  

general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 were 343 million compared to 393 million for the year ended december 31 2002 general and administrative expenses included salaries for administrative personnel outside consulting services legal expenses and general corporate expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 include stockbased compensation expenses of 71 million and 107 million respectively the decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the year ended

interest and other income expense net interest and other income expense was 01 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and 01 million for the year ended december 31 2002 interest and other expenses increased by 02 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 interest income decreased by 04 million for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 primarily due to lower interest rates paid on cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances included in other expense is foreign currency translation gain which increased 04 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 

  

stockbased compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and nonemployees prior to 2001 we recorded deferred stockbased compensation as a component of stockholders’ equity deferred stockbased compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price for stock options granted to nonemployees the fair value of the options estimated using the blackscholes valuation model is initially recorded on the date of grant as the nonemployee options vest we revalue the remaining unvested options with the change in fair value from period to period represented as a change in deferred compensation this stockbased compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options for the year ended december 31 2003 and 2002 we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of 128 million and 160 million respectively additionally we recorded expenses of 13 million and 20 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively related to options granted to nonemployees 

  

we have accelerated the vesting of options to several employees in connection with severance packages this acceleration was accounted for as a charge to the consolidated statements of operations we recorded charges of 10 million and 22 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively each respective charge is equal to the intrinsic value difference between the exercise price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of acceleration

research and development  research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2002 were 131 million compared to 156 million for the year ended december 31 2001 research and development expenses include the costs associated with software engineering designing developing and testing our products and conducting clinical and postmarketing trials we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december 31 2002 was primarily due to a decrease in outside consulting services of approximately 12 million and a decrease in headcount expense related to product development activities of approximately 15 million research and development expenses for 2002 also included 01 million of restructuring charges incurred as part of our july 2002 plan to streamline worldwide operations and 32 million and 41 million of stock based compensation expense for 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

interest and other income expense net  interest and other income was 01 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to 17 million for the year ended december 31 2001 interest income decreased in fiscal 2002 by 33 million primarily due to the decrease in our cash cash equivalent and marketable securities 

  

balances interest income for the year ended december 31 2001 was primarily generated from our cash and cash equivalents balance and investments in shortterm marketable securities other expenses increased by 01 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 offsetting the overall decreases in interest and other income expense was a charge of 18 million in the first quarter of 2001 for noncash interest expense related to the beneficial conversion feature embedded in convertible subordinated notes 

  

dividend related to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock  in 2000 we issued 9535052 shares of series d preferred stock which were subject to an antidilution conversion price adjustment feature we triggered this antidilution conversion price adjustment feature when we granted options to purchase our common stock beyond the number of options that were authorized under our 1997 plan at the time we commenced our series d preferred stock offering in may 2000 the conversion feature provided that if during the period between may 12 2000 the commitment date for our series d preferred stock offering and the earlier of the closing of an initial public offering or january 31 2001 we had granted more than an aggregate of 3331978 options to purchase our common stock then the conversion price of our series d preferred stock would be adjusted downward from its original conversion price of 10625 per share as of the end of january 2001 we had granted an aggregate of 3591458 options to purchase shares of our common stock in excess of the 3331978 options permitted as a result we were required to issue an additional 790342 shares of common stock upon the conversion of the series d preferred stock these shares were in addition to the 419700 additional shares of common stock that we were required to issue upon conversion of the series d preferred stock as of december 31 2000 as a result we recorded a deemed dividend for the year ended december 31 2001 based on the fair value of the common stock we also recorded at the commitment date of the series d preferred stock offering 112 million related to the preferred stock sold and a charge to interest expense of 18 million for the beneficial conversion feature embedded in convertible subordinated notes that were previously converted in 2002 we had no issued and outstanding preferred stock and in 2002 we did not record any deemed dividends related to preferred stock 

  

stockbased compensation  in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and nonemployees we recorded deferred stockbased compensation as a component of stockholders’ equity deferred stockbased compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price for stock options granted to nonemployees the fair value of the options estimated using the blackscholes valuation model is initially recorded on the date of grant as the nonemployee options become exercisable we revalue the remaining unvested options with the change in fair value from period to period represented as a change in the deferred compensation charge this stockbased compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of 160 million and 222 million respectively additionally we recorded expenses of 20 million for the year ended december 31 2002 related to options granted to nonemployees 

  

we accelerated the vesting of options to several employees in connection with severance packages this acceleration was accounted for as a charge to the consolidated statements of operations the charge for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 were recorded as 22 million and 02 million respectively the charge is equal to the intrinsic value difference between the exercise price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of acceleration 

  

income taxes 

  

we have incurred immaterial amounts of income tax expense to date since we have not been profitable on an annual basis in either our domestic or international operations as of december 31 2003 we have aggregate federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of 2389 million as of december 31 2003 we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization we have aggregate federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of 41 million as of december 31 2003 

  

the federal research credit carryforwards expire beginning in the year 2017 if not utilized the state research credit carryforward does not expire the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in the year 2017 for federal and 2005 for state purposes if not utilized utilization of the federal net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited by the change of ownership provisions contained in section 382 of the internal revenue code 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

historically we have funded our operations with the proceeds from the sale of our common and preferred stock an equipmentbased term loan and bridge loans as of december 31 2003 we had 449 million of cash and cash equivalents 04 million of restricted cash and 23 million of shortterm marketable securities we had an accumulated deficit of 3006 million as of december 31 2003 

  

net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled 121 million and 404 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2003 resulted primarily from cash collections from customers increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from operating losses and increases in accounts receivable balances in fiscal 2002 over fiscal 2001 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 43 million for the year ended december 31 2003 and net cash provided by investing activities totaled 15 million for the year ended december 31 2002 for the year ended december 31 2003 net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the purchase of property and equipment for capacity expansion in costa rica for the year ended december 31 2002 net cash provided by investing activities resulted primarily from the maturities of marketable securities partially offset by the purchases of property and equipment 

  

net cash provided by financing activities were 16 million and 239 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively for both the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by payments on debt obligations in november 2002 we completed a private placement of 9578944 shares common stock to a group of investors led by existing shareholders raising 181 million net of issuance costs in december 2002 we accessed a 50 million equipmentbased term loan and the balance of the loan as of december 31 2003 was 33 million 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the impact that our contractual obligations as of december 31 2003 are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows 

  

    

we expect that our operating expenses will increase commensurate with an overall increase in the level of our business activity including increased sales and the related costs of products sold our consumer advertising campaign and dental professional marketing efforts continuing efforts to automate our manufacturing processes increases in the size of our sales force and dental professional training staff continued international sales and marketing efforts and development and improvements to our product in addition we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market sell and support our products on a worldwide basis we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we could be required to delay establishing a national brand building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology or to reduce our expenditures in general accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable legal contingencies and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin or sab no 104 revenue recognition and eitf 0021 sab no 104 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management’s judgments based on whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment eitf 0021 addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 

  

revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable the costs of producing the clincheck ™ treatment plan which are incurred prior to the production of aligners are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned ie upon shipment of the aligners 

  

in cases where the dental professional elects to finish the treatment plan using invisalign the dental professional orders case refinement from june 2001 through april 2003 we offered our dental professionals the opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount the advance purchase price was non 

  

refundable revenue in the amount of the standalone sales price of the undelivered element is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or case expiration in cases where the dental professional did not purchase case refinement in advance case refinement revenues are recognized when the new aligners are shipped 

  

in may 2003 we updated our domestic pricing policy to include the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of 125 each which we believe represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings revenue deferrals associated with future case refinement after may 1 2003 are 125 per case this revenue deferral amount represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with eitf 0021 which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services these revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been utilized or upon case expiration which ever is earliest 

  

service revenues earned for training of dental professionals and staff for invisalign are recorded as the services are performed service revenues earned under agreements with third parties are based on negotiated rates which are intended to approximate a markup on our anticipated costs 

  

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

  

warranty expense 

  

the company generally warrants its products for a specific period of time against material defects the company provides for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in costs of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized the accrued warranty costs represents the best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that the company expects to incur to repair or replace product which fails while still under warranty the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs on a quarterly basis the company reviews the accrued balances and updates the historical warranty cost trends actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 

  

aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed in the event the aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays for the additional expense the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign 

  

we accrue for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued our warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered defective or fail to meet the product specifications 

  

the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs is primarily based on our historical experience with product failures as well as current information on replacement costs actual warranty costs could differ from the estimate amounts on a quarterly basis we review the accrued balances and update the historical warranty cost trends if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future it would negatively affect operating results 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments we periodically review these estimated allowances including an analysis of the customers’ payment history and information regarding the customers’ creditworthiness if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments an additional allowance may be required and would negatively impact our operating results 

  

accounting for longlived assets 

  

we assess the impairment of longlived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in the stock price for a sustained period and the market capitalization relative to net book value if these factors or their related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record impairment charges which would negatively impact operating results 

  

legal contingencies 

  

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements because of uncertainties related to both the potential amount and range of loss from pending litigation management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an unfavorable outcome in these legal proceedings as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to this pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly revisions of our estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance 

  

we have established a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 

  

while we have considered potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas no 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 sfas no 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 the adoption of fas 149 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” sfas no 150 establishes standards for how companies classify and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity it requires companies to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances sfas no 150 is effective beginning second quarter of fiscal 2004 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 150 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

  

risk factors 

  

the statements contained below and elsewhere in this report on form 10k that are not purely historical are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 including without limitation statements regarding our expectations hopes beliefs anticipations commitments intentions and strategies regarding the future actual results could differ from those projected in any forwardlooking statements for the reasons among others detailed below the fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to our past filings means only that the risks are present in multiple periods we believe that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which we compete and will likely be present in all periods reported the fact that certain risks are characteristic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk the forwardlooking statements are made as of the date of this annual report on form 10k and we assume no obligation to update the forwardlooking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forwardlooking statements 

  

the operating losses and negative cash flows we have experienced in the past may continue throughout fiscal 2004 and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 

  

you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks expenses and difficulties encountered by a company in an early stage of operations since inception we have incurred significant operating losses and we have only achieved profitability during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 from inception through july 2000 we spent significant funds on organizational and startup activities recruiting key managers and employees developing invisalign and developing our manufacturing and customer support resources we also spent significant funds on clinical trials and training programs to train dental professionals in the use of invisalign 

  

we continue to incur significant operating expenses to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result we will need to increase our revenue significantly while controlling our expenses to achieve profitability only recently beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 have we generated positive cash flow from operations and we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase such positive cash flow from operations from period to period in the future it is possible that we will not achieve profitability in the future and even if we do achieve profitability in future periods we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in future periods 

  

we have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock price 

  

we were incorporated in april 1997 and began sales of invisalign in july 1999 thus we have a limited operating history which makes an evaluation of our future prospects and your investment in our stock difficult in addition we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we increase our commercial sales these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

  

   

   

   

   

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenue for a particular period falls below our expectations we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels 

  

due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

  

we have limited product offerings and if demand for invisalign declines or fails to develop as we expect our revenue will decline 

  

we expect that revenue from the sale of invisalign will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign is critical to our future success invisalign may not achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect or at all which could reduce our revenue and results of operations 

  

if dental professionals do not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate our operating results will be harmed 

  

our success depends upon increasing acceptance of invisalign by dental professionals invisalign requires dental professionals and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways in addition because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july 1997 and commercially available only since july 1999 dental professionals may be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available also increasing adoption and cumulative use by dental professionals will depend on factors such as the capability safety efficacy ease of use price quality and reliability of our products and our provision of effective sales support training and service in the future unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and consequently reduced acceptance by dental professionals if invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and dental communities our operating results will be harmed 

  

if consumers do not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate our operating results will be harmed 

  

invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and patients may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment in addition patients may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for invisalign which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment we have generally received positive feedback from both dental professionals and patients regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients our success will depend upon the acceptance of invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental professionals and potential patients to whom we are now actively marketing we have had a limited number of complaints from patients and prospective patients generally related to shipping delays and minor manufacturing irregularities market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well 

  

as other factors including effectiveness safety reliability improved treatment aesthetics and greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products furthermore consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience adoption by consumers may also be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions including the economic downturn and increased unemployment levels in the united states of america levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending all of which fluctuate and could be affected by unstable global economic political or other conditions if orthodontists and dentists experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services or consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate our operating results will be harmed 

  

we are dependent on our international manufacturing operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

  

currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of our clincheck ™ product and are used to manufacture aligner molds a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners and ships the completed products to our customers our costs associated with these operations are denominated in costa rican colons mexican pesos and us dollars 

  

our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if any of these risks materialize in the future our operating results may be harmed 

  

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed 

  

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2003 we had 41 issued us patents 73 pending us patent applications and numerous foreign issued patents as well as pending foreign patent applications 

  

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently 

  

pending or future patent filings may not issue as patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect pricing and market share 

  

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business will be severely limited 

  

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of another party’s patent in the past and while that action has been dismissed we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 

  

on january 6 2003 ormco corporation filed suit against us in the united states district court for the central district orange county division asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 5683243 and 6244861 the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief on february 18 2003 we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of the asserted patents in addition we counterclaimed for infringement of our us patent no 6398548 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on march 10 2003 and asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6398548 we responded to ormco’s counterclaims on april 2 2003 we amended our counterclaim to add allesee orthodontic appliances inc “aoa” a whollyowned subsidiary of ormco as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of us patent no 6398548 the court then permitted ormco to amend its complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional patent each ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of us patent no 6616444 on october 15 2003 on october 27 2003 we filed an answer to ormco’s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6616444 and for infringement of us patent no 6554611 

  

at a scheduling conference held on november 24 2003 the court set a june 10 2004 discovery cutoff and an october 2004 trial date 

  

three years ago ormco filed suit against us asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 in june 2000 the parties entered into a stipulation of dismissal with ormco ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation with respect to these patents except as set forth below further ormco agreed that it would not bring any patent action against us for at least a period of one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents if ormco were to bring such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year the stipulation of dismissal would allow ormco to include in such an action claims involving us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 in august 2001 ormco notified us of the issuance of us patent no 6244861 and offered a license for this patent we did not take a license to this patent five months after ormco’s notification it filed the lawsuit that is currently pending 

  

the claims in us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 relate to methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances the relevant claims are limited to computerized methods and 

  

algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient the claims in us patent nos 6244861 and 6616444 are more generic claims relating to the methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances based on the disclosure in the patent however the relevant claims also appear to be limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient the treatment plan simulation developed in our facilities determines the final positioning of a patient’s teeth but is not based on a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient 

  

the claims in our us patent nos 6398548 and 6554611 relate to methods and systems for incrementally moving teeth using a series of appliances designed to be placed successively on the patient’s teeth 

  

we strongly believe that ormco’s claims of infringement lack merit and that our counterclaim of infringement will be successful however the outcome of a lawsuit is inherently unpredictable should our technology be found to infringe any one of ormco’s asserted patents we would have to seek a license from ormco which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in that event we could be subject to damages or an injunction which could materially adversely affect our business 

  

from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in a patent suit by ormco or in any other litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

  

pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 

  

we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or in cases where injunctive relief is sought an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods 

  

we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process and if our access to these inputs is diminished our business may be harmed 

  

we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process we rely on a third party manufacturer in mexico to fabricate aligners and to ship the completed product to customers as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed this third party manufacturer was recently acquired by a larger company in its industry any difficulties encountered by the acquiring company with respect to assimilating personnel and operations and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards controls procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible 

  

in addition we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of delivery delays or shortages of these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

  

we have experienced rapid growth and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business 

  

we have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in 1999 our headcount increased from approximately 50 employees as of september 30 1999 to approximately 741 employees as of december 31 2003 this expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the us and internationally in particular rapid growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas including recruiting and retaining sufficient skilled personnel providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards and preserving our culture and values our inability to effectively manage this level of growth could harm our business 

  

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

  

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering technology development and management teams the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel in addition few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

  

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition in the future 

  

currently our invisalign product competes directly against a product called red white and blue which is manufactured and distributed by ormco a subsidiary of sybron dental specialties in addition manufacturers of traditional braces such as 3m company sybron dental specialties and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by our competitors our business could be harmed 

  

we may be unable to raise additional capital if it should be necessary which could harm our ability to compete 

  

we have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have achieved profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as of december 31 2003 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 3006 million 

  

we expect to expend significant capital to continue to build our national brand expand our dental professional channels automate our manufacturing processes and develop both product and process technology in november 2002 we completed a private placement of common stock to a group of investors led by existing stockholders raising 181 million net of issuance costs in december 2002 we secured an accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit of up to 100 million and in december 2003 negotiated more favorable terms and increased the line of credit up to 15 million in december 2002 we also secured an equipmentbased term loan of 50 million which was fully drawn down in december 2002 as of december 31 2003 we had not utilized the accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit accessing the accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and compliance with customary loan covenants there can be no assurance that such financing will be adequate for us to avoid reducing operating expenses by among other things reducing planned capital expenditures relating to enhancing our manufacturing process and reducing worldwide staff 

  

complying with the food and drug administration fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

  

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action which may include recalling products ceasing product marketing and paying significant fines and penalties one or more of these enforcement actions could limit product sales delay product shipment and adversely affect our profitability 

  

we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections which we have yet to undergo if we or any third party manufacturer of our products do not conform to applicable quality system regulations we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process 

  

before we can sell a new medical device in the us we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda through the premarket notification provisions of section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act we may be unable to maintain the necessary clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

  

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

  

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or 

  

similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

  

if compliance with government regulations of healthcare becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

  

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our healthcare service provider payor and plan customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

  

the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa may require us to make unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the affect of hipaa on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

  

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

  

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

  

   

   

   

complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

  

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

  

sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all we currently sell our products in europe canada the united kingdom mexico brazil australia and hong kong and may expand into other countries from time to time we do not know whether orthodontists dentists and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

  

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

  

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

  

in fiscal 2003 the market price for our common stock was highly volatile although the market price for our common stock has increased during fiscal 2003 the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control 

  

the factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future we would incur substantial legal fees and our management’s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

  

future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 

  

a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders these stockholders have sold in the past and may sell in the future large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business in addition certain of our current stockholders have registration rights in connection with a private placement sale of approximately 96 million shares of our common stock that occurred in november 2002 as a result of these registration rights we were required to file a registration statement under the securities act at our expense to register the securities sold in the november 2002 private placement we filed this registration statement with the sec on october 17 2003 and it was declared effective by the sec on november 20 2003 our stock price could fluctuate significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them these sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell securities in the future at a time and at a price we deem appropriate 

  

concentrations of ownership and agreements among our existing executive officers directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate transactions 

  

the interests of our management could conflict with those of our other stockholders as of december 31 2003 our executive officers directors and principal stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 507 of our outstanding common stock these stockholders if acting together would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us which in turn could reduce the market price of our stock 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative disclosures 

  

we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 

  

interest rate risk  we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents availableforsale marketable securities existing longterm debts and any future financing requirements interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by monitoring maturities in our marketable securities portfolio our longterm debt at december 31 2003 consists of outstanding balances on capital lease obligations of 05 million and a 33 million equipmentbased term loan 

  

the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities do not exceed fiscal year 2004 and the interest rates are primarily fixed our capital lease obligations of 05 million at december 31 2003 carry fixed interest rates of 653 and 1115 per annum with principal payments due in 60 and 48 monthly installments respectively which began in 2000 

  

in december 2002 we obtained a 50 million equipmentbased term loan which accrues interest at a rate of 225 above prime in december 2002 we had drawn down 50 million from the equipmentbased term loan principal payments are due in 36 monthly installments which began in january 2003 

  

the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amounts and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and longterm debt instruments 

  

   

qualitative disclosures 

  

interest rate risk  our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to 

  

   

   

   

we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity as a result we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and longterm marketable securities portfolio 

  

we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding longterm debts through the use of fixed rate debt management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis 

  

currency rate risk  our primary currency rate risk exposures relate to 

  

   

we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures or intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates the exposure related to currency rate movements would not likely have a material impact on future net income or cash flows for the foreseeable future

 item 1 business 

  

overview 

  

since the inception of align technology inc align in april 1997 we have been engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of invisalign a proprietary system for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth in july 1999 we commenced commercial sales of invisalign prior to july 1999 we devoted nearly all our resources to developing our software and manufacturing processes performing clinical trials of invisalign and building our sales force customer support and management teams we exited the development stage in july 2000 

  

invisalign has two components clincheck ™ and aligners clincheck ™ is an internetbased application that allows dental professionals to simulate treatment in three dimensions by modeling twoweek stages of tooth movement aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck ™ simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck ™  

  

currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of our clincheck ™ product and are used to manufacture aligner molds a third party contract manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners and ships the completed products to our customers our costs associated with these operations are denominated in costa rican colons mexican pesos and us dollars 

  

in july 2002 we announced a plan to streamline worldwide operations the plan included closing our facility in pakistan and the united arab emirates or the uae we transitioned the operations performed at these facilities to the united states and costa rica for the period ending december 31 2002 we recorded severance charges of 23 million facility closure charges of 09 million a loss on disposal of fixed assets of 11 million and an impairment charge of 09 million related to the land in pakistan the land was written down to a zero value to reflect its fair value as estimated by management approximately 01 million of accrued charges related to professional fees were included in accrued liabilities as of december 31 2002 we discontinued operations at our facilities in pakistan and the uae in october and december 2002 respectively we concluded the remainder of indirect operational activities related to the costa rica transition in january 2003 we will cease nonoperational closing activities in pakistan when the land is disposed of at that location and in the uae when the necessary statutory filings have been completed 

  

revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment provided no significant obligations remain transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivables is deemed 

  

probable the costs of producing the clincheck ™ treatment plan which are incurred prior to the production of aligners are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned ie upon shipment of the aligners we offer our dental professionals an opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount the advance purchase price is nonrefundable once aligners are shipped and the related revenue is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or case expiration in cases where the dental professional does not purchase the case refinements in advance case refinement revenues are recognized when the new aligners are shipped 

  

service revenues earned under agreements with third parties for training of dental professionals and staff for invisalign are recorded as the services are performed charges to third parties are based on negotiated rates that are intended to approximate a markup on our anticipated costs 

  

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur 

  

industry background 

  

malocclusion 

  

malocclusion is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions affecting over 200 million individuals or approximately 75 of the us population approximately two million people annually elect orthodontic treatment in the us generating industry revenues of approximately 7 billion while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional treatment 

  

traditional orthodontic treatment 

  

currently dental professionals apply traditional techniques and principles of orthodontic treatment developed in the early 20th century in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally in an attempt to improve treatment aesthetics dental professionals use ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patient’s teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices 

  

the average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patient’s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient’s teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient’s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement because of the length of time between visits the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient’s teeth 

  

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us 3000 to 5000 and generally only a portion of the fees are reimbursed by insurance if covered at all in addition dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional’s estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professional’s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time or reduced profitability for the dental professional 

  

  

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment 

  

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability 

  

the align solution 

  

invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion invisalign consists of two components clincheck ™ and aligners 

  

clincheck ™  clincheck ™ is an interactive internet application that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatment for their patients we use a dental impression and a treatment prescription submitted by a dental professional to develop a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments clincheck ™ allows the dental professional to view this three dimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly clincheck ™ enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible 

  

  

upon review of the clincheck ™ simulation the dental professional may immediately approve the projected treatment or may provide us with feedback for modification we reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation upon the dental professional’s approval of the clincheck ™ simulation we use the data underlying the simulation to manufacture the patient’s aligners 

  

aligners  aligners are custommanufactured clear removable dental appliances that when worn in a prescribed series provide orthodontic treatment each aligner covers a patient’s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck ™ treatment simulation after two weeks of use the patient discards the aligners and replaces them with the next pair in the series this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion have the patient use the last aligner as a temporary retainer or go directly to a conventional retainer 

  

benefits of invisalign 

  

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to patients and dental professionals that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces 

  

benefits to the patient 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of conventional braces 

  

benefits to the dental professional 

  

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

we believe the combination of increased patient volume reduced chair time and increased practice productivity has the potential to improve orthodontic practice profitability 

  

limitations of invisalign 

  

in some instances invisalign may have certain limitations relative to conventional treatment aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in conventional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional the cost of invisalign to the patient may be greater than for conventional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there is generally a turnaround time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal results in addition because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech we believe that these limitations are outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 

  

our target market 

  

commercial sales of invisalign commenced in the us in july 1999 as of december 31 2002 approximately 80000 patients worldwide had entered treatment using invisalign 

  

medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness class i or ii devices require the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification to the food and drug administration or the fda requesting permission for commercial distribution which is known as 510k clearance we obtained our 510k clearance in september 1998 our 510k clearance allows us to market invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion we voluntarily restrict the use of invisalign to adults and adolescents with mature dentition individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially complete jaw growth this group represents approximately 160 million people in the us typically girls by the age of 13 years and boys by the age of 16 years will have developed mature 

  

dentition currently we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing as the effectiveness of invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment based on our clinical studies to date we recommend that dental professionals use invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for severe malocclusions 

  

approximately two million patients enter into traditional orthodontic treatment in the us annually these patients represent approximately one percent of the population of people with malocclusion of these over 50 or more than one million patients have mature dentition and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign 

  

in addition we believe that we have an immediate and substantial market expansion opportunity our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces persons with malocclusion will be more likely to seek treatment we believe that adults who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment represent our most significant market expansion opportunity 

  

in each of fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 no single customer accounted for 10 or more of our total revenues 

  

we continue to focus on the domestic market opportunity and on selected international markets 

  

business strategy 

  

our objective is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic malocclusion key elements of our strategy include the following 

  

educate dental professionals and stimulate demand for invisalign treatment  our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually we advertise nationally using a broad marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of applicability of invisalign in october 2001 we expanded our training of dental professionals in our domestic market to include general practitioner dentists as of december 31 2002 we had trained over 18000 dental professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of invisalign 

  

communicate practice benefits of invisalign to dental professionals  invisalign provides substantial financial incentives to dental professionals by enabling them to increase patient volume charge a premium price and reduce chair time per treatment we intend to continue to emphasize these practice benefits to dental professionals through our sales and training efforts 

  

expand and enhance manufacturing capability  our manufacturing operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom aligners at a high level of quality to improve cost efficiency we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively lowwage countries we intend to maintain manufacturing capacity in excess of projected demand to reduce the risk that manufacturing capacity may place on our ability to grow our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process by continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes we plan to increase the level of production automation increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both unit costs and production times 

  

extend and defend technology leadership  invisalign represents a significant technological advancement in orthodontics we believe that our issued patents multiple pending patents and other intellectual property provide us with a substantial lead over potential competitors one of our issued us patents is written broadly to cover any algorithmic method of segmenting orthodontic treatment into a sequence of three or more steps based on calculated initial and final digital representations of a patient’s dentition we continue to pursue further 

  

intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 

  

expand our target patient base  invisalign can provide complete treatment for patients with mature dentition and a broad range of malocclusion in addition we believe that invisalign can provide partial treatment of severe malocclusion in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s ability to comprehensively treat such cases we initiated the publication of a series of clinical case studies and articles that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional improvements to the product 

  

build an international presence  while we focus primarily on the domestic market we continue to introduce invisalign in selected international markets on a limited basis 

  

manufacturing 

  

we produce highly customized highly precise medical quality products in volume to do so we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions computed tomography known as ct scanning stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 

  

we believe the complexity inherent in producing such highly customized devices in high volumes is a barrier to potential competitors furthermore we believe the sophisticated software we use to guide a custom manufacturing process on a high volume was not available until we developed it we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 

  

manufacturing is coordinated in santa clara california as of december 31 2002 we employed a manufacturing staff in the us and costa rica of approximately 340 people in addition in the us we employed a software development team comprised of approximately 26 software engineers with experience in computational geometry animation computeraided design and various manufacturing industries we also contracted with approximately 20 software engineers in pakistan and russia who were part of the team responsible for the creation of treatment simulation software the operations team in costa rica creates treatment simulations using clincheck ™  we outsource the fabrication and packaging of aligners to a contract manufacturer based in juarez mexico 

  

the invisalign treatment process 

  

the invisalign treatment process comprises the following five stages 

  

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us  in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinylsiloxane or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches xrays of the patient’s dentition photographs of the patient a wax bite depicting the relationship between the patient’s upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form or prescription the impression is a critical component of invisalign as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patient’s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patient’s teeth the prescription is also a critical component of invisalign describing the desired positions and movement of the patient’s teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our santa clara facility 

  

  

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition using ct scanning we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patient’s current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional’s prescription electronically to our facilities in costa rica 

  

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck ™  in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon passing review the simulation is then delivered to the prescribing dental professional via clincheck ™  which is available on our website at wwwinvisaligncom and wwwaligntechcom the dental professional then reviews the clincheck ™ simulation and on occasion asks us to make adjustments by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to review clincheck ™  allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professional then approves the proposed treatment and in doing so engages us for the manufacture of corresponding aligners 

  

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment  we use the approved clincheck ™ simulation to construct a series of molds of the patient’s teeth each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment these molds are fabricated at our santa clara california manufacturing facility using custom manufacturing techniques including stereolithography that we have adapted for use in orthodontic applications 

  

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional  from these molds our contract manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners by pressureforming polymeric sheets over each mold the aligners are then trimmed polished cleaned and packaged following final inspection the aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental professional we ship all of the aligners in a single batch in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with clear attachments bonded to the patient’s teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement 

  

in certain cases we provide an alignerlike template to the dental professionals to aide the placement of bonding attachments to the patient’s teeth these attachments are used to optimize the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movements also in cases where intraproximal reduction or idr is requested by the dental professional we provide an idr prescription form quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction location and timing of idr 

  

throughput management 

  

because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we do not build inventories as a result we must conservatively build manufacturing throughput for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

  

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks we continue to upgrade our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication of aligners currently conducted in mexico in order to scale our manufacturing capacity we continue to invest in facilities and capital equipment 

  

  

quality assurance 

  

our quality assurance system is compliant with fda medical device regulations 21cfr part 820 and we are iso 90011994 certified an internationally recognized quality system our system defines processes and procedures to ensure product and service quality and includes methods to monitor levels of quality based on internal data and direct customer feedback we utilize this data to continuously improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as required 

  

since we custom manufacture aligners on a buildtoorder basis we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck ™ and each aligner is unique we inspect 100 of the product at various points in the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers’ expectations aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case in completed in the event the aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners 

  

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign however if actual treatment results deviate significantly from the approved clincheck ™ treatment plan the dental professional may request a midcourse correction under the invisalign product warranty these deviations have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth a midcourse correction requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient’s dentition to us we use the impressions to create a new clincheck ™ treatment plan for the dental professional to approve from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 

  

in the event that a dental professional wishes to effect additional adjustments to a patient’s treatment when the actual treatment results are in accordance with the approved clincheck ™ treatment plan the dental professional may request a case refinement or additional aligners however in these cases the case refinement and additional aligners are provided at the dental professional’s expense in addition should a dental professional request a replacement for a lost aligner we charge the dental professional for the cost of the replacement aligner 

  

sales and marketing 

  

we market invisalign by communicating invisalign’s benefits directly to consumers and dental professionals with a nationwide advertising campaign based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales in our test markets we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign in order to serve anticipated worldwide demand we are training a broad base of dental professionals 

  

consumer marketing 

  

our national consumer marketing efforts primarily focus on television advertising and are supported by print public relations and direct mail campaigns we advertise nationally using a broad marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand 

  

our experience indicates that prospective patients exposed to our advertising seek information from four primary sources 

  

   

   

  

   

   

our marketing efforts have generated substantial consumer interest directed toward our telephone support line and our website our telephone support line and our website not only provide consumers with information on invisalign but importantly also allow us to channel consumer interest to dental professionals we have outsourced the telephone support function to a national call center operator 

  

professional marketing 

  

professional marketing consists of training dental professionals and assisting them in building their practices as of december 31 2002 our domestic sales team consisted of 32 salespeople supporting the orthodontic market and 2 area managers and 17 contract salespeople supporting the general practitioner dentist market our international sales team consisted of 33 salespeople supporting the orthodontic market and the general practitioner dentist market approximately 30 customer support staff together with the marketing department and our inhouse orthodontic staff support the domestic sales team our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july 1999 in 2001 we began marketing invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market we provide training certification marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in the us and canada which we consider our domestic market and internationally 

  

as of december 31 2002 we had trained over 18000 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those dental professionals trained approximately 67 are dental professionals in our domestic market within our domestic market we have trained approximately 7000 orthodontists representing approximately 80 of all practicing orthodontists in the us and canada and approximately 5300 general practitioner dentists as of december 31 2002 approximately 8500 of the worldwide dental professionals we have trained had submitted one or more cases to us and over 80000 patients have commenced treatment with invisalign our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign prescription form clinical tips and techniques guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck ™ software and the many other features of our website 

  

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment and we present our training material in a manner consistent with dental professionals’ training and experience our success in training a large number of dental professionals confirms our belief that training represents a minimal barrier to adoption for most dental professionals 

  

after training sales representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases such follow up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions establishing an internet connection and familiarizing them with our website sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

  

general practitioner dentists play an important role in informing their patients about orthodontics and are a key source of both referrals to orthodontists and invisalign case submissions there are over 120000 active general practice dentists in the us and canada 

  

  

research and development 

  

as of december 31 2002 our research and development team consisted of 15 individuals with medical device development orthodontic and other relevant backgrounds in addition we employed a software development team comprised of approximately 26 software engineers in the us with experience in computational geometry animation computeraided design and various manufacturing industries we also contracted with approximately 20 software engineers in pakistan and russia who were part of the team responsible for the creation of treatment simulation software prior to commercial launch in july 1999 our research and development strategy had three primary objectives developing invisalign establishing the ability of invisalign to treat malocclusion and developing software and processes to enable the manufacture of aligners in volume since our commercial launch our research and development effort has focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our line of products our research and development expenses were 131 million 156 million and 94 million in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

in an effort to demonstrate invisalign’s broad treatment capabilities we initiated the publication of a series of clinical case studies and articles that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases including those of severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process our product development team is testing enhanced materials and a number of complementary products that we expect will provide additional revenue opportunities 

  

in fiscal 2002 we continued to enhance our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software primarily to increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency 

  

intellectual property 

  

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2002 we had 29 issued us patents 20 issued foreign patents 69 pending us patent applications and numerous pending foreign patent applications 

  

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products 

  

competition 

  

we compete directly with companies such as ormco orthodontics a wholly owned subsidiary of sybron dental specialties which manufactures and distributes a product called red white  blue a product that is similar in use to invisalign but different in features manufacturing process and delivery we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of other orthodontic products these manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances include 3m company ormco orthodontics and dentsply international inc 

  

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors 

  

government regulation 

  

fda regulation of medical devices  invisalign is regulated as a medical device accordingly our product development labeling manufacturing processes and promotional activities are subject to extensive review and rigorous regulation by government agencies in those countries in which we sell our products 

  

in the us the fda regulates the design manufacture distribution preclinical and clinical study clearance and approval of medical devices medical devices are classified in one of three classes on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness class i or ii devices require the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution which is known as 510k clearance class iii devices which are deemed by the fda to pose greater risk than class i and ii devices require fda approval of a premarket approval application which includes among other things extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and information about the devices and components’ design manufacturing and labeling 

  

invisalign is a class i device the least stringent class which only requires general controls including labeling premarket notification and adherence to the fda’s quality system regulations in addition because invisalign is a class i device we are required to register contract manufacturers located outside the us with the fda accordingly we have registered elamex our mexicobased contract manufacturer with the fda elamex is certified under iso an internationally recognized quality standard and also performs subcontractor manufacturing for other usbased medical device companies our quality system and procedures are set up to comply with all fda regulations elamex has dedicated an area in its facilities and certain personnel for our exclusive use we have supplied elamex with procedures to manufacture and ship our products and have trained elamex’s personnel thus ensuring compliance with fda regulations as long as the procedures are followed we conduct frequent visits to the mexico facility to monitor elamex’s performance and its compliance with our procedures 

  

in november 1998 invisalign received 510k premarket notification by the fda allowing us to market invisalign in the us the manufacture and distribution of invisalign are subject to continuing regulation by the fda we are subject to routine inspections by the fda to determine compliance with facility registration product listing requirements medical device reporting regulations and quality system requirements the quality system regulation is similar to good manufacturing practices and relates to product testing and quality assurance as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 

  

if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of 510k premarket notification clearances already granted and criminal prosecution 

  

in europe invisalign is regulated as a custom device as such we are not subject to regulations promulgated by the european union although we have the option to ce mark our product we are iso 90011994 certified which facilitates the commercialization of invisalign outside the us 

  

health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative 

  

simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information referred to as the privacy standard and other state laws and regulations the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information although compliance is principally the responsibility of the hospital physician or other healthcare provider our agreements with orthodontists and other healthcare professionals require that we comply with the privacy standard when providing technical services and when handling patient information and records we have designed our product and service offerings to enable compliance with hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in our systems and services additionally our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements and the privacy standard 

  

other federal and state laws  as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

  

laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions of the social security act prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and similar other federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers finally various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service for dentists and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 608 employees approximately 282 of whom were employed in the us 251 in costa rica 46 in europe 12 in latin america 10 in asiapacific and 7 in the uae as of december 31 2002 of our us employees approximately 91 were employed in manufacturing 67 were employed in various management administrative and support positions 49 were marketing and customer support staff 34 were sales representatives 26 were software engineers and 15 were employed in research and development 

  

web site postings 

  

we make our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k and amendments to such reports available free of charge through our web site as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the united states securities and exchange commission at the following addresses wwwaligntechcom and wwwinvisaligncom the information in or that can be accessed through our web site is not part of this report 

  

  










 item 2 properties 

  

our headquarters are located in santa clara california we lease approximately 90000 square feet of space where we house our manufacturing customer support software engineering and administrative personnel we lease our santa clara facilities under two leases both of which expire at the end of 2005 the combined monthly rent for the santa clara facilities is approximately 270000 

  

we also operate a facility in san jose costa rica the main facility comprises approximately 25000 square feet of manufacturing and office space the monthly rent for the costa rica facility is approximately 14000 the lease for this facility expires at the end of 2006 

  

we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in january 2003 ormco corporation filed suit against align technology inc in the united states district court for the central district orange county division asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 5683243 and 6244861 the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief in february 2003 align answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of the asserted patents in addition align counterclaimed for infringement of its us patent no 6398548 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief ormco filed a reply to align’s counterclaims on march 10 2003 and asserted counterclaims against align seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6 398 548 align’s response to ormco’s counterclaims is due in early april 2003 no trial or other dates have yet been set by the court 

  

three years ago ormco filed suit against align asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 in june 2000 the parties entered into a stipulation of dismissal with ormco ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation with respect to these patents except as set forth below further ormco agreed that it would not bring any patent action against align for at least a period of one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents if ormco were to bring such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year the stipulation of dismissal would allow ormco to include in such an action claims involving us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 in august 2001 ormco notified align of the issuance of us patent no 6244861 and offered a license for this patent align did not take a license to this patent five months after ormco’s notification it filed the lawsuit that is currently pending 

  

the claims in us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 relate to methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances the relevant claims are limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient the claims in us patent no 6244861 are more generic claims relating to the methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances based on the disclosure in the patent however the relevant claims also appear to be limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient the treatment plan simulation developed in align’s facilities determines the final positioning of a patient’s teeth but is not based on a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient 

  

the claims in align’s us patent no 6398548 relate to methods and systems for incrementally moving teeth using a series of appliances designed to be placed successively on the patient’s teeth 

  

align strongly believes that ormco’s claims of infringement lack merit and that align’s counterclaim of infringement will be successful however the outcome of a lawsuit is inherently unpredictable should align’s technology be found to infringe any one of ormco’s asserted patents align would have to seek a license from 

  

ormco which license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in that event align could be subject to damages or an injunction which could materially adversely affect its business 

  

on may 1 2002 gw com inc filed a complaint in santa clara superior court against us and james lindsey the owner of the premises located at 851 martin avenue santa clara california we were parties with gw com to a subsublease for such premises the term of which expired on august 14 2002 in early 2001 we engaged in negotiations with gw com to amend the subsublease to add additional space and to extend the term through november 30 2004 the proposed amendment however required the consent of the owner of the subject property mr lindsey we withdrew from the negotiations of the amendment after among other things mr lindsey’s consent could not be obtained gw com’s complaint alleged breach of contract against us and breach of contract and intentional interference with contract against mr lindsey in the complaint gw com sought damages of more than 4 million in february 2002 we entered into a written settlement agreement pursuant to which gw com paid us an aggregate of 188000 and mr lindsey paid us an aggregate of 10000 

  

on april 9 2002 we exercised our right to terminate an exclusive marketing agreement dated october 18 2001 with discus dental impressions inc pursuant to the express terms of the agreement and we issued a press release reporting this termination on or about may 14 2002 we received a demand for arbitration submitted by discus dental with the american arbitration association in san jose california in its arbitration demand discus dental seeks damages of approximately 30 million including commissions and bonus payments it claims it would have received under the agreement as well as other expenses attorneys’ fees and injunctive relief to prevent us from selling invisalign to dentists in the us and canada however prior to terminating the agreement we conducted a thorough review of the agreement and each party’s performance thereunder based upon that review of the factual and legal issues we deny all claims made by discus dental in its demand and contend that such claims are entirely without merit in addition on or about june 13 2002 we submitted a counterclaim against discus dental in the arbitration seeking damages of approximately 40 million arising out of our claims for misrepresentation breach of confidentiality provisions and unfair competition among others the three arbitrators have been selected and the parties are exchanging and reviewing documents in response to document demands the matter is currently set for arbitration on august 18 2003 

  

in february 2001 align technology was named in a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of all licensed dentists excluding orthodontists in the us the complaint alleged that align technology’s policy of selling invisalign exclusively to orthodontists violated the us antitrust laws without admitting any wrongdoing the company entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit the total legal and other settlement costs that align has agreed to pay are approximately 400000 in legal fees in november 2001 the court approved the stipulation and agreement of settlement pursuant to the settlement we trained and certified approximately 5000 in fiscal 2002 and have undertaken to certify 5000 general practitioner dentists each year over the next three years 

  

from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

overview 

  

since our inception in april 1997 we have been engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of invisalign a proprietary system for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth 

  

invisalign has two components clincheck ™ and aligners clincheck ™ is an internetbased application that allows dental professionals to simulate treatment in three dimensions by modeling twoweek stages of tooth movement aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck ™ simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck ™  

  

currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of our clincheck ™ product and are used to manufacture aligner molds a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners and ships the completed products to our customers 

  

in july 2002 we announced a plan to streamline worldwide operations the plan included closing our facilities in pakistan and the uae we transitioned the operations performed at these facilities to the united states and costa rica for the period ending december 31 2002 we recorded severance charges of 23 million facility closure charges of 09 million a loss on disposal of fixed assets of 11 million and an impairment charge of 09 million related to the land in pakistan the land was written down to a zero value to reflect its fair value as estimated by management approximately 01 million of accrued charges related to professional fees were included in accrued liabilities as of december 31 2002 we discontinued operations at our facilities in pakistan and the uae in october and december 2002 respectively we concluded the remainder of indirect operational activities related to the costa rica transition in january 2003 we will cease nonoperational closing activities in pakistan when the land is disposed of at that location and in the uae when the necessary statutory filings have been completed 

  

revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment provided no significant obligations remain transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivables is deemed probable the costs of producing the clincheck ™ treatment plan which are incurred prior to the production of 

  

aligners are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned ie upon shipment of the aligners we offer our dental professionals an opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount the advance purchase price is nonrefundable once aligners are shipped and is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or case expiration in cases where the dental professional does not purchase the case refinements in advance case refinement revenues are recognized when the new aligners are shipped 

  

service revenues earned under agreements with third parties for training of dental professionals and staff for invisalign are recorded as the services are performed charges to third parties are based on negotiated rates which are intended to approximate a markup on our anticipated costs 

  

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur 

  

we have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have not yet achieved profitability as of december 31 2002 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 2742 million 

  

we expect to expend significant capital to continue to build our national brand expand our dental professional channel automate our manufacturing processes and develop both product and process technology in november 2002 we completed a private placement of common stock to a group of investors led by existing shareholders raising 181 million net of issuance costs in december 2002 we secured an accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit of up to 10 million and an equipmentbased term loan of 5 million which was accessed in december 2002 as of december 31 2002 and march 18 2003 we had not utilized the accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit accessing the accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and compliance with certain loan covenants however there can be no assurance that such financing will be adequate for us to avoid reducing operating expenses by including but not limited to reducing planned capital expenditures relating to enhancing our manufacturing process and reducing worldwide staff

liquidity and capital resources 

  

historically we have funded our operations with the proceeds from the sale of our common and preferred stock equipment leases and bridge loans as of december 31 2002 we had 356 million of cash and cash equivalents marketable securities of 27 million and an accumulated deficit of 2742 million in addition we had 33 million of restricted cash 

  

net cash used in operating activities totaled 404 million and 779 million for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively in each of these periods net cash used by operating activities consisted primarily of operating losses and increases in accounts receivable balances partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization and amortization of deferred stockbased compensation 

  

net cash provided by investing activities totaled 15 million for the year ended december 31 2002 and net cash used in investing activities totaled 20 million for the year ended december 31 2001 for the year ended december 31 2002 net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of maturities of marketable securities which was partially offset by purchases of property and equipment for the year ended december 31 2001 net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities and a decrease in restricted cash partially offset by purchases of marketable securities and purchases of property and equipment

we expect that our operating expenses will increase with an overall increase in the level of our business activity including increased sales and the related costs of products sold our consumer advertising campaign and dental professional marketing efforts continuing efforts to automate our manufacturing processes increases in the size of our sales force and dental professional training staff continued international sales and marketing efforts and development and improvements to our product in addition we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market sell and support our products on a worldwide basis we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investment balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we could be required to delay establishing a national brand building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology or to reduce our expenditures in general accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to revenue recognition accounts receivable legal contingencies and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates 

  

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment provided no significant obligations remain transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivables is deemed 

  

probable the costs of producing the clincheck ™ treatment plan which are incurred prior to the production of aligners are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned ie upon shipment of the aligners align offers its dental professionals an opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount the advance purchase price is nonrefundable once aligners are shipped and is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or case expiration in cases where the dental professional does not purchase the case refinements in advance case refinement revenues are recognized when the new aligners are shipped 

  

revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment provided no significant obligations remain transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivables is deemed probable beginning july 2002 clincheck ™ fees are no longer received upfront but are billed together with the aligner fees at the time the aligners are shipped and are recognized at that time we offer our dental professionals an opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount the advance purchase price is nonrefundable once aligners are shipped and are deferred until either upon shipment of the case refinement or upon case expiration in cases where the dental professional does not purchase the case refinements in advance case refinement revenues are recognized when the new aligners are shipped the costs of producing the clincheck ™ treatment plan which are incurred prior to the production of aligners are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned ancillary product sales and services consist primarily of training 

  

service revenues earned under agreements with third parties for training of dental professionals and staff for invisalign are recorded as the services are performed charges to third parties are based on negotiated rates which are intended to approximate a markup on our anticipated costs 

  

we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales if any in the period such sales occur 

  

warranty expense 

  

we accrue for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued our warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered defective or fail to meet the product specifications provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments we periodically review these estimated allowances including an analysis of the customers’ payment history and information regarding the customers’ creditworthiness known to us if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments an additional allowance may be required 

  

accounting for longlived assets 

  

we assess the impairment of longlived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business significant negative industry or economic trends a significant decline in the stock price for a sustained period and the market capitalization relative to net book value 

  

  

legal contingencies 

  

we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note 5 of our consolidated financial statements because of uncertainties related to both the potential amount and range of loss from pending litigation management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an unfavorable outcome in these legal proceedings as additional information becomes available we will assess the potential liability related to this pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly revisions of our estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 

  

deferred tax valuation allowance 

  

we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in april 2002 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 145 “rescission of fasb statement no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections” “sfas no 145” which eliminates inconsistencies between the required accounting for saleleaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to saleleaseback transactions sfas no 145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections clarify meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions the provisions of sfas no 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning after may 15 2002 and for transactions occurring after may 15 2002 align does not expect sfas no 145 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or on its consolidated results of operations 

  

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for exit or disposal activities” “sfas no 146” which addresses the recognition measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the eitf has set forth in eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” sfas no 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 the adoption of sfas no 146 did not have a material impact on align’s consolidated financial statements 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 45 “fin 45” “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor’s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee in addition fin 45 requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued including a reconciliation of changes in the entity’s product warranty liabilities the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 irrespective of the guarantor’s fiscal yearend the disclosure requirements of fin 45 are effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december 15 2002 in accordance with the provisions of fin 45 align has adopted the disclosure requirements the adoption of fin 45 did not have a material impact on align’s consolidated financial position and its consolidated statements of operations 

  

in november 2002 the emerging issues task force “eitf” reached consensus on eitf 0021 “accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables” which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products services andor rights to use assets the final consensus of eitf 0021 will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2003 with early adoption permitted additionally companies will be permitted to apply 

  

the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” align is currently evaluating the impact of eitf 0021 on its consolidated financial position and its consolidated results of operations 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 123” sfas no 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation sfas no 148 also requires prominent disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in both annual and interim financial statements the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 148 are effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2002 the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december 15 2002 in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 148 align has adopted the disclosure requirements the adoption of sfas no 148 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or on its consolidated results of operations

risk factors 

  

the statements contained below and elsewhere in this report on form 10k that are not purely historical are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 including without limitation statements regarding our expectations hopes beliefs anticipations commitments intentions and strategies regarding the future actual results could differ from those projected in any forwardlooking statements for the reasons among others detailed below the fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to our past filings means only that the risks are present in multiple periods we believe that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which we compete and will likely be present in all periods reported the fact that certain risks are characteristic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk the forwardlooking statements are made as of the date of this annual report on form 10k and we assume no obligation to update the forwardlooking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forwardlooking statements 

  

since we have a history of losses and negative operating cash flows and because we expect our operating losses to continue throughout all or a portion of fiscal 2003 we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 

  

we have incurred significant operating losses negative operating cash flows and have not yet achieved profitability from inception through july 2000 we spent significant funds on organizational and startup activities recruiting key managers and employees developing invisalign and developing our manufacturing and customer support resources we also spent significant funds on clinical trials and training programs to train dental professionals in the use of invisalign 

  

since july 2000 we have continued to incur significant operating expenses to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a result we will need to increase our revenue significantly while controlling our expenses to achieve profitability it is possible that we will not achieve profitability in the near future if at all and even if we do achieve profitability we may not sustain or increase profitability in the future 

  

we may be unable to raise additional capital if it should be necessary which could harm our ability to compete 

  

we have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have not yet achieved profitability as of december 31 2002 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 2742 million 

  

we expect to expend significant capital to continue to build our national brand expand our dental professional channels automate our manufacturing processes and develop both product and process technology in november 2002 we completed a private placement of common stock to a group of investors led by existing 

  

shareholders raising 181 million net of issuance costs in december 2002 we secured an accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit of up to 100 million and a equipmentbased term loan of 50 million which was accessed in december 2002 as of march 26 2003 we had not utilized the accounts receivablebased revolving line of credit accessing the accounts receivable basedrevolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and compliance with customary loan covenants there can be no assurance that such financing will be adequate for us to avoid reducing operating expenses by including but not limited to reducing planned capital expenditures relating to enhancing our manufacturing process and reducing worldwide staff 

  

we have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate significantly which may cause our stock price to decline 

  

we were incorporated in april 1997 and began sales of invisalign in july 1999 thus we have a limited operating history which makes an evaluation of our future prospects and your investment in our stock difficult in addition we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we increase our commercial sales these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

  

   

   

   

   

to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenue for a particular period falls below our expectations we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels 

  

due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 

  

we have limited product offerings and if demand for invisalign declines or fails to develop as we expect our revenue will decline 

  

we expect that revenue from the sale of invisalign will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign is critical to our future success invisalign may not achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect or at all which could reduce our revenue and results of operations 

  

if dental professionals do not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate our operating results will be harmed 

  

as of december 31 2002 approximately 8500 of the worldwide dental professionals we have trained had submitted one or more cases to us our success depends upon increasing acceptance of invisalign by dental professionals invisalign requires dental professionals and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways in addition because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july 1997 and commercially available only since july 1999 dental professionals may be reluctant to adopt it until 

  

more historical clinical results are available also increasing adoption by dental professionals will depend on factors such as the capability safety efficacy ease of use price quality and reliability of our products and our provision of effective sales support training and service in the future unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and consequently reduced acceptance by dental professionals if invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and dental communities our operating results will be harmed 

  

if consumers do not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate our operating results will be harmed 

  

invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and patients may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment in addition patients may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for invisalign which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment we have generally received positive feedback from both dental professionals and patients regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients our success will depend upon the acceptance of invisalign by the substantially larger number of dental professionals and potential patients to which we are now actively marketing we have had a limited number of complaints from patients and prospective patients generally related to shipping delays and minor manufacturing irregularities market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals as well as other factors including effectiveness safety reliability improved treatment aesthetics and greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products furthermore consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience adoption by consumers may also be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending all of which could be affected by unstable global economic political or other conditions if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate our operating results will be harmed 

  

we are dependent on our international manufacturing operations which exposes us to foreign operational political and other risks that may harm our business 

  

currently two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of our clincheck ™ product and are used to manufacture aligner molds a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners and ships the completed products to our customers our costs associated with these operations are denominated in costa rican colons mexican pesos and us dollars 

  

in july 2002 we announced a plan to streamline worldwide operations the plan included closing our facilities in pakistan and the uae we transitioned the operations performed at these facilities to the united states and costa rica for the period ending december 31 2002 we recorded severance charges of 23 million facility closure charges of 09 million a loss on disposal of fixed assets of 11 million and an impairment charge of 09 million related to the land in pakistan the land was written down to a zero value to reflect its fair value as estimated by management approximately 01 million of accrued charges related to professional fees were included in accrued liabilities as of december 31 2002 we discontinued operations at our pakistan and uae facilities in october and december 2002 respectively we concluded the remainder of indirect operational activities related to the costa rica transition in january 2003 we will cease nonoperational closing activities in pakistan when the land is disposed of at that location and in the uae when the necessary statutory filings have been completed 

  

our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation including 

  

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if any of these risks materialize in the future our operating results may be harmed 

  

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed 

  

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of december 31 2002 we had 29 issued us patents 20 issued foreign patents 69 pending us patent applications and numerous pending foreign patent applications 

  

we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not issue as patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws we also rely on protection of our copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect pricing and market share 

  

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim our ability to grow our business will be severely limited 

  

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of another party’s patent in the past and while that action has been dismissed we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 

  

in january 2003 ormco corporation filed suit against align technology inc in the united states district court for the central district orange county division asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 

  

5683243 and 6244861 the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief in february 2003 align answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of the asserted patents in addition align counterclaimed for infringement of its us patent no 6398548 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief ormco filed a reply to align’s counterclaims on march 10 2003 and asserted counterclaims against align seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of us patent no 6 398 548 align’s response to ormco’s counterclaims is due in early april 2003 no trial or other dates have yet been set by the court 

  

three years ago ormco filed suit against align asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 in june 2000 the parties entered into a stipulation of dismissal with ormco ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation with respect to these patents except as set forth below further ormco agreed that it would not bring any patent action against align for at least a period of one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents if ormco were to bring such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year the stipulation of dismissal would allow ormco to include in such an action claims involving us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 in august 2001 ormco notified align of the issuance of us patent no 6244861 and offered a license for this patent align did not take a license to this patent five months after ormco’s notification it filed the lawsuit that is currently pending 

  

the claims in us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 relate to methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances the relevant claims are limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient the claims in us patent no 6244861 are more generic claims relating to the methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances based on the disclosure in the patent however the relevant claims also appear to be limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient’s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient the treatment plan simulation developed in align’s facilities determines the final positioning of a patient’s teeth but is not based on a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient 

  

the claims in align’s us patent no 6398548 relate to methods and systems for incrementally moving teeth using a series of appliances designed to be placed successively on the patient’s teeth 

  

align strongly believes that ormco’s claims of infringement lack merit and that align’s counterclaim of infringement will be successful however the outcome of a lawsuit is inherently unpredictable should align’s technology be found to infringe any one of ormco’s asserted patents align would have to seek a license from ormco which license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in that event align could be subject to damages or an injunction which could materially adversely affect its business 

  

from time to time we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights which have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in a patent suit by ormco or in any other litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected 

  

  

we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process and if our access to these inputs is diminished our business may be harmed 

  

we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process we rely on a third party manufacturer in mexico to fabricate aligners and to ship the completed product to customers as a result if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible 

  

in addition we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of delivery delays or shortages of these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed 

  

we have experienced rapid growth and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business 

  

we have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in 1999 our headcount increased from approximately 50 employees as of september 30 1999 to approximately 608 employees as of december 31 2002 this expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the us and internationally in particular rapid growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas including recruiting and retaining sufficient skilled personnel providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards and preserving our culture and values also recent reductions in our workforce although designed to not affect service levels and demand generation may adversely affect these areas of our business our inability to effectively manage this level of growth could harm our business 

  

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 

  

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering and management teams the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel in addition few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel our business could be materially harmed 

  

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition in the future 

  

currently our invisalign product competes directly against a product called red white and blue which is manufactured and distributed by ormco a subsidiary of sybron dental specialities in addition manufacturers of traditional braces such as 3m company sybron dental specialities and dentsply international inc have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by our competitors our business could be harmed 

  

  

complying with the food and drug administration fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 

  

our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action which may include recalling products ceasing product marketing and paying significant fines and penalties one or more of these enforcement actions could limit product sales delay product shipment and adversely affect our profitability 

  

in the us we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections which we have yet to undergo if we or any third party manufacturer of our products do not conform to applicable quality system regulations we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process 

  

before we can sell a new medical device in the us we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda through the premarket notification provisions of section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act we may be unable to maintain the necessary clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we market in the future our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 

  

if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised patient care could suffer we could be liable for related damages and our reputation could be impaired 

  

we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers therefore it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure despite the implementation of security measures our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical breakins computer viruses programming errors attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems if we fail to meet our clients’ expectations we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired in addition patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner our insurance may not protect us from this risk 

  

if compliance with government regulations of healthcare becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us we may not be able to grow our business 

  

participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our healthcare service provider payor and plan customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

  

  

the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences regulations implemented pursuant to hipaa may require us to make unplanned enhancements of software applications or services result in delays or cancellations of orders or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants the affect of hipaa on our business is difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

  

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 

  

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

  

   

   

   

complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and timeconsuming and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 

  

we face risks related to our international sales including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 

  

sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all we currently sell our product in europe the united kingdom mexico brazil australia and hong kong and may expand into other countries from time to time we do not know whether orthodontists dentists and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

  

our business exposes us to potential product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 

  

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management’s attention away from the operation of our business and could harm our business 

  

  

in fiscal 2002 the market price for our common stock has declined significantly and was highly volatile 

  

in fiscal 2002 the trading price of our common stock declined was highly volatile and could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future we would incur substantial legal fees and our management’s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

  

concentrations of ownership and agreements among our existing executive officers directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate transactions 

  

the interests of our management could conflict with those of our other stockholders as of december 31 2002 our executive officers directors and principal stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately 602 of our outstanding common stock these stockholders if acting together would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us which in turn could reduce the market price of our stock 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

quantitative disclosures 

  

we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 

  

interest rate risk  we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents availableforsale marketable securities existing longterm debts and any future financing requirements interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by monitoring maturities in our marketable securities portfolio our longterm debt at december 31 2002 consists of outstanding balances on lease obligations of 10 million and a 50 million equipmentbased term loan 

  

the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities do not exceed fiscal year 2003 and the interest rates are primarily fixed our capital lease obligations of 10 million at december 31 2002 carry fixed interest rates of 653 and 1115 per annum with principal payments due in 60 and 48 monthly installments respectively beginning in 2000 

  

in december 2002 we obtained a 50 million equipmentbased term loan which accrues interest at a rate of 225 above prime as of december 31 2002 we had drawn down 50 million from the equipmentbased term loan principal payments are due in 36 monthly installments beginning in january 2003 

  

the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amounts and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and longterm debt instruments 

  

   

qualitative disclosures 

  

interest rate risk  our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to 

  

   

   

   

we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity as a result would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and longterm marketable securities portfolio 

  

  

we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding longterm debts through the use of fixed rate debt management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis 

  

currency rate risk  our primary currency rate risk exposures relate to 

  

   

we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures or intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates the exposure related to currency rate movements would not likely have a material impact on future net income or cash flows for the foreseeable future

overview

we design manufacture and market invisalign® a proprietary new method for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces invisalign also offers dental professionals a new means of carrying out their diagnosis and treatment planning processes we believe invisalign has the potential to transform the traditional practice of orthodontics by appealing to people who would not otherwise seek treatment

in the us alone over 200 million individuals have some form of malocclusion each year less than one percent of these individuals or approximately two million americans enter orthodontic treatment spending approximately 7 billion in the aggregate we believe invisalign is a compelling treatment alternative for most of the patients who would seek traditional orthodontic treatment in addition given the significant benefits of invisalign we have the opportunity to expand the us orthodontic market by addressing the needs of millions of individuals who would not otherwise seek treatment further we believe the international opportunity is larger than the us opportunity

we received fda clearance to market invisalign in 1998 and started commercial sales in july 1999 our 510k clearance from the fda allows us to market the invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion we voluntarily restrict the use of invisalign to adults and adolescents with mature dentition individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially complete jaw growth this group represents approximately 130 million people in the us typically girls by the age of 13 years and boys by the age of 16 years will have developed mature dentition currently we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing as the effectiveness of invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment based on our clinical studies to date we recommend that dental professionals use invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for unusually severe malocclusions 

historically we limited our training of dental professionals to orthodontists in the us and canada in october 2001 we expanded our training in the us and canada to include dentists as of february 28 2002 we had trained over 12000 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those dental professionals trained approximately 80 are dental professionals in the us and canada which we consider our domestic market within our domestic market we have trained over 7300 orthodontists representing approximately 80 of all practicing orthodontists in the us and canada and over 2300 dentists as of february 28 2002 over 4300 of the worldwide dental professionals we have trained had submitted one or more cases to us and over 44000 patients have commenced treatment with invisalign

our objective is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic malocclusion our sales and marketing efforts focus on educating both consumers and dental professionals on the significant benefits of invisalign we continue to train dental professionals and work with them to increase the use of invisalign within their practices in september 2000 we initiated a national advertising campaign to create awareness of invisalign as a treatment alternative and to stimulate demand for treatment with invisalign in 2001 we continued to advertise nationally using a broader marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of applicability of invisalign

industry background

malocclusion

malocclusion is one of the most prevalent clinical conditions affecting over 200 million individuals or approximately 75 of the us population approximately two million people annually elect orthodontic treatment in the us generating industry revenues of approximately 7 billion while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay tooth loss gum disease jaw joint pain and headaches because of the compromised aesthetics discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek treatment 

traditional orthodontic treatment

dental professionals today apply traditional techniques and principles of orthodontic treatment developed in the early 20th century in the us dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and brackets commonly referred to as braces occasionally in an attempt to improve treatment aesthetics dental professionals use ceramic toothcolored brackets or bond brackets on the inside or lingual surfaces of the patients teeth dental professionals also augment braces with elastics metal bands headgear and other ancillary devices

the average treatment takes approximately two years to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement or chair time to initiate treatment a dental professional will diagnose a patients condition and create an appropriate treatment plan in a subsequent visit the dental professional will bond brackets to the patients teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets thereafter by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patients teeth to achieve desired tooth movement because of the length of time between visits the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval in a final visit the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patients teeth

fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between 3000 to 5000 and are generally not reimbursed by insurance in addition dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professionals estimate of chair time and are generally negotiated in advance a treatment that exceeds the dental professionals estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time or reduced profitability for the dental professional

limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment

although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with 

unattractive appearance  braces call attention to the patients condition and treatment in addition braces trap food which can further compromise appearance braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth many adults associate braces with adolescence as a result of these and other limitations less than one half of one percent of american adults with malocclusion elect orthodontic treatment annually 

oral discomfort  braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth the tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort especially in the days after an orthodontic visit 

poor oral hygiene  braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more difficult to brush and floss these problems can result in tooth decay and periodontal damage additionally the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth 

inability to project treatment  historically dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment accordingly dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment as a result they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits this lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professionals ability to estimate the duration of treatment because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental professional 

physical demands on dental professional  the manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional 

root resorption  the sustained high levels of force associated with conventional treatment can result in root resorption a shortening of tooth roots this shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient 

emergencies  at times braces need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional 

due to the poor aesthetics discomfort and other limitations of braces relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment accordingly we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability

the align solution

invisalign is a proprietary new system for treating malocclusion invisalign consists of two components clincheck™ and aligners

clincheck clincheck is an interactive internet application that allows dental professional to diagnose and plan treatment for their patients we use a dental impression and a treatment prescription submitted by a dental professional to develop a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments clincheck allows the dental professional to view this threedimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle accordingly clincheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible

upon review of the clincheck simulation the dental professional may immediately approve our projected treatment or may provide us with feedback for modification we reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation upon the dental professionals approval of the clincheck simulation we use the data underlying the simulation to manufacture the patients aligners 

aligners  aligners are custommanufactured clear removable dental appliances that when worn in prescribed series provide orthodontic treatment each aligner covers a patients teeth and is nearly invisible when worn aligners are commonly worn in pairs over the upper and lower dental arches aligners are generally worn for consecutive twoweek periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment simulation after two weeks of use the patient discards the aligners and replaces them with the next pair in the series this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete upon completion of the treatment the dental professional may at his or her discretion prescribe that the patient wear the final aligner as a retainer 

benefits of invisalign

we believe that invisalign provides benefits to patients and dental professionals that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces 

benefits to the patient

excellent aesthetics  aligners are nearly invisible when worn eliminating the aesthetic concerns associated with conventional braces 

comfort  by replacing the sixweek adjustment cycle of traditional braces with twoweek stages aligners move teeth more gently also aligners are thin smooth and low in profile as a result aligners are substantially more comfortable and less abrasive than conventional braces 

improved oral hygiene  patients can remove aligners for tasks that are difficult with conventional braces such as eating brushing and flossing we believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal damage during treatment 

potentially reduced overall treatment time  aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth in addition the clincheck simulation from which aligners are produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements together these factors may significantly reduce overall treatment time relative to conventional braces 

potentially reduced root resorption  we believe that controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption 

reduced incidence of emergencies  typically a lost or broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in series minimizing inconvenience to both patient and dental professional 

we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of conventional braces

benefits to the dental professional 

ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes  we believe that clincheck is the only product that enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely final outcome of treatment in an interactive threedimensional computer model clincheck allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the alternative they feel is most appropriate for the patient 

minimal additional training  the biomechanical principles that underlie invisalign are consistent with those of traditional orthodontics dental professionals can complete our initial training and certification program within a day 

ease of use  when treating patients with invisalign dental professionals do not spend their time manipulating wires and brackets this allows them to spend proportionately more time diagnosing and interacting with their patients 

significantly expanded patient base  we believe invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics currently less than one percent of the over 200 million people with malocclusion in the us enter treatment each year we believe that invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment 

higher fees  dental professionals typically charge between 3000 and 5000 for a course of conventional treatment due to the substantial patient benefits of invisalign we believe dental professionals offering invisalign have generally been able to command a significant premium in our experience the premiums charged by dental professionals for invisalign have been comparable to other treatment alternatives that attempt to improve the aesthetics of conventional braces such as ceramic and lingual braces 

decreased dental professional and staff time  invisalign reduces both the frequency and length of patient visits invisalign eliminates the need for timeintensive processes such as bonding appliances to the patients teeth adjusting archwires during the course of treatment and removing the appliances at the conclusion of treatment as such use of invisalign significantly reduces dental professional and staff chair time and can increase practice throughput 

we believe the combination of increased patient volume higher fees per case and reduced chair time has the potential to substantially improve orthodontic practice profitability

limitations of invisalign

in some instances invisalign may have certain limitations relative to conventional treatment aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in conventional treatment depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional the cost of invisalign to the patient may be greater than for conventional braces dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan once a dental professional submits a case to us there is generally a turn around time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered aligners may not be appropriate for all cases such as unusually severe malocclusion which may require aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal results in addition because aligners are removable treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech we believe that these limitations are outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals

 

our target market

commercial sales of invisalign commenced in the us in july 1999 as of february 28 2002 approximately 44000 patients have entered treatment using invisalign

our 510k clearance from the fda allows us to market invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion we voluntarily restrict the use of invisalign to adults and adolescents with mature dentition individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially complete jaw growth this group represents approximately 130 million people in the us typically girls by the age of 13 years and boys by the age of 16 years will have developed mature dentition currently we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing as the effectiveness of invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment based on our clinical studies to date we recommend that dental professionals use invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for unusually severe malocclusions

approximately two million patients enter into traditional orthodontic treatment in the us annually these patients represent less than one percent of the population of people with malocclusion of these over 50 or more than one million patients have mature dentition and are therefore natural candidates for invisalign

in addition we believe that we have an immediate and substantial market expansion opportunity our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations we believe that by addressing the primary limitations of braces invisalign will encourage this group to seek treatment adults who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment represent our most significant market expansion opportunity 

we continue to focus on the domestic market opportunity and have expanded our focus on selected international markets as we believe a large international market opportunity exists 

business strategy

our objective is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic malocclusion key elements of our strategy include the following 

educate dental professionals and stimulate demand for invisalign treatment  our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers we intend to significantly increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually we successfully tested consumer advertising in two lead markets and in september 2000 initiated a national advertising campaign in order to create awareness of invisalign as a treatment alternative and to establish the invisalign brand name in 2001 we continued to advertise nationally using a broader marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of applicability of invisalign in october 2001 we expanded our training of dental professionals in our domestic market to include dentists as of february 28 2002 we had trained over 12000 dental professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of invisalign 

communicate practice benefits of invisalign to dental professionals  invisalign provides substantial financial incentives to dental professionals by enabling them to increase patient volume charge a premium price and reduce chair time per treatment we intend to continue to emphasize these practice benefits to dental professionals through our sales and training efforts

expand and enhance manufacturing capability  our manufacturing operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom aligners at a high level of quality to improve cost efficiency we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively low wage countries we intend to maintain manufacturing capacity in excess of projected demand to reduce the risk that manufacturing capacity constrains our ability to grow our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process by continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes we plan to increase the level of production automation increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both unit costs and production times 

extend and defend technology leadership  invisalign represents a significant technological advancement in orthodontics we believe that our issued patents multiple pending patents and other intellectual property provide us with a substantial lead over potential competitors one of our issued us patents is written to broadly cover any algorithmic method of segmenting orthodontic treatment into a sequence of three or more steps based on calculated initial and final representations of a patients dentition we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 

expand our target patient base  invisalign can provide complete treatment for patients with mature dentition and a broad range of malocclusion in addition we believe that invisalign can provide partial treatment of unusually severe malocclusions in an effort to demonstrate invisaligns ability to comprehensively treat such cases we initiated the publication of a series of clinical case studies and articles that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases of even severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional improvements to the product

build an international presence  initially we focused our sales and marketing efforts on the us and canadian market opportunities while we continue to focus on this domestic market we have begun to introduce invisalign in selected international markets we believe that potential international demand for invisalign exceeds that of our domestic market 

manufacturing

we produce highly customized close tolerance medical quality products in volume to do so we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies these technologies include complex software solutions destructive and white light scanning techniques stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication

we believe the complexity inherent in producing such highly customized devices in volume is a barrier to potential competitors furthermore we believe the sophisticated software we use to guide a custom manufacturing process on a large scale was not available until we developed it 

manufacturing is coordinated in santa clara california where as of december 31 2001 we employed a manufacturing staff of approximately 135 people in addition we employed a software development team comprising approximately 30 software engineers with backgrounds in computational geometry animation computeraided design and various manufacturing industries we also employ approximately 500 software operators and other staff in our facilities in lahore pakistan who are responsible for the creation of treatment simulations in late 2001 we began developing operations in the united arab emerites uae and costa rica which will also create treatment simulations in addition we outsource the fabrication and packaging of aligners to a contract manufacturer based in juarez mexico 

the invisalign treatment process

invisalign treatment process comprises the following five stages 

orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us in an initial patient visit the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment the dental professional then prepares treatment data which consists of an impression of the relevant dental arches xrays of the patients dentition photographs of the patient a wax bite depicting the relationship between the patients upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form or prescription the impression is a critical component as it depicts the threedimensional geometry of the patients teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material this material hardens capturing the shape of the patients teeth the prescription is also a critical component describing the desired positions and movement of the patients teeth the dental professional sends the treatment data to our santa clara facility 

preparation of threedimensional computer models of the patients initial malocclusion  upon receipt we use the treatment data to construct plaster models of the patients dentition we scan the plaster models to develop a digital threedimensional computer model of the patients current dentition we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professionals prescription electronically to our facilities in lahore pakistan

preparation of computersimulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clinche ck in pakistan we transform this initial model into a customized threedimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of twoweek increments this simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards upon passing review the simulation is then delivered to the prescribing dental professional via clincheck on our website at wwwinvisaligncom the dental professional then reviews the clincheck simulation on a computer and on occasion asks us to make adjustments by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and thus participates in the customized design of the aligners at this point the dental professional may also invite the patient to review clincheck allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment the dental professional then approves the proposed treatment and in doing so engages us for the manufacture of corresponding aligners 

construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment we use the approved clincheck simulation to construct a series of molds of the patients teeth each mold is a replica of the patients teeth at each twoweek stage of the simulated course of treatment these molds are fabricated at our santa clara facility using custom manufacturing techniques that we have adapted for use in orthodontic applications 

manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional we ship these molds to juarez mexico where our contract manufacturer fabricates aligners by pressure forming polymeric sheets over each mold the aligners are then trimmed polished cleaned packaged and following final inspection shipped directly to the prescribing dental professional in certain cases dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with clear attachments bonded to the patients teeth these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement 

historically we have shipped aligners in batches the first batch which typically represented the first several months of treatment was produced once the prescribing dental professional approved clincheck thereafter aligners were sent at approximately six month intervals until completion of treatment in midfebruary 2001 for cases where clincheck was approved we began shipping all the aligners in a single batch in addition we began accelerating the shipments of aligners for cases where clincheck was approved prior to midfebruary 2001

throughput management because we manufacture each case on a buildtoorder basis we cannot build inventories as a result we must conservatively build manufacturing throughput for anticipated demand to increase throughput we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 

in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of ratelimiting processes or bottlenecks in 2001 we upgraded our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data which reduced time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case and thereby increased the efficiency of our technicians in pakistan we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication of aligners currently conducted in mexico in order to scale our manufacturing capacity we continue to invest in facilities and capital equipment 

quality assurance

our quality assurance system is compliant with fda medical device regulations 21cfr part 820 and during 2001 we achieved certification to iso 90011994 an internationally recognized quality system our system defines processes and procedures to ensure product and service quality and includes methods to monitor levels of quality based on internal data and direct customer feedback we utilize this data to continuously improve our systems and processes taking corrective action as required

we custom manufacture aligners on a buildtoorder basis so we do not offer refunds on our products because each clincheck and each aligner is unique we inspect 100 of the product at various points in the manufacturing process to ensure that the product meets our customers expectations however aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship defective or broken aligners must be returned to us for credit evaluation in the event that returned aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty we will replace the aligners at our expense our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners and as a result requests additional invisalign treatment the dental professional pays for the additional expense 

the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign however if actual treatment results deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan the dental professional may request a midcourse correction under the invisalign product warranty these deviations have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth a midcourse correction requires that the dental professional submit new molds of the patients dentition to us we use the molds to create a new clincheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment under the invisalign product warranty we will provide patients with one midcourse correction at our expense to address significant deviations from the approved clincheck treatment plan

in the event that a dental professional wishes to effect additional adjustments to a patients treatment when the actual treatment results are in accordance with the approved clincheck treatment plan the dental professional may request a midcourse correction or additional aligners however in these cases the midcourse correction and additional aligners are provided at the dental professionals expense in addition should a dental professional request a replacement for a lost aligner we charge the dental professional for the cost of the replacement aligner 

sales and marketing

we market invisalign by communicating invisaligns benefits directly to consumers and dental professionals with a nationwide advertising campaign based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales in our test markets we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign in order to serve anticipated worldwide demand we are training a broad base of dental professionals 

consumer marketing

our national consumer marketing efforts primarily focus on television advertising and are supported by print event marketing public relations and direct mail campaigns we tested our consumer marketing strategy in two markets austin texas and san diego california based on the positive results of these initial marketing efforts in september 2000 we launched a nationwide consumer marketing campaign to create awareness and stimulate demand for invisalign in 2001 we continued to advertise nationally using a broader marketing mix to drive consumer and dental professional demand and to reinforce the breadth of applicability of invisalign 

our experience indicates that prospective patients exposed to our advertising seek information from four primary sources 

a general practice dentist an orthodontist our tollfree support line 1800invisible and our website wwwinvisaligncom our marketing efforts have generated substantial consumer interest directed toward our telephone support line and our website our telephone support line and our website not only provide consumers with information on invisalign but importantly also allow us to channel consumer interest to dental professionals of our choice traditionally we have outsourced the telephone support function to a large national call center operator during 2001 we transitioned this function inhouse we maintain the outsourced function for backup and peak periods

professional marketing

professional marketing consists of training dental professionals and assisting them in building their practices as of december 31 2001 our sales team consisted of 32 salespeople experienced in orthodontic product sales approximately 31 technical support staff together with the marketing department and our inhouse orthodontic staff support the sales team our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july 1999 in october 2001 through our partner discus dental we began marketing invisalign to general dentists in our domestic market under a five year marketing agreement discus dental will act as our exclusive invisalign marketing and sales representative providing training certification marketing and clinical support to general dentists in the us and canada

as of february 28 2002 we had trained over 12000 dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign of those dental professionals trained approximately 80 are dental professionals in the us and canada which we consider our domestic market within our domestic market we have trained over 7300 orthodontists representing approximately 80 of all practicing orthodontists in the us and canada and over 2300 dentists as of february 28 2002 over 4300 of the worldwide dental professionals we have trained had submitted one or more cases to us and over 44000 patients have commenced treatment with invisalign our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability instructions on filling out the invisalign prescription form guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of our website 

invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment and we present our training material in a manner consistent with dental professionals training and experience as a result we are able to complete these training workshops within one day our success in training a large number of dental professionals confirms our belief that training represents a minimal barrier to adoption for most dental professionals 

after training sales representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases such follow up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions establishing an internet connection and familiarizing them with our website sales representatives may also provide practicebuilding assistance including helping the dental professional market to local general practice dentists and to prospective patients through direct mail or other media indeed many practices have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 

we have developed a system of tiering dental professionals that encourages our sales force to devote more time to those dental professionals most proficient in the use of invisalign 

we use objective criteria primarily the number of cases initiated with invisalign to tier dental professionals inquiries from prospective patients through our customer call center and our website are directed to higher tier dental professionals we believe the tiering process will rapidly increase the penetration of our product within selected dental professionals offices 

general dentists play an important role in informing their patients about orthodontics and are a key source of both referrals to orthodontists and invisalign case submissions there are over 120000 active general practice dentists in the us and canada through our agreement with discus dental we educate these general dentists and staff to encourage them to recommend invisalign to their patients 

research and development

as of december 31 2001 our research and development team consisted of 21 individuals with medical device development orthodontic and other relevant backgrounds prior to commercial launch in july 1999 our research and development strategy had three primary objectives developing invisalign establishing the ability of invisalign to treat malocclusion and developing software and processes to enable the manufacture of aligners in volume since our commercial launch our research and development effort has focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our line of products

in an effort to demonstrate invisaligns broad treatment capabilities we initiated the publication of a series of clinical case studies and articles that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases of even severe complexity we are also undertaking postmarketing studies and making additional improvements to the product in 2001 we upgraded our proprietary threedimensional treatmentplanning software primarily to increase our manufacturing capacity and efficiency our product development team is testing enhanced materials and a number of complementary products that we expect will provide additional revenue opportunities 

intellectual property

we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage as of february 28 2002 we have nine issued us patents 11 issued foreign patents 52 pending us patent applications and 121 pending foreign patent applications 

we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and nondisclosure agreements we also seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or may issue in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products 

competition

we are not aware of any company that has developed or is marketing a system comparable to invisalign however we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of other orthodontic products these suppliers include manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances such as 3m company sybron dental specialities ormco and dentsply international inc 

we believe that in addition to price the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following factors 

aesthetic appeal of the treatment method comfort associated with the treatment method effectiveness of treatment ease of use and dental professionals chair time we believe that invisalign compares favorably with respect to each of these factors 

government regulation

fda regulation of medical devices  invisalign is regulated as a medical device accordingly our product development labeling manufacturing processes and promotional activities are subject to extensive review and rigorous regulation by government agencies in countries in which we sell our products 

in the us the fda regulates the design manufacture distribution preclinical and clinical study clearance and approval of medical devices medical devices are classified in one of three classes on the basis of the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness class i or ii devices require the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution which is known as 510k clearance class iii devices which are deemed by the fda to pose greater risk than class i and ii devices require fda approval of a premarket approval application which includes among other things extensive preclinical and clinical trial data and information about the devices and its components design manufacturing and labeling 

invisalign is a class i device the least stringent class which only requires general controls including labeling premarket notification and adherence to the fdas quality system regulations in addition because invisalign is a class i device we are required to register contract manufacturers located outside the us with the fda accordingly we have registered our mexicobased contract manufacturer elamex elamex is certified under iso an internationally recognized quality standard and also performs subcontractor manufacturing for other usbased medical device companies our quality system and procedures are set up to comply with all fda regulations elamex has dedicated an area in its facilities and personnel for our exclusive use we have supplied elamex with procedures for how to manufacture and ship our products and have trained elamexs personnel thus assuring compliance with fda regulations as long as the procedures are followed we conduct frequent visits to the mexico facility to monitor elamexs performance and its compliance with our procedures 

in november 1998 invisalign received 510k premarket notification by the fda allowing us to market invisalign in the us the manufacture and distribution of invisalign are subject to continuing regulation by the fda we are subject to routine inspections by the fda to determine compliance with facility registration product listing requirements medical device reporting regulations and quality system requirements the quality system regulation is similar to good manufacturing practices and relates to product testing and quality assurance as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 

if the fda finds that we have failed to comply it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions including but not limited to financial penalties withdrawal of 510k premarket notification clearances already granted and criminal prosecution 

in europe invisalign is regulated as a custom device as such we will not be subject to regulations promulgated by the european community although we have the option to ce mark our product we achieved certification to iso 90011994 in fiscal 2001 which facilitates the commercialization of invisalign outside the us 

other federal and state laws as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal state and local levels some of which are and others of which may be applicable to our business furthermore our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 

laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects for example the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties are subject to substantial regulation by state governments these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly in addition provisions of the social security act prohibit among other things paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in or for the order purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by medicare medicaid and similar other federal or state health care programs most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws these laws are applicable to our financial relationships with and any marketing or other promotional activities involving our dental professional customers finally various states regulate the operations of an advertising and referral service for dentists and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions

factors that may affect operating results

since we have a history of losses and negative operating cash flows and we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future we have incurred significant operating losses negative operating cash flows and have not achieved profitability from inception through july 2000 we spent significant funds in organizational and startup activities recruiting key managers and employees developing invisalign and developing our manufacturing and customer support resources we also spent significant funds on clinical trials and training programs to train dental professionals in the use of invisalign we expect to have net losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next 12 months

we intend to increase our operating expenses as we continue to

scale our manufacturing operations develop new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing processes execute our national direct to consumer marketing campaign increase the size of our sales force and dental professional training staff expand our manufacturing operations from pakistan to additional relatively lower wage countries including the uae and costa rica increase our international sales and marketing efforts undertake quality assurance and improvement initiatives and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations as a result we will need to increase our revenue significantly while controlling our expenses to achieve profitability it is possible that we will not achieve profitability and even if we do achieve profitability we may not sustain or increase profitability in the future

we may be unable to raise additional capital if it should be necessary which could harm our ability to compete

we have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have not achieved profitability as of december 31 2001 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 2061 million

we expect to expend significant capital to establish a national brand build manufacturing infrastructure and develop both product and process technology we believe that the existing cash balances the proceeds from our initial public offering in january 2001 and other potential financing alternatives will be sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next 12 months

we are currently working towards our objective of realizing profitability by achieving the key goal of successfully marketing our product throughout our domestic market and internationally while controlling our expenses the failure to win increased acceptance by orthodontists and dentists of invisalign could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions

if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we could be required to delay establishing a national brand building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology or to reduce our expenditures in general accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

we have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate significantly which may cause our stock price to decline

we were incorporated in april 1997 and began sales of invisalign in july 1999 thus we have a limited operating history which makes an evaluation of our future prospects and your investment in our stock difficult in addition we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we increase our commercial sales these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include

changes in the timing of product orders unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity any disruptions in the manufacturing process or in the introduction of new production processes inaccurate forecasting of revenue production and other operating costs and the development and marketing of directly competitive products by potential competitors to respond to these and other factors we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results most of our expenses such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations are relatively fixed in the short term moreover our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels as a result if our revenue for a particular period falls below our expectations we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels

due to these and other factors we believe that quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance

we have limited product offerings and if demand for invisalign declines or fails to develop as we expect our revenue will decline

we expect that revenue from the sale of invisalign will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign is critical to our future success invisalign may not achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect or at all which could reduce our revenue

if dental professionals do not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate our operating results will be harmed as of december 31 2001 approximately 3700 orthodontists have submitted one or more cases to us our success depends upon increasing acceptance by orthodontists and dentists of invisalign invisalign requires dental professionals and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways and to interact with us as a supplier in addition because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july 1997 and commercially available since july 1999 dental professionals may be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available also increasing adoption by dental professionals will depend on factors such as the capability safety efficacy ease of use price quality and reliability of our products and our provision of effective sales support training and service in the future unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and consequently in reduced acceptance by dental professionals if invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and dental communities our operating results will be harmed

if consumers do not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate our operating results will be harmed

invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment and patients may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment in addition patients may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment while we have generally received positive feedback from both dental professionals and patients regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion our success will depend upon the rapid acceptance of invisalign by the substantially larger number of potential patients to which we are now actively marketing we have had a limited number of complaints from patients and prospective patients generally related to shipping delays and minor manufacturing irregularities market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dentists and orthodontists as well as other factors including effectiveness safety reliability improved treatment aesthetics and greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products furthermore consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience adoption by consumers may also be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly or in the numbers that we anticipate our operating results will be harmed

we are dependent on our international manufacturing operations which exposes us to foreign operational and political risks that may harm our business

two of our key production steps are performed in manufacturing operations located outside the us we currently rely on our facilities in pakistan to create electronic treatment plans with the assistance of sophisticated software in late 2001 we also began developing facilities in the uae and costa rica which will perform these functions we employ approximately 500 people in lahore pakistan most of who are pakistani in this effort in addition we rely on third party manufacturers in mexico to fabricate aligners and to ship the completed product to customers our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties including

political social and economic instability acts of war and acts of terrorism particularly in light of the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 difficulties in staffing and managing international operations controlling quality of manufacture interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services product or material transportation delays or disruption burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws trade restrictions and changes in tariffs import and export license requirements and restrictions fluctuations in currency exchange rates and potential adverse tax consequences if any of these risks materialize our operating results may be harmed

our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed

our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products both in the us and in other countries our inability to do so could harm our competitive position as of february 28 2002 we have nine issued us patents and 52 pending us patent applications we have 11 foreignissued patents and 121 pending foreign patent applications we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position however our currently pending or future patent filings may not issue as patents additionally any patents issued to us may be challenged invalidated held unenforceable circumvented or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products in addition protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws

we also rely on protection of copyrights trade secrets knowhow and proprietary information we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us however these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and future growth prospects in particular a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology which could adversely affect pricing and market share

if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties our ability to grow our business will be severely limited

extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry we have been sued for infringement of another partys patent in the past and while that action has been dismissed we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future

in january 2000 ormco corporation filed suit against us asserting an infringement of us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 the complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and equitable relief the complaint alleged that invisalign infringed certain claims of the two patents relating to computer modeling of an ideal dentition and the production of orthodontic appliances based upon the ideal dentition the suit has been dismissed but can be recommenced under certain circumstances see item 3legal proceedings if the ormco suit were recommenced and if ormco were to prevail we would have to seek a license from ormco which license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in that event we could be subject to damages or an injunction which could materially adversely affect our business

from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any valid and enforceable rights which have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in a patent suit by ormco or in any other litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in which event our business would be materially adversely affected

we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process and if our access to these inputs is diminished our business may be harmed 

we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process we rely on a third party manufacturer in mexico to fabricate aligners and to ship the completed product to customers in addition third party rapid prototyping bureaus fabricate some molds from which the aligners are formed as a result if any of our third party manufacturers fail to deliver their components or if we lose their services we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed finding substitute manufacturers may be expensive timeconsuming or impossible although we are in the process of developing the capability to fabricate all molds and aligners internally we may not be successful and may continue to rely on outsourcing in the future

in addition we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment rapid prototyping machines resin and other advanced materials we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies our rapid growth may exceed the capacity of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth in the event of delivery delays or shortages of these items our business and growth prospects may be harmed

we are growing rapidly and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business we have experienced significant growth in recent periods

our headcount increased from approximately 50 employees as of june 30 1999 to approximately 1100 employees as of december 31 2001 we expect that our growth will place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational financial and other internal controls both in the us and internationally in particular continued growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas including recruiting and retaining sufficient skilled personnel providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards and preserving our culture and values our inability to manage this growth effectively would harm our business

if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products

we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering and management teams the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business our future success will also depend on our ability to identify recruit train and retain additional qualified personnel there is currently a shortage of skilled clinical engineering and management personnel and intense competition for these personnel especially in silicon valley where our headquarters is located in addition few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices universities and other research institutions thus we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business furthermore we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services

we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition in the future

we are not aware of any company that is marketing or developing a system directly comparable to invisalign however manufacturers of traditional braces such as 3m company sybron dental specialities and dentsply international inc have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may in the future attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours large consumer products companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market furthermore we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by our competitors our business will be harmed

complying with the food and drug administration fda and other regulations is an expensive and timeconsuming process and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties

our products are medical devices and subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally fda regulations are wide ranging and govern among other things

product design development manufacture and testing product labeling product storage premarket clearance or approval advertising and promotion and product sales and distribution noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action which may include recalling products ceasing product marketing and paying significant fines and penalties which could limit product sales delay product shipment and adversely affect our profitability

in the us we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections which we have yet to undergo if we or any third party manufacturer of our products do not conform to applicable quality system regulations we may be required to find alternative manufacturers which could be a long and costly process

before we can sell a new medical device in the us we must obtain fda clearance or approval which can be a lengthy and timeconsuming process even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda through the premarket notification provisions of section 510k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act we may be unable to maintain the necessary clearances in the future furthermore we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we market in the future

extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties

in addition to medical device laws and regulations numerous state and federal healthcarerelated laws regulate our business covering areas such as 

storage transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records prohibitions against the offer payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods and the marketing and advertising of our products complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time consuming and could increase our costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our activities or our revenues

we face risks related to our international operations including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals

sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in other countries we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and in maintaining foreign regulatory approvals if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us or if we fail to receive these approvals we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner if at all we have recently launched sales of our product in germany france and the uk and intend to further expand our international operations we do not know whether orthodontists dentists and consumers will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate

our business exposes us to risks of product liability claims and we may incur substantial expenses if we are sued for product liability

medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities a product liability claim regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in significant legal defense costs these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and could harm our business

the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile

the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors many of which are beyond our control including

quarterly variations in our results of operations changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results speculation in the press or investment community strategic actions by our competitors such as product announcements or acquisitions and general market conditions in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities class action litigation has often been brought against the company if a securities class action suit is filed against us we would incur substantial legal fees and our managements attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation

concentrations of ownership and agreements among our existing executive officers directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate transactions

the interest of management could conflict with the interest of our other stockholders as of december 31 2001 our executive officers directors and principal stockholders beneficially owned in total approximately 477 of our outstanding common stock these stockholders if acting together would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company which in turn could reduce the market price of our stock










 item 2 properties

our headquarters are located in santa clara california we lease approximately 90000 square feet of space where we house our manufacturing customer support software engineering and administrative personnel the leases for our facilities expire between 2002 and 2005 the combined monthly rent for the santa clara facilities is approximately 270000 

we operate two facilities in pakistan both in the city of lahore the main facility comprises over 5000 square feet of office space the lease for this facility expires at the end of 2002 the second facility comprises over 10000 square feet of office space the lease for this facility expires in august 2010

as of december 31 2001 we have committed 12 million in funds to purchase approximately 215 acres of land in pakistan 




 item 3 legal proceedings

in february 2001 align technology was named in a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of all licensed dentists excluding orthodontists in the us the complaint alleged that align technologys policy of selling invisalign exclusively to orthodontists violated the us antitrust laws without admitting any wrongdoing the company entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit the total legal and other settlement costs that align has agreed to pay are approximately 400000 pursuant to the settlement align will undertake to train and certify 5000 general practice dentists each year over the next four years in november 2001 the court approved the stipulation and agreement of settlement

in january 2000 ormco corporation filed suit against us asserting infringement of us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 the complaint sought unspecified and monetary damages and injunctive relief in march 2000 we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and noninfringement of the asserted patents 

in june 2000 we entered into a stipulation of dismissal with ormco ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation with respect to these patents except as set forth below further ormco agreed that it would not bring any patent action against us for at least a period of one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents if ormco were to bring such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year the stipulation of dismissal would allow ormco to include in such an action claims involving us patent nos 5447432 and 5683243 in august 2001 ormco notified us of the issuance of us patent no 6244861 and offered a license for this patent no assurance can be given that ormco will not bring another action against us or that if brought it will not be successful should the suit be recommenced and should our technology be found to infringe we would have to seek a license from ormco which license might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in that event we could be subject to damages or an injunction which could materially adversely affect our business it is possible that depending on the scope of any new patents that are issued to ormco ormco will bring another patent action after a period of one year has passed 

the claims at issue in the ormco suit relate to methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances the relevant claims are limited to the calculation of the final positioning of a patients teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient the treatment plan simulation developed in our pakistan facilities determines the final positioning of a patients teeth but is not based on a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient 

from time to time we have received and may again receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights which have been brought to our attention there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report on form 10k this discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including but not limited to those set forth under factors that may affect operating results and elsewhere in this report on form 10k 

overview

from our inception in april 1997 to july 2000 we were engaged in the design manufacture and marketing of invisalign a proprietary new system for treating malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth in july 1999 we commenced commercial sales of invisalign prior to july 1999 we devoted nearly all our resources to developing our software and manufacturing processes clinical trials of invisalign and to building our sales force customer support and management teams we exited the development stage in july 2000 

invisalign has two components clincheck and aligners clincheck is an internetbased application that allows dental professionals to simulate treatment in three dimensions by modeling twoweek stages of tooth movement aligners are thin clear plastic removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each twoweek stage of the clincheck simulation aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by a dental professional using clincheck 

in the third quarter of 1999 we recognized revenue for the first time from the sale of invisalign and related dental impression machines manufactured by espe america inc we expect to sell dental impression machines to an orthodontist only once if at all accordingly sales of such machines are expected to represent a lower proportion of our revenue in the future substantially all our revenue is generated in the us and canada which taken together we regard as our domestic market 

while our expansion outside of our domestic market is still in the initial stages we do incur substantial operating costs outside of our domestic market two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us in our facilities in pakistan technicians use a sophisticated internally developed computermodeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans which are transmitted via the internet back to the us these files form the basis of our clincheck product and are used for the manufacture of aligner molds in addition a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates and performs finishing work on completed aligners and ships the completed products to our customers our costs associated with these operations are denominated in pakistani rupees and mexican pesos our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operations including among others political social and economic instability acts of war or terrorism difficulties in staffing and managing international operations controlling quality of manufacture interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services product or material transportation delays or disruption and trade restrictions and changes in tariffs however we believe these risks are mitigated in pakistan by the fact that our operations there do not involve the shipping or manufacturing of any physical products and in late 2001 we began developing facilities in the uae and costa rica which will also perform this function we believe the risks in mexico are mitigated by the fact that our operations there are governed under the provisions of the north american free trade agreement or nafta 

in october 2001 we entered into an exclusive marketing agreement with discus dental impressions inc under the terms of the agreement discus will act as our exclusive invisalign marketing and sales representative providing training certification marketing and clinical support to general dentists in the us and canada discus is required to maintain minimum sales quotas and will earn a commission on all products shipped under the terms of the agreement we are required under the terms of the agreement to provide minimum consumer advertising commensurate with discus meeting minimum sales quotas the initial term of the agreement expires december 31 2006 but is renewable for five years if not terminated earlier the agreement includes termination rights for convenience and for failure to meet agreed upon minimums 

we have not been profitable for any quarter since april 3 1997 inception as of december 31 2001 we had an accumulated deficit of 2061 million we expect to have net losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next 12 months due in part to our national consumer advertising campaign the expansion of manufacturing capacity our launching of our international sales and marketing efforts and continued research and development efforts we will need to generate significant revenue growth to achieve profitability and positive operating cash flow even if we do achieve profitability and positive cash flow we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability or positive operating cash flow on a quarterly or annual basis 

we earn revenue primarily from the sale of invisalign our revenue consists of the clincheck fee and the charge for each aligner we charge dental professionals a fixed fee for the treatment simulation viewed via clincheck on our website wwwinvisaligncom this fee is invoiced when the dental professional orders clincheck prior to the production of aligners in addition we charge dental professionals a fee for aligners upon shipment 

historically we have shipped aligners in batches the first batch which typically represented the first several months of treatment was produced once the prescribing dental professional approved clincheck thereafter aligners were sent at approximately six month intervals until completion of treatment in midfebruary 2001 for cases where clincheck was approved we began shipping all the aligners in a single batch 

fees from the sale of clincheck and aligners taken together are treated as revenues from a single invisalign case for cases where clincheck was approved prior to midfebruary 2001 revenues associated with a given case are recognized ratably as batches of aligners are shipped to the dental professional for orders placed subsequent to notification of our change to single batch shipments all of the revenues associated with a given case including clincheck fees will be recognized at the time the aligners are shipped the costs of producing the clincheck treatment plan which are incurred prior to the production of aligners are capitalized and recognized as related revenue is earned in the cases where we expect a net loss the entire loss is recognized immediately

results of operations

comparison of years ended december 31 2001 and 2000

liquidity and capital resources

prior to our initial public offering we financed our operations primarily through private sales of approximately 1289 million of convertible preferred stock we have also financed our operations through equipment leases and bank loans in january 2001 we received proceeds net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses incurred as a result of our initial public offering of approximately 1260 million as of december 31 2001 we had 657 million in cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of 2061 million additionally we have 723000 of restricted cash as of december 31 2001 

net cash used in operating activities totaled 779 million in 2001 588 million in 2000 and 116 million in 1999 the increase was primarily due to the increase in our net loss to 975 million in fiscal 2001 which is up from 887 million in fiscal 2000 and 154 million in fiscal 1999 and to a lesser extent increases in accounts receivable this was offset significantly by increased noncash charges related to amortization of deferred stock compensation and depreciation and amortization 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 20 million in 2001 416 million in 2000 and 36 million in 1999 for fiscal 2001 cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the investment of the initial public offering proceeds in marketable securities offsetting the cash used was cash provided by the maturities and sales of the marketable securities as well as the decrease in our restricted cash balance for fiscal 2000 cash used in investing activities was primarily used for the investment of the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock in marketable securities additionally for the year ended december 31 2000 there was a substantial increase in restricted cash of 156 million which primarily consisted of cash related to the transfer of funds to our media buying agent to fund our national advertising campaign offsetting the cash used was cash provided by the maturities and sales of the marketable securities for fiscal 1999 cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the investment of the proceeds from the sale of preferred stock in marketable securities additionally in each of these years there was a use of cash for the purchase of clinical and manufacturing equipment computers and facilities to support the expansion of our operations 

net cash from financing activities was 1275 million in 2001 964 million in 2000 and 196 million in 1999 for fiscal 2001 cash provided by financing activities was attributable primarily to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock principally through our initial public offering for fiscal 2000 and 1999 cash provided by financing activities was attributable to the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and convertible promissory notes that were converted to preferred stock 

we finance capital purchases through cash and capital leases we had capitalized lease obligations outstanding of 15 million at december 31 2001 and 19 million at december 31 2000 

our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market sell and support our products on a worldwide basis we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents shortterm and longterm investment balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing collaborative or other arrangements with other companies bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all if adequate funds are not available we could be required to delay establishing a national brand building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology or to reduce our expenditures in general accordingly the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial information for the periods indicated this information has been derived from unaudited financial statements that in the opinion of management have been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of such information the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future periods 

three months ended  2001 2000   december 31 september 30 june 30 march 31 december 31 september 30 june 30 march 31         in thousands except per share data revenues  12300  12912  13483  7689  3276  1439  1397  629 gross profit loss 2118 1647 347 3865 5433 3870 2810 1397 operating loss 20827 23026 23567 31425 35121 22127 15819 8048 net loss 20719 22503 22294 31958 35437 21839 23392 8080 net loss available to common stockholders  20719  22503  22294  43149  44803  21839  67542  8080 net loss per share available to common stockholders basic and diluted  045  050  050  129  739  384  1231  155 shares used in computing per share amounts basic and diluted 45660 45035 44518 33574 6066 5682 5489 5225  

historical quarterly operating results do not necessarily reflect our expectations of future quarterly operating results we believe that future operating results will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors including the rate of adoption of invisalign for the treatment of orthodontic malocclusion the rate which manufacturing operations is scaled the timing of automation of manufacturing processes and the extent of national direct to consumer marketing campaigns 

critical accounting policies

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to accounts receivable warranty accrual and income taxes we use authoritative pronouncements historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates actual results could differ from those estimates

we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we recognize revenues from product sales when there is pervasive evidence that an arrangement exits delivery has occurred the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured provisions for discounts and rebates to customers and other adjustments are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon analyses of historical discounts and rebates we accrue for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products our warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered defective or fail to meet the product specifications we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from customers inability to pay for product purchased if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we have established a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 109  accounting for income taxes  under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which thee differences are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

quantitative disclosures

we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 

interest rate risk  we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents availableforsale marketable securities existing longterm debts and any future financing requirements interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio the longterm debt at december 31 2001 consists only of outstanding balances on lease obligations 

the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities do not exceed fiscal year 2002 and the interest rates are primarily fixed our capital lease obligations of 15 million at december 31 2001 carry a fixed interest rate of 653 and 1115 per annum with principle payments due in 60 and 48 monthly installments respectively beginning in 2000 

the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amounts and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and longterm debt instruments 

expected maturity date as of december 31 2001  2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 total fair value        in thousands assets  cash cash equivalents  50550          50550  50550 shortterm marketable securities 12317     12317 12494 weighted average interest rate 554       longterm marketable securities    2578        2578  2627 weighted average interest rate  738      liabilities  fixed rate debt lease obligation  483  512  338  130    1463  1463 weighted average interest rate 830 830 653 653     

qualitative disclosures

interest rate risk  our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to 

the availableforsale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase our ability to pay longterm debts at maturity the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and longterm marketable securities portfolio 

we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding longterm debts through the use of fixed rate debt management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis 

currency rate risk  our primary currency rate risk exposures relate to 

our decentralized or outsourced operations whereby approximately 143 million of our expenses are related to operations outside the united states denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates the exposure related to currency rate movements would not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows
