dei at our company has been governed by our dei council which we refreshed in 2022 the council is chaired by our ceo phil snow and consists of 13 senior leaders who are empowered to drive our dei progress 

as part of this visible leadership commitment we signed the ceo action for diversity and inclusion pledge joining more than 2000 companies actively supporting more inclusive workplaces and communities we have also partnered with mlt black equity at work to hold ourselves accountable for our dei progress 

workforce 

during fiscal 2022 we accelerated our accountability efforts by continuing to embed dei into our talent processes including performance reviews promotions and the allocation of equity awards this allows us to make a greater impact while investigating statistical differences and taking any resulting appropriate action we also continue to publish our workforce demographics including our annual eeo1 federal data in our sustainability report by reporting our workforce demographics we make a visible step in our dei commitment as we aspire to change the composition of our employee demographics to better include underrepresented groups our goals include increasing the percentage of women at our company overall and specifically the percentage of women in our leadership group vice president level and above and in our technical areas we report on our progress annually to increase transparency and to facilitate accountability

as a key component of our drive to ensure fair and equitable administration of pay in fiscal 2022 we completed a global pay equity review we engaged an outside firm to assess the degree of systemic gender equity in the salaries of our employees worldwide and the degree of systemic raceethnicity equity in the us after controlling for various salaryinfluencing factors the study found that there was not a statistically significant association at our company between salary and gender worldwide or between salary and raceethnicity in the us the study found that on a global basis at our company women are paid more than 99 on average of what men are paid and that on a us basis minority employees are paid 100 on average of what nonminority employees are paid attention to pay equity will continue to be a dei priority 

our business resource groups brgs are a critical component in fostering an inclusive work environment for all employees our brgs asian brg black brg families brg pride brg multicultural brg latinx brg women’s brg and veterans brg host a variety of educational informational and aspirational events including business networking opportunities and heritage months our brgs also host many cosponsored external events and yearround engagement such as community events expos seminars and summits in addition our senior leaders serve as executive sponsors for our brgs to demonstrate leadership support for these efforts 

to recognize the significant contributions of our brgs we have launched the brg recognition program which provides equity awards to brg leaders at the cochair level and steering committee level who have gone above and beyond in their commitment to dei at our company brg steering committee leaders also have a 10 weighting of their overall review evaluation based upon their brg leadership to elevate these contributions within their performance 

to further our efforts in building an inclusive workplace where all employees feel a sense of belonging we have launched the global gender inclusivity policy that supports and respects the rights and identities of all employees and we have achieved a 100 score on the human rights campaign equality index for seven consecutive years inclusive education also continues to be a priority through the provision of a variety of educational opportunities such as conscious inclusion training the interfaith education series racial justice allies and unconscious bias training in addition we have rolled out namecoach a name pronunciation tool

how we work 

since the onset of the covid19 pandemic our highest priority concern has been the health and safety of our employees our families and our communities we initially required the vast majority of our employees at our offices across the globe to work remotely and provided them with support to be able to ensure business continuity we increased the frequency of allcompany meetings led by our ceo and offered extensive benefit resources and mental health support employees were offered additional paid time off for covid19 illness and family care and to receive and recover from covid19 vaccinations 

we have since reopened our offices and welcomed our employees back our offices did not reopen until local authorities permitted us to do so and our own criteria and conditions to ensure employees health and safety were satisfied 

in fiscal 2022 based on our success working in a remote environment during the covid19 pandemic we rolled out our how we work guide to flexible working arrangements under which employees in many of our locations where permitted by local laws and regulations and where the role permits have the opportunity to choose between different work arrangements including the ability to work in the office remotely or in a hybrid arrangement with the ability to split time between working remotely and in the office additionally employees whose positions are not aligned to fixed working hours may elect to work a flextime schedule working the same number of hours as is considered standard in their office location or employment contract but during different times in the working day we have found that these new standards support our employees in being their most productive selves at work and in their personal lives these arrangements preserve the benefit of flexibility while retaining talent fostering creativity innovation collaboration and enabling mentorship all key drivers behind employees’ productivity satisfaction and success furthermore these provisions support our commitment to creating a diverse equitable and inclusive workplace removing barriers to augment our opportunity to attract and retain talent

additional information with respect to our business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 




 item 1a risk factors 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows and as a result the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods investors should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation s and our consolidated financial statements including the related notes investors should carefully consider all risks including those disclosed here before making an investment decision 

technology  data security risks 

loss corruption and misappropriation of data and information relating to clients and others 

many of our products as well as our internal systems and processes involve the collection retrieval processing storage and transmission through a variety of media channels of our own as well as supplier and customer proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data we rely on and continuously invest in a complex system of internal processes and controls along with policies procedures and training designed to protect data that we receive in the ordinary course of business including information from client portfolios and strategies however these measures do not guarantee security and improper access to or release of confidential information may still occur through for example employee error or malfeasance system error other inadvertent release failure to properly purge and protect data or cyberattack additionally the maintenance and enhancement of our systems may not be completely effective in preventing loss unauthorized access or misappropriation data misappropriation unauthorized access or data loss could instill a lack of confidence in our products and systems and damage our brand reputation and business breaches of security measures could expose us our clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for us as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and suppliers many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy and protection of personal information including for example the european union general data protection regulation which became effective may 25 2018 the laws of multiple us states such as californias consumer privacy act which became effective january 1 2020 and chinas personal information protection law which became effective november 1 2021 these laws contain requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including our use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves the law in this area continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws could impact our processing of personal and sensitive information related to our content operations employees clients and suppliers and may expose us to claims of violations 

successful prohibited data access and other cyberattacks and the failure of cybersecurity systems and procedures 

in providing our digitalenabled services to clients we rely on information technology infrastructure that is managed internally along with placing reliance on thirdparty service providers for critical functions we and these thirdparty service providers are subject to the risks of system failures and security breaches including cyberattacks including those sponsored by nationstates terrorist organizations or global corporations seeking to illicitly obtain technology or other intellectual property such as phishing scams hacking viruses denials of service attacks tampering intrusions physical breakins ransomware and malware as well as employee errors or malfeasance in some cases these risks might be heightened when employees are working remotely our and our vendors use of mobile and cloud technologies may increase our risk for such threats our protective 

systems and procedures and those of third parties to which we are connected such as cloud computing providers may not be effective against these threats our information technology systems must be constantly updated and patched to protect against known vulnerabilities and to optimize performance 

while we have dedicated resources responsible for maintaining appropriate levels of cybersecurity and implemented systems and processes intended to help identify cyberattacks and protect and remediate our network infrastructure we are aware that these attacks have become increasingly frequent sophisticated and difficult to detect and as a result we may not be able to anticipate prevent or detect all such attacks we also may be impacted by a cyberattack targeting one of our vendors or within our technology supply chain or infrastructure our contracts with service providers typically require them to implement and maintain adequate security controls but we may not have the ability to effectively monitor these security measures as a result inadequacies of the thirdparty security technologies and practices may not be detected until after a security breach has occurred these risks may be heightened in connection with employees working from remote work environments as our dependency on certain service providers such as video conferencing and web conferencing services has significantly increased in addition to access our network products and services customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own security risk 

we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of clients’ or suppliers’ data other external data internal data or information technology systems if the services provided to clients were disrupted or if products or services were perceived as having security vulnerabilities the costs we would incur to address and resolve these security incidents would increase our expenses these types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits regulatory investigations and claims loss of business and increased legal liability cyberattacks security breaches or thirdparty reports of perceived security vulnerability to our systems even if no breach has occurred also could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation regulatory actions loss of client confidence and increased legal liability we also make acquisitions periodically while significant effort is placed on addressing information technology security issues with respect to the acquired companies we may inherit such risks when these acquisitions are integrated into our infrastructure 

a prolonged or recurring outage at our data centers and other business continuity disruptions at facilities could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

our clients rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data and applications our business is dependent on our ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on our computerbased networks database storage facilities and other network infrastructure which are located across multiple facilities globally if we experience significant growth of our customer base or increases in the number of products or services or in the speed at which we are required to provide products and services it may strain our systems additionally our systems and networks may become strained due to aging or endoflife technology that we have not yet updated or replaced 

our computer operations as well as our other business centers and those of our suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war civil unrest internet failures computer viruses security breaches and other events beyond our reasonable control in addition in the remote work environments the daily activities and productivity of our workforce is now more closely tied to key vendors such as video conferencing services consistently delivering their services without material disruption our ability to deliver information using the internet and to operate in a remote working environment may be impaired because of infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers malicious attacks or other factors 

we also currently use multiple providers of cloud services however one supplier provided the majority of our cloud computing support for the twelve months ended august 31 2022 while we believe this provider to be reliable we have limited control over its performance and a disruption or loss of service from this provider could impair our systems operation and our ability to operate for a period of time we maintain backup facilities and certain other redundancies for each of our major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt those operations however a loss of our services involving our significant facilities may materially disrupt our business and may induce our clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business although we seek to minimize these risks through security measures controls backup data centers and emergency planning there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective additionally we may also face significant increases in our use of power and data storage and may experience a shortage of capacity and increased costs associated with such usage 

transition to new technologies applications and processes could expose us to unanticipated disruptions 

the technology landscape is constantly evolving to remain competitive we must adapt and migrate to new technologies applications and processes use of more advanced technologies and infrastructure is critical to the development of our products 

and services the scaling of our business for future growth and the accurate maintenance of our data and operations the implementation of new technologies and infrastructure such as migration to new cloudbased systems is complex and can involve substantial expenditures as well as risks inherent in the conversion to any new system including potential loss of information and disruption to operations we may experience unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products and services certain of our technologies are also dependent upon thirdparty providers to maintain adequate systems to protect the security of our confidential information and data failure by our providers to maintain appropriate security could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a network disruption that could further lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data regulatory penalties and remedial costs any disruption to either the provider’s systems or the communication links between us and the provider could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems and could impair our ability to provide services to our clients if the services to our clients are disrupted or if there is unauthorized access to the confidential information of our clients or our vendors we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation and lose clients we also may incur increased operating expenses to recover data repair or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from such disruptions as we increase our reliance on thirdparty systems our exposure to damages from services disruptions may increase and we may incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by these disruptions 

use of open source software could introduce security vulnerabilities impose unanticipated restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services and subject us to increased costs 

we use open source code in our software development and incorporate it into our products and internal systems the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality or security of the code some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary applications with the open source software in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage we have implemented procedures to control the use of open source code so as to mitigate this risk however the terms of many open source licenses are also ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts therefore there is a risk that our internal procedures controlling the use of open source code could fail or that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on us if any of this were to occur we could be required to seek alternative thirdparty licenses at increased costs or reduced scope to reengineer products or systems or potentially to discontinue the licensing of certain products any remedial actions could divert resources away from our development efforts be time intensive and have a significant cost 

strategy  market demand risks 

competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products with competitors ranging in size from smaller highly specialized singleproduct businesses to multibilliondollar companies while we believe the breadth and depth of our suite of products and applications offer benefits to our clients that are a competitive advantage our competitors may offer price incentives to attract new business future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues and asv weak economic conditions may also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries we serve could lower demand for our products clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services such as ours if our clients consolidate their spending with fewer suppliers by selecting suppliers with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data our business could be negatively affected 

the continued shift from active to passive investing could negatively impact user count growth and revenues 

the predominant investment strategy today is still active investing which attempts to outperform the market the main advantage of active management is the expectation that the investment managers will be able to outperform market indices they make informed investment decisions based on their experiences insights knowledge and ability to identify opportunities that can translate into superior performance the main advantage of passive investing is that it closely matches the performance of market indices passive investing requires little decisionmaking by investment managers and low operating costs which result in lower fees for the investor a continued shift to passive investing resulting in an increased outflow to passively managed index funds could reduce demand for the services of active investment managers and consequently the demand of our clients for our services 

a decline in equity andor fixed income returns may impact the buying power of investment management clients 

the majority of our asv is derived from our investment management clients and the profitability and management fees of many of these clients are tied to assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses the value of assets under management but also could cause a significant increase in redemption requests from our clients’ customers further reducing their assets under management reduced client profits and management fees may cause our clients to cut costs moreover extended declines in the equity and fixed income markets may reduce new fund or client creation each of these developments may result in lower demand from investment managers for our services and workstations which could negatively affect our business 

uncertainty or downturns in the global economy and consolidation in the financial services industry may cause us to lose clients and users 

many of our clients are investment banks asset managers wealth advisors and other financial services entities uncertainty or downturns in the global economy or a lack of confidence in the global financial system could negatively impact our clients which could cause a corresponding negative impact on our business results mergers consolidation or contraction of our clients in the financial services industry also could directly impact the number of clients and prospective clients and users of our products and services if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our products and services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our products and services thus economic uncertainty economic downturns lack of confidence in the global financial system and consolidation in this sector could adversely affect our business financial results and future growth 

volatility or downturns in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth 

the decision on the part of large institutional clients to purchase our services often requires managementlevel sponsorship and typically depends upon the size of the client with larger clients having more complex and timeconsuming purchasing processes the process is also influenced by market volatility and market downturns these characteristics often lead us to engage in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed as uncertainties or downturns in the financial markets may cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments market volatility or market downturns may curtail our clients spending and lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions or product service implementations or cause them to cancel or reduce their spending with us which could negatively impact our revenues and future growth 

failure to develop and market new products and enhancements that maintain our technological and competitive position and failure to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace for our products and customer demands 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change including methods and speed of delivery changes in client demands development of new investment instruments and evolving industry standards the direction of these trends can render our existing products less competitive obsolete or unmarketable as a result our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to identify and develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices we may not be successful in developing introducing marketing licensing and implementing new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis or without impacting the stability and efficiency of existing products and customer systems further any new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results our failure or inability to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace including competitor and supplier developments may also adversely affect our business operations and growth 

errors or defects can exist at any point in a products life cycle but are more frequently found after the introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products despite internal testing and testing by clients our products may contain errors we may also experience delays while developing and introducing new products for various reasons such as difficulties in licensing data inputs defects errors or delays in our products that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation loss of revenues lower rate of license renewals or upgrades diversion of development resources product liability claims or regulatory actions or increases in service and support costs 

we have provisions in our client contracts to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by clients based on the use of our products or services or our delay or failure to provide services contracts with customers also increasingly include service level requirements and audit rights to review our security many of our customers in the financial services sector are 

also subject to regulations and requirements to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships and provide rigorous oversight of relationships that involve certain critical activities some of which may be deemed to be provided by us any failure on our part to comply with the specific provisions in customer contracts could result in the imposition of various penalties which may include termination of contracts service credits suspension of payments contractual penalties adverse monetary judgments and in the case of government contracts suspension from future government contracting even if the outcome of any claims brought against us were ultimately favorable such a claim would require the time and attention of our management personnel as well as financial and other resources and potentially pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations 

failure to identify integrate or realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions and strains on resources as a result of growth 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices additionally there may be integration risks or other risks resulting from acquired businesses including our acquisition of cgs during fiscal 2022 our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from past and future acquisitions and alliances depends in part upon our ability to integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses effectively into our core business we cannot guarantee that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels anticipated in addition past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt operations 

growth such as the addition of new clients and acquisitions puts demands on our resources including our internal systems and infrastructure these may require improvements or replacement to meet the additional demands of a larger organization further the addition of new clients and the implementation of such improvements would require additional management time and resources these needs may result in increased costs that could negatively impact results of operations failure to implement needed improvements such as improved scalability could result in a deterioration in the performance of our internal systems and negatively impact the performance of our business 

failure to maintain reputation 

we enjoy a positive reputation in the marketplace our ability to attract and retain clients and employees is affected by external perceptions of our brand and reputation reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity including without limitation market perception of our sustainability and corporate responsibility policies and practices could affect our ability to attract and retain clients and employees and our ability to maintain our pricing for our products although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

operational risks 

operations outside the united states involve additional requirements and burdens that we may not be able to control or manage successfully 

in fiscal 2022 approximately 40 of our revenues related to operations located outside the us in addition approximately 79 of our employees are located in offices outside the us we expect our growth to continue outside the us our nonus operations involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our us operations these risks include difficulties in developing products services and technology tailored to the needs of nonus clients including in emerging markets different employment laws and rules rising labor costs in lowerwage countries difficulties in staffing and managing personnel that are located outside the us different regulatory legal and compliance requirements including in the areas of privacy and data protection antibribery and anticorruption trade sanctions and currency controls marketing and sales and other barriers to conducting business social and cultural differences such as language diverse or less stable political operating and economic environments and market fluctuations civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity including the risk that the current conflict between ukraine and russia expands in a way that impacts our business and operations limited recognition of our brand and intellectual property protection differing accounting principles and standards restrictions on or adverse tax consequences from entity management efforts and changes in us or foreign tax laws if we are not able to adapt efficiently or manage the business effectively in markets outside the us our business prospects and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

failure to enter into renew or comply with contracts supplying new and existing data sets or products on competitive terms 

we collect and aggregate thirdparty content from data suppliers news sources exchanges brokers and contributors into our own dedicated online service which clients access to perform their analyses we combine the data from these sources into our own dedicated databases clients have access to the data and content found within our databases these databases are important to our operations as they provide clients with key information we have entered into thirdparty content agreements of varying 

lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice some of our content provider agreements are with competitors who may attempt to make renewals difficult or expensive we seek to maintain favorable contractual relationships with our data suppliers including those that are also competitors however we cannot control the actions and policies of our data suppliers and we may have data suppliers who provide us with notice of termination or exclude or restrict us from use of their content or only license such content at prohibitive cost additionally despite our efforts to comply with our thirdparty data supplier agreements there can be no assurances that third parties may not challenge our use of their content which could result in increased licensing costs loss of rights and costly legal actions certain data sets that we rely on have a limited number of suppliers although we make every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available we are not dependent on any one thirdparty data supplier in order to meet the needs of our clients with only two data suppliers each representing more than 10 of our total data costs for the twelve months ended august 31 2022 our failure to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of our suppliers to deliver accurate data or in a timely manner or the occurrence of a dispute with a vendor over use of their content could increase our costs and reduce the type of content and products available to our clients which could harm our reputation in the marketplace and adversely affect our business 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products 

each year an increasing amount of free or relatively inexpensive information becomes available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products while we believe our service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other valueadded factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources our business results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

inability to hire and retain key qualified personnel 

our business is based on successfully attracting motivating and retaining talented and diverse employees creating a diverse and inclusive environment that promotes empowerment and engagement is key to our ability to attract retain and develop talent competition for talent especially engineering personnel is strong we need technical resources such as engineers to help develop new products and enhance existing services we rely upon sales personnel to sell our products and services and maintain healthy business relationships our future success also is dependent on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team all of these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace if we are unsuccessful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the covid19 pandemic and other global public health epidemics may adversely impact our business our future results of operations and our overall financial performance 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risk or the public perception of risk related to a pandemic or widespread health crisis such as the covid19 pandemic a significant outbreak epidemic or pandemic of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis adversely affecting the broader economies financial markets and overall demand for our products in addition any preventative or protective actions that governments implement or that we take in respect of a global health crisis such as travel restrictions quarantines or site closures may interfere with the ability of our employees vendors and data suppliers to perform their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business including our ability to gather content such results could have a material adverse effect on our operations business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

to date the covid19 pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows however due to the ongoing uncertainty related to the duration magnitude and impact of the pandemic it may still have a substantial negative impact on our employees or vendors productivity which could result in our operations including our ability to gather content suffering and in turn our results of operations cash flows and overall financial performance being impacted negatively furthermore if our employees incur substantial medical expenses due to covid19 our expenses may increase due to our selffunded employee medical insurance model our management is focused on mitigating the effects of covid19 on our business which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of their time and may delay their other efforts the continued impact of covid19 may also increase the severity or likelihood of the other risks described in this item any of which could have a material effect on us given the dynamic nature of these circumstances the extent to which our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows are affected by covid19 will depend in part on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain the impact of the covid19 pandemic depends upon various uncertainties including the geographic spread of the virus the severity of the virus the duration of the outbreak and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the virus if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business and financial condition could be negatively impacted refer to item 

7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  covid19 update for additional information 

legal  regulatory risks 

legislative and regulatory changes in the environments in which we and our clients operate 

as a business we are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the us and in the other countries in which we operate these laws rules and regulations and their interpretations may change in the future or conflict and compliance with these changes may increase our costs or cause us to make changes in or otherwise limit our business practices in addition the global nature and scope of our business operations make it more difficult to monitor areas that may be subject to regulatory and compliance risk if we fail to comply with any applicable law rule or regulation we could be subject to claims and fines and suffer reputational damage uncertainty caused by political change globally and complex relationships across countries including the us and nations in europe and asia heightens the risk of regulatory uncertainty 

many of our clients operate within a highly regulated environment and must comply with governmental legislation and regulations the us regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry increased regulation of our clients may increase their expenses causing them to seek to limit or reduce their costs from outside services such as ours additionally if our clients are subjected to investigations or legal proceedings they may be adversely impacted possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reduction in assets under management or diminished operations which would adversely affect our revenues recent regulatory changes that we believe might materially impact us and our clients include 

mifid 

in the european union eu the markets in financial instruments directive recast mifid ii became effective in january 2018 in the united kingdom uk laws and regulations implementing mifid ii were modified to transpose aspects of eu law and address deficiencies that would have otherwise been created as a result of the uks withdrawal from the eu we believe that compliance with mifid ii requirements is timeconsuming and costly for investment managers who are subject to it and may cause clients to adapt their pricing models and business practices significantly these increased costs may impact our clients’ spending and may cause some investment managers to lose business or withdraw from the market which may adversely affect demand for our services however mifid ii may also present us with new business opportunities for new service offerings in may 2022 the uk government announced the new financial services and markets bill fsm bill which would reform financial service regulation in the uk and represent a divergence from the existing uk mifid regime there is no set timescale as to when passage of the fsm bill would occur this regulatory reform may impact some of our ukregulated clients and may require them to devote more resources towards realigning their compliance measures and in some cases ensuring compliance with both the uk and eu regimes we continue to monitor and work with our clients to navigate through the impact of uk regulatory change and of mifid ii on the investment process and trade lifecycle 

brexit 

on january 31 2020 the uk formally left the eu on january 1 2021 the uk left the eu single market and customs union as well as all eu policies and international agreements resulting in two separate markets in the eu and the uk on december 24 2020 the eu reached a trade agreement with the uk the trade agreement the trade agreement offers uk and eu companies preferential access to each others markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas however economic relations between the uk and eu will now be on more restricted terms than existed previously the trade agreement does not incorporate the full scope of the services sector and businesses such as banking and finance face uncertainty in march 2021 the uk and eu had agreed on a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation and dialogue on financial services issues between the two countries in a memorandum of understanding the mou which is expected to be signed after formal steps are completed although this has not yet occurred in june 2022 following an inquiry the european affairs committee issued a report which concluded that while the outlook for financial services after brexit seems relatively positive the impact of brexit on financial services would be dependent on political decisions made by the uk and the eu at this time we cannot predict the impact that the trade agreement the mou or any future agreements on services particularly financial services will have on our business and our clients it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results we continue to evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit and partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets this uncertainty may have an impact on our clients’ expansion or spending plans which may in turn negatively impact our revenue or growth the eu commission has adopted adequacy decisions which will allow personal data to continue to move freely between the eu and the uk until june 27 2025 while these adequacy decisions have created some certainty for our clients we will continue to monitor developments which may impact their future validity and extension 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations 

we are party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation and governmental investigations can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings  of this annual report on form 10k 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights or may infringe upon our intellectual property rights 

we may receive notice from others claiming that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur litigation costs enter into settlements stop selling or redesign affected products or pay damages and satisfy indemnification commitments with our clients or suppliers under contractual provisions of various license arrangements additionally third parties may copy infringe or otherwise profit from the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights requiring us to litigate to protect our rights certain countries may not offer adequate protection of proprietary rights if we are required to defend ourselves or assert our rights or take such actions mentioned our operating margins may decline as a result we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

additional cost due to tax assessments resulting from ongoing and future audits by tax authorities as well as changes in tax laws 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to changes in tax laws as well as tax examinations by various governmental tax authorities the global and diverse nature of our business means that there could be additional examinations by governmental tax au thorities and the resolution of ongoing and other probable audits which could impose a future risk to the results of our business in august 2019 and july 2021 we received notices of intent to assess the notices additional salesuse taxes interest and underpayment penalties from the commonwealth of massachusetts department of revenue relating to prior tax periods based upon a review of the notices we believe the commonwealth may assess salesuse tax interest and underpayment penalties on previously recorded sales transactions we filed an appeal to the notices and we intend to contest any such assessment if assessed and continue to cooperate with the commonwealth’s inquiry further on august 10 2021 we received a letter the letter from the commonwealth relating to additional prior tax periods requesting sales information to determine if a notice of intent to assess should be issued to factset with respect to these tax periods based upon a preliminary review of the letter we believe the commonwealth might seek to assess salesuse tax interest and underpayment penalties on previously recorded sales transactions 

as of august 31 2022 we have concluded that a payment to the commonwealth is probable we recorded an accrual which is not material to our consolidated financial statements while we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the accrual are reasonable future developments could result in adjustments being made to this accrual if we are presented with a formal assessment for any of these matters we believe that we will ultimately prevail however if we do not prevail the amount of any assessment could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

changes in tax laws or the terms of tax treaties in a jurisdiction where we are subject to tax could have an impact on our taxes payable 

financial market risks 

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the failure of hedging arrangements 

due to the global nature of our operations we conduct business outside the us in several currencies our primary currency exposures include the british pound sterling euro indian rupee and philippine peso to the extent our international activities increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may increase as well to manage this exposure we utilize derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings with changes in foreign currency although we believe 

that our foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances our attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful which could cause an adverse impact on both our results of operations and cash flows 

business performance may not be sufficient to meet financial guidance or publicly disclosed longterm targets 

we provide public fullyear financial guidance based upon assumptions regarding our expected financial performance including our ability to grow revenues and organic asv plus professional services to meet our planned expenses and maintain a certain tax rate and our ability to achieve our profitability targets we can provide no assurances that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past or that our growth strategies will be successful if we are unable to successfully execute on our strategies to achieve our growth objectives and retain our existing clients or if we experience higher than expected operating costs or taxes we risk not meeting our fullyear financial guidance or may find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year 

economic political and market forces beyond our control could adversely affect our business 

our costs and the demand for our products may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control negative conditions in the general economy in either the united states or abroad including conditions resulting from financial and credit market fluctuations changes in economic policy inflation rate fluctuations and trade uncertainty including changes in tariffs sanctions international treaties and other trade restrictions could result in an increase in our costs andor a reduction in demand for our products which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks relating to the cgs transaction 

we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the cgs transaction 

the success of our acquisition of the cgs business the cgs business will depend on among other things our ability to incorporate the cgs business into our business in a manner that enhances our value proposition to clients and facilitates other growth opportunities we must successfully include the cgs business within our business in a manner that permits these growth opportunities to be realized in addition we must achieve the growth opportunities without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in other future growth if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of cgs the cgs transaction may not be realized fully if at all or may take longer to realize than expected additionally management may face challenges in incorporating certain elements and functions of the cgs business with the factset business and this process may result in additional and unforeseen expenses the cgs transaction may also disrupt the cgs business’s and factset’s ongoing business or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with thirdparty partners employees suppliers customers and others with whom the cgs business and factset have business or other dealings or limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the cgs transaction it is possible that our experience in operating the cgs business will require us to adjust our expectations regarding the impact of the cgs transaction on our operating results if we are not able to successfully add the cgs business to the existing factset business in an efficient effective and timely manner anticipated benefits including the opportunities for growth we expect from the cgs transaction may not be realized fully if at all or may take longer to realize than expected and our cash flow and financial condition may be negatively affected 

we have incurred and may incur additional significant transaction costs in connection with the cgs transaction 

we have incurred a number of nonrecurring costs associated with the cgs transaction these costs and expenses include financial advisory legal accounting consulting and other advisory fees and expenses filing fees and other related charges there is also a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the cgs transaction while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the cgs transaction and related transactions there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses there may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the cgs transaction that we may not recoup these costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and additional income we expect to achieve from the cgs transaction although we expect that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all 

risks relating to our debt 

our indebtedness may impair our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the senior notes and our other debt instruments 

as of august 31 2022 giving effect to the issuance of the senior notes and the incurrence of borrowings under the 2022 credit facilities and the repayment of the 2019 revolving credit facility our total outstanding principal amount of debt was 20 

billion none of which is secured under the 2022 revolving facility we have 2500 million of unused commitments and an option to increase the size of the facility by an additional 7500 million refer to note 12 debt for definitions of these terms and more information on the senior notes 2022 credit facilities and 2019 revolving credit facility 

our indebtedness could have important consequences to investors including 

a making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations 

b limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements execution of our growth strategy and other purposes 

c requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our debt and scheduled amortization on the 2022 term facility which would reduce availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions execution of our strategy and other general corporate purposes 

d making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic industry and government regulations and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to changing conditions 

e placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with those of our competitors that have less debt and 

f exposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because some of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in market interest rates 

in addition we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs if we are not able to pay our debts as they become due we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies such as selling assets refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities we may not be able to refinance our debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or our assets on favorable terms if at all and if we must sell our assets it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenues 

despite current indebtedness levels we may still incur more debt the incurrence of additional debt could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness 

subject to certain limitations the 2022 credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes permit us and our subsidiaries to incur additional debt if new debt is added to our or any such subsidiary’s current debt levels the risks described above in the previous risk factor could intensify 

the restrictive covenants in our debt may affect our ability to operate our business successfully 

the 2022 credit agreement contains and our future debt instruments may contain various provisions that limit our ability to among other things incur liens incur additional indebtedness guarantees or other contingent obligations enter into sale and leaseback transactions engage in mergers and consolidations make investments and acquisitions change the nature of our business and make sales transfers and other dispositions of property and assets the indenture governing the senior notes also contains various provisions that limit our ability to among other things incur liens enter into sale and leaseback transactions engage in mergers and consolidations and make sales transfers and other dispositions of property and assets these covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities 

in addition the 2022 credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests events beyond our control including changes in general economic and business conditions may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants or any other restrictive covenants contained in the definitive documentation governing our indebtedness would result in a default or an event of default if an event of default in respect of any of our indebtedness occurs the holders of the affected indebtedness could declare all amounts outstanding together with accrued interest to be immediately due and payable which in turn could cause the default and acceleration of the maturity of our other indebtedness we expect we will be permitted to incur substantial amounts of secured debt under the covenants in the indenture governing the senior notes and the 2022 credit facilities if upon an acceleration we were unable to pay amounts owed in respect of any such indebtedness secured by liens on our assets then the lenders of such indebtedness could proceed against the collateral pledged to them 

certain of our borrowings and other obligations are based upon variable rates of interest which could result in higher expense in the event of increases in interest rates 

the 2022 credit agreement provides that i loans denominated in us dollars at our option will bear interest at either the onemonth term secured overnight financing rate sofr with a 01 credit spread adjustment and subject to a zero floor ii the daily simple sofr with a 01 credit spread adjustment and subject to a zero floor or iii an alternate base 

rate under the 2022 credit agreement loans denominated in pounds sterling will bear interest at the daily simple sterling overnight index average sonia subject to a zero floor and loans denominated in euros will bear interest at the euro interbank offered rate euribor subject to a zero floor in each case plus an applicable interest rate margin the interest rate margin will fluctuate based upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating and our total leverage ratio an increase in the alternate base rate term sofr daily simple sofr sonia or euribor would increase our interest payment obligations under the 2022 credit facilities and could have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition 

to mitigate this exposure on march 1 2022 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the variable interest rate obligation on a portion of our outstanding balance under the 2022 credit facilities  however as the interest rate swap agreement covers only a portion of our outstanding balance under the 2022 credit facilities  a substantial portion of our outstanding balance under the 2022 credit facilities continues to be exposed to interest rate volatility an increase in the applicable rates would increase our interest payment obligations under the 2022 credit facilities and could have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition

operating income for the fiscal year 2022 increased 03 compared with the prior year period operating margin decreased in fiscal 2022 to 258 compared with 298 for fiscal 2021 operating margin decreased primarily due to impairment charges related to vacating certain leased office space and higher amortization of intangible assets primarily from the cgs acquisition partially offset by growth in revenues and lower employee compensation expense when expressed as a percentage of revenue diluted earnings per share eps decreased 11 compared with the prior year 

our clients and users reached new highs of 7538 and 179982 respectively in fiscal 2022 we returned 1446 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends paid during fiscal 2022

the purchase price for the cgs acquisition was financed from the net proceeds of the issuance of the senior notes and borrowings under the 2022 credit facilities refer to note 6 acquisitions and note 12 debt for more information on these defined terms as well as our acquisition of cgs the senior notes and the 2022 credit facilities 

covid19 update 

a novel strain of coronavirus now known as covid19 covid19 was first reported in december 2019 with the world health organization characterizing covid19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 in r esponse to the covid19 pandemic we implemented a business continuity plan with a dedicated incident management team to respond quickly and provide ongoing guidance so that we could continue offering our clients uninterrupted products services and support while also protecting our employees we believe these actions have been successful and that the pandemic and our responses have not significantly affected our financial results during fiscal 2022  

at the outset of the pandemic we required the vast majority of our employees at our offices across the globe including our corporate headquarters to work remotely and implemented global travel restrictions for our employees since that time we have reopened our offices globally with a focus on safety while acting consistently with applicable local regulations as of august 31 2022 there have been minimal interruptions in our ability to provide our products services and support to our clients working remotely has had relatively little impact on the productivity of our employees including our ability to gather content based on our success working in a remote environment during the covid19 pandemic we have implemented a new work standard under which employees in many of our locations where permitted by local laws and regulations and where the role permits have the opportunity to choose between different work arrangements these include working in a hybrid arrangement where an employee can split time between working from the office and working from a preapproved remote location or a fully remote arrangement where an employee can work entirely from a preapproved remote location 

our revenues earnings and asv are relatively stable and predictable as a result of our subscriptionbased business model to date the covid19 pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our revenues earnings or asv as we continue to work in remote and hybrid environments reductions in discretionary spending particularly travel and entertainment have more than offset any related increased expenses given our transition to our new work standard we anticipate that many of these 

expense reductions will continue going forward including incurring less travel and entertainment spending than we did prepandemic we also reassessed our real estate footprint in light of these new work arrangements and have exited office space that we believe will no longer be necessary for the year ended as of august 31 2022 we recognized 622 million in impairment charges related to vacating certain leased office space to resize our real estate footprint for the hybrid work environment while we will continue to evaluate our real estate needs we expect that this initiative is largely complete and we do not currently anticipate additional similar lysized real estate impairment charges as part of the reduction of our real estate footprint

ukrainerussia conflict 

as the ongoing military conflict between russia and ukraine continues we are closely monitoring the current and potential impact on our business our people and our clients we have taken all necessary steps to ensure compliance with all applicable regulatory restrictions on international trade and financial transactions we have discontinued all commercial operations and delivery of products and services to clients inside russia have terminated all contracts with vendors in russia and have suspended all new business trials and prospecting activities in russia total revenues associated with clients in russia were not material to our consolidated financial results and termination of russian vendors has not had a material impact on our business or client relationships we have no offices in russia or ukraine and none of our employees or contractors has been directly impacted by the crisis we are monitoring the regional and global ramifications of the events in the area are in close contact with our office in latvia and are reviewing our business continuity plans to ensure that we are prepared in the event this office is impacted our cybersecurity teams are ready to respond in the event of any attempted systems compromise 

annual subscription value asv 

we believe asv reflects our ability to grow recurring revenues and generate positive cash flow and is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy 

– asv at any point in time represents our forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients excluding revenues from professional services 

– organic asv at any point in time equals our asv excluding asv from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency movements on the current year period 

– professional services are revenues derived from projectbased consulting and implementation annualized over the past 12 months 

– organic asv plus professional services at any point in time equals the sum of organic asv and professional services 

organic asv plus professional services 

the following table presents the calculation of organic asv plus professional services as of august 31 2022 with proper notice provided as contractually required our clients can add to delete portions of or terminate service subject to certain limitations

as of august 31 2022 organic asv plus professional services was 18 billion an increase of 93 compared with august 31 2021 the increase in yearoveryear organic asv was largely attributable to increased sales to existing clients followed by new client sales and existing client price increases partially offset by existing client cancellations 

organic asv increased across all our geographic segments with the majority of the increase related to the americas followed by emea and asia pacific this increase was driven by additional sales in our workflow solutions primarily in research  advisory and analytics  trading followed by cts sales increased in research  advisory mainly due to higher demand for our workstations sales increased in analytics  trading mainly from our performance and reporting products portfolio analytics solutions and portfolio and benchmark services cts sales increased primarily due to purchases of company financial data such as fundamentals estimates and ownership along with data management solutions to empower data connectivity 

segment asv 

as of august 31 2022 asv from the americas represented 64 of total asv and was 12624 million an increase from 10394 million as of august 31 2021 americas organic asv increased to 11353 million as of august 31 2022 a 93 increase compared with august 31 2021

the increased organic asv in the americas was primarily driven by increased sales of research  advisory and analytics  trading the emea organic asv increase was mainly driven by higher sales of research  advisory analytics  trading and cts the asia pacific organic asv increase was primarily due to increased sales of analytics  trading and research  advisory 

buyside and sellside organic asv growth 

the buyside and sellside organic asv growth rates at august 31 2022 compared with august 31 2021 were 85 and 138 respectively buyside clients account for approximately 83 of our organic asv consistent with the prior year period and primarily include asset managers wealth managers asset owners channel partners hedge funds and corporate firms the remainder of our organic asv is derived from sellside firms and primarily include brokerdealers banking and advisory private equity and venture capital firms 

client and user additions 

the table below presents our total clients and users

our total client count was 7538 as of august 31 2022 a net increase of 168 or 1085 clients in the last 12 months mainly due to an increase in corporate clients wealth management clients and private equity and venture capital firms we believe this increase is primarily due to our continued focus on our on and offplatform workflowfocused solutions connected content and clientfocused services 

as of august 31 2022 there were 179982 professionals using factset representing a net increase of 118 or 19050 users in the last 12 months primarily driven by an increase in wealth advisory professionals from our wealth management clients as well as an increase in sellside users from our banking clients the increase in users was mainly due to new wealth management clients improvement in our client retention and increased new hiring at our banking clients 

annual asv retention was greater than 95 of asv for the period ended august 31 2022 and august 31 2021 when expressed as a percentage of clients annual retention was approximately 92 for the period ended august 31 2022 an improvement from approximately 91 for the period ended august 31 2021 

employee headcount 

as of august 31 2022 our employee headcount was 11203 an increase of 29 compared with 10892 employees as of august 31 2021 this growth in headcount was due to an increase in net new employees of 45 in asia pacific and 21 in emea partially offset by a decrease of 16 in the americas at august 31 2022 7401 employees were located in asia pacific 2400 in the americas and 1402 in emea 

results of operations 

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during fiscal 2022 and 2021 the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the periods described 



revenues 

revenues in fiscal 2022 was 18 billion an increase of 159 compared to the prior year this increase in revenues was largely attributed to increased sales to existing clients new client sales and existing client price increases partially offset by existing client cancellations revenues increased across all our segments primarily from the americas followed by emea and asia pacific driven by increased revenues in all our workflow solutions mainly in cts followed by research  advisory and analytics  trading compared with the prior year organic revenues increased to 17 billion for the fiscal year ended 2022 a 98 increase over the prior year period refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nongaap financial measures of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion on organic revenues 

the growth in revenues of 159 was reflective of organic revenues growth of 98 and a 66 increase primarily due to the impact of acquisitionrelated revenues partially offset by a 05 decrease from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

revenues by segment

income taxes 



our effective tax rate is based on recurring factors and nonrecurring events including the taxation of foreign income our effective tax rate will vary based on among other things changes in levels of foreign income as well as discrete and other nonrecurring events that may not be predictable our effective tax rate is lower than the applicable us corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2022 driven mainly by research and development rd tax credits a foreign derived intangible income fdii deduction and a tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 

the fiscal 2022 provision for income taxes decreased 314 to 467 million compared with 680 million in fiscal 2021 this decrease was primarily driven by lower pretax income and 117 million in higher tax benefits from the exercise of stock options for fiscal 2022 compared with the prior year period 

net income and diluted earnings per share 



net income decreased 07 to 3969 million and diluted eps decreased 11 to 1025 for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 net income and diluted eps decreased primarily due to an increase in operating expenses and interest expense related to our debt refinancing partially offset by higher revenues and a reduction in the provision for income taxes compared with the prior year period diluted eps also decreased due to a 02 million increase in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding 

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we use nongaap financial measures including organic revenues adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted diluted eps the reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are show in the tables below these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to financial measures reported in accordance with gaap moreover these nongaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in 

accordance with gaap other companies may calculate similarly titled nongaap financial measures differently that we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes 

despite the limitations of these nongaap financial measures we believe these adjusted financial measures and the information they provide are useful in viewing our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals adjusted measures may also facilitate comparisons to our historical performance 

organic revenues exclude revenue related to acquisitions and dispositions completed in the last 12 months the amortization of deferred revenues fair value adjustments from purchase accounting related to acquisitions prior to fiscal 2022 and the impacts of foreign currency movements on the current year period acquisitions during fiscal 2022 were accounted for in accordance with our adoption of asu no 202108 as such the deferred revenues did not include a fair value adjustment refer to note 2 significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on asu no 202108

the table below provides an unaudited reconciliation of operating income operating margin net income and diluted eps to adjusted operating income adjusted operating margin adjusted net income ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted diluted eps 

1 adjusted operating margin is calculated as adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenues as shown in the organic revenue table above

3 for purposes of calculating adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share adjustments were taxed at the annual effective tax rates of 123 for fiscal 2022 and 178 for fiscal 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

our cash flows provided by operating activities existing cash and cash equivalents supplemented with our longterm debt borrowings have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the longterm growth of our operations generally some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to among other things service our existing and future debt obligations satisfy our working capital requirements and fund our capital expenditures investments acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock based on past performance and current expectations we believe our sources of liquidity including the available capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and other financing alternatives will provide us the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future

operating 

for fiscal 2022 net cash provided by operating activities was 5383 million compared with 5552 million for fiscal 2021 a decrease of 169 million this decrease was primarily driven by the timing of tax payments in certain jurisdictions and higher accounts receivable due to increased sales and an increase in days sales outstanding

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property equipment leasehold improvements and capitalized internal use software we believe free cash flow is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that after capital expenditures can be used for strategic opportunities including returning value to shareholders investing in our business making strategic acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 

the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 

1 capital expenditures are included in net cash used in investing activities during each fiscal period reported and include property equipment leasehold improvements and capitalized internaluse software 

during fiscal 2022 we generated free cash flow of 4871 million compared with 4939 million in fiscal 2021 this decrease of 68 million was primarily due to a 169 million decrease in operating cash flows partially offset by a 102 million decrease in capital expenditures the operating cash flows decrease was primarily driven by the timing of tax payments in certain jurisdictions and an increase in days sales outstanding capital expenditures decreased primarily due to costs incurred for the buildout of our office space in the philippines during fiscal 2021 partially offset by higher peripherals for our office space primarily in india during fiscal 2022

during fiscal 2022 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations net of hedge activity decreased operating income by 31 million compared with a 54 million decrease to operating income in the prior year the current foreign currency forward contracts are set to mature at various points between the first quarter of fiscal 2023 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 a loss on foreign currency forward contracts of 79 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2022 compared with a gain of 50 million in fiscal 2021

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations research and development rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements the tax benefit from stock option exercises and the foreign derived intangible income fdii tax deduction 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

to account for unrecognized tax benefits we first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than 50 that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority the determination of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits including associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits however we have no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes andor penalties that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position beyond current estimates for this reason and due to ongoing audits by multiple tax authorities we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made we do not currently anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months 

we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws this interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements 

refer to note 10 income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

stockbased compensation 

we measure compensation expense for all stockbased awards made to our employees and board of directors nonemployees using the blackscholes model or the latticebinomialoption pricing model to estimate the grantdate fair value both models involve certain estimates and subjective assumptions regarding our stock price volatility the expected life of the award the term selected for the riskfree rate and the exp ected dividend yield the binomial model also incorporates market conditions vesting restrictions and exercise patterns 

our performancebased equity awards require management to make assumptions regarding the probability of achieving the relevant performance condition which is reviewed on a quarterly basis the number of performancebased awards that vest will be predicated on achieving performance levels during the measurement period subsequent to the date of grant 

we estimate expected forfeitures of equity awards at the date of grant and recognize compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest the forfeiture assumption is revised if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 

the assumptions we use to calculate and account for stockbased compensation awards represent managements best estimates which involve inherent uncertainties as a result if we revise our assumptions and estimates our stockbased compensation expense could differ from amounts recorded refer to note 16  stockbased compensation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units on the date of acquisition our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life we test our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any one of our reporting units below its respective carrying amount 

we may elect to perform a qualitative analysis for the reporting units to determine whether it is more likely a likelihood of more than 50 than not the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value in performing a qualitative assessment we consider such factors as macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions in which we operate including the competitive environment and significant changes in demand for our services we also consider the share price both in absolute terms and in relation to peer companies if the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative analysis a quantitative analysis is performed to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists 

the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount of a reporting unit with its fair value by applying the income approach utilizing the discounted cash flow method along with other relevant market information an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value if any would be recognized the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

our identifiable intangible assets are classified as an aba business process client relationships software technology developed technology acquired databases data content and trade names resulting from acquisitions or capitalization of costs related to onpremises internaluse software we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which are evaluated annually to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 

intangible assets are tested for impairment qualitatively on a quarterly basis an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset significant judgment is involved in determining the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows if it is determined that the intangible asset is not recoverable the impairment loss would be calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value 

refer to note 8 goodwill and note 9 intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details 

business combinations 

we account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the underlying identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill and assigned to one or more reporting units the amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisitionrelated tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the expected useful life requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items acquisitionrelated expenses and restructuring costs if any are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred 

longlived assets 

we perform a qualitative review on a quarterly basis of our longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability we use our best estimate of future cash flows undiscounted and excluding interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such assets carrying value exceeds its fair value based on the most appropriate valuation technique including discounted cash flows 

in determining indicators for impairment we take various factors into account including but not limited to a significant decline in our expected future cash flows changes in expected useful life unanticipated competition slower growth rates ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets or changes in the usage or operating performance a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred and in calculating the inputs to the impairment calculation such as estimates related to future cash flows and asset fair values forecasting asset useful lives and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions included in our impairment assessment we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

refer to note 7 property equipment and leasehold improvements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and litigation that have arisen in the ordinary course of business which involve inherent uncertainties assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment if actual results differ from our assessments our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be affected 

new accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 2 significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations current market events have not required us to modify materially or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to foreign currency exchange risk or interest rate risk 

foreign currency transaction risk 

we operate on a global basis and are exposed to the risk that our financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates to mitigate the volatility and uncertainty of our exchange rate risk we entered into foreign currency forward contracts with major institutions related to our primary currencies of the british pound sterling euro indian rupee and philippine peso these forward contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transaction exposure ranging from 25 to 75 over the hedge term we do not enter into cash flow hedges for trading or speculative purposes 

the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings 

during fiscal 2022 we recognized a loss on foreign currency forward contracts of 79 million compared with a gain of 50 million in fiscal 2021 during fiscal 2022 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations net of hedge activity decreased operating income by 31 million compared with a decrease of 54 million in fiscal 2021 

as of august 31 2022  a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar would have increased the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts by  145 million if we had no hedges in place as of august 31 2022  with operating results and exchange rates held constant in local currency the same hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies would have resulted in a decrease in operating income by 390 million 

refer to note 5 derivative instruments in t he notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on our foreign currency exposures and our foreign currency forward contracts 

foreign currency translation 

we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation of our results from certain international operations into us dollars as part of the consolidation process fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can create volatility in the results of operations and our financial condition we recorded a translation loss of 747 million and a gain of 08 million in aocl for the years ended august 31 2022 and 2021 respectively 

interest rate risk 

cash and cash equivalents and investments 

as of august 31 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of 5033 million and investments of 332 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments including demand deposits and money market funds and our investments consist of mutual funds we are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments as we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low refer to note 2 significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on our cash and cash equivalents 

debt 

2022 credit agreement 

on march 1 2022 we borrowed 10 billion under the 2022 term facility and 2500 million of the available 5000 million under the 2022 revolving facility as of august 31 2022 we had an outstanding principal balance of 7500 million under the 2022 term facility and 2500 million under the 2022 revolving facility the outstanding borrowings under the 2022 credit facilities bore interest at rates equal to the applicable onemonth term sofr rate plus a 11 spread comprised of a 10 interest rate margin based on a debt leverage pricing grid plus 01 credit spread adjustment the spread remained consistent through august 31 2022 

the variable rate of interest on our debt creates exposure to interest rate volatility due to changes in sofr to mitigate this risk on march 1 2022 we entered into the 2022 swap agreement with a notional amount of 8000 million to hedge a portion of our sofr rate debt with a fixed interest rate of 1162 the notional amount of the 2022 swap agreement declines by 

1000 million on a quarterly basis as of may 31 2022 and is maturing on february 28 2024  as of august 31 2022 the notional amount was 6000 million 

thus our exposure is limited to fluctuations in sofr related to our outstanding sofr borrowings in excess of amounts not hedged or 4000 million of our outstanding principal balance assuming all terms of our outstanding longterm debt remained the same a hypothetical 25 basis point change up or down in the onemonth sofr would result in a 10 million change to our annual interest expense 

refer to note 12 debt for more information on our outstanding borrowings as of august 31 2022

technology  data security risks 

loss corruption and misappropriation of data and information relating to clients and others 

many of our products as well as our internal systems and processes involve the collection retrieval processing storage and transmission through a variety of media channels of our own as well as supplier and customer proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data we rely on and continuously invest in a complex system of internal processes and controls along with policies procedures and training designed to protect data that we receive in the ordinary course of business including information from client portfolios and strategies however these measures do not guarantee security and improper access to or release of confidential information may still occur through for example employee error or malfeasance system error other inadvertent release failure to properly purge and protect data or cyberattack additionally the maintenance and enhancement of our systems may not be completely effective in preventing loss unauthorized access or misappropriation data misappropriation unauthorized access or data loss could instill a lack of confidence in our products and systems and damage our brand reputation and business breaches of security measures could expose us our clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for us as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and suppliers many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy and protection of personal information including the european union general data protection regulation which became effective may 25 2018 californias consumer privacy act which became effective january 1 2020 and chinas personal information protection law which becomes effective november 1 2021 these laws contain requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including our use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves the law in this area continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws could impact our processing of personal and sensitive information related to our content operations employees clients and suppliers and may expose us to claims of violations 

successful prohibited data access and other cyberattacks and the failure of cybersecurity systems and procedures 

in providing our digitalenabled services to clients we rely on information technology infrastructure that is managed internally along with placing reliance on thirdparty service providers for critical functions we and these thirdparty service providers are subject to the risks of system failures and security breaches including cyberattacks including those sponsored by nationstates terrorist organizations or global corporations seeking to illicitly obtain technology or other intellectual property such as phishing scams hacking viruses denials of service attacks tampering intrusions physical breakins ransomware and malware as well as employee errors or malfeasance in some cases these risks might be heightened when employees are working remotely our and our vendors use of mobile and cloud technologies may increase our risk for such threats our protective systems and procedures and those of third parties to which we are connected such as cloud computing providers may not be effective against these threats our information technology systems must be constantly updated and patched to protect against known vulnerabilities and to optimize performance while we have dedicated resources responsible for maintaining appropriate levels of cybersecurity and implemented systems and processes intended to help identify cyberattacks and protect and remediate our network infrastructure we are aware that these attacks have become increasingly frequent sophisticated and difficult to 

table of contents 

detect and as a result we may not be able to anticipate prevent or detect all such attacks we also may be impacted by a cyberattack targeting one of our vendors or within our technology supply chain or infrastructure our contracts with service providers typically require them to implement and maintain adequate security controls but we may not have the ability to effectively monitor these security measures as a result inadequacies of the thirdparty security technologies and practices may not be detected until after a security breach has occurred these risks may be heightened in connection with employees working from remote work environments as our dependency on certain service providers such as video conferencing and web conferencing services has significantly increased in addition to access our network products and services customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own security risk we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of clients’ or suppliers’ data other external data internal data or information technology systems if the services provided to clients were disrupted or if products or services were perceived as having security vulnerabilities the costs we would incur to address and resolve these security incidents would increase our expenses these types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits regulatory investigations and claims loss of business and increased legal liability cyberattacks security breaches or thirdparty reports of perceived security vulnerability to our systems even if no breach has occurred also could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation regulatory actions loss of client confidence and increased legal liability we also make acquisitions periodically while significant effort is placed on addressing information technology security issues with respect to the acquired companies we may inherit such risks when these acquisitions are integrated into our infrastructure 

a prolonged or recurring outage at our data centers and other business continuity disruptions at facilities could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

our clients rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data and applications our business is dependent on our ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on our computerbased networks database storage facilities and other network infrastructure which are located across multiple facilities globally if we experience significant growth of our customer base or increases in the number of products or services or in the speed at which we are required to provide products and services it may strain our systems additionally our systems and networks may become strained due to aging or endoflife technology that we have not yet updated or replaced our computer operations as well as our other business centers and those of our suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war civil unrest internet failures computer viruses security breaches and other events beyond our reasonable control in addition in the remote work environments the daily activities and productivity of our workforce is now more closely tied to key vendors such as video conferencing services consistently delivering their services without material disruption our ability to deliver information using the internet and to operate in a remote working environment may be impaired because of infrastructure failures service outages at thirdparty internet providers malicious attacks or other factors we maintain backup facilities and certain other redundancies for each of our major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt those operations however a loss of our services involving our significant facilities may materially disrupt our business and may induce our clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business although we seek to minimize these risks through security measures controls backup data centers and emergency planning there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective additionally we may also face significant increases in our use of power and data storage and may experience a shortage of capacity and increased costs associated with such usage 

transition to new technologies applications and processes could expose us to unanticipated disruptions 

the technology landscape is constantly evolving to remain competitive we must adapt and migrate to new technologies applications and processes use of more advanced technologies and infrastructure is critical to the development of our products and services the scaling of our business for future growth and the accurate maintenance of our data and operations the implementation of new technologies and infrastructure such as migration to new cloudbased systems is complex and can involve substantial expenditures as well as risks inherent in the conversion to any new system including potential loss of information and disruption to operations we may experience unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products and services certain of our technologies are also dependent upon thirdparty providers to maintain adequate systems to protect the security of our confidential information and data failure by our providers to maintain appropriate security could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a network disruption that could further lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data regulatory penalties and remedial costs any disruption to either the provider’s systems or the communication links between us and the provider could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems and could impair our ability to provide services to our clients if the services to our clients are disrupted or if there is unauthorized access to the confidential information of our clients or our vendors we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation and lose clients we also may incur increased operating expenses to recover data repair or remediate systems equipment or facilities and to protect ourselves from such disruptions as we increase our reliance on thirdparty 

table of contents 

systems our exposure to damages from services disruptions may increase and we may incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by these disruptions 

use of open source software could introduce security vulnerabilities impose unanticipated restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services and subject us to increased costs 

we use open source code in our software development and incorporate it into our products and internal systems the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality or security of the code some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary applications with the open source software in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage we have implemented procedures to control the use of source code so as to mitigate this risk however the terms of many open source licenses are also ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts therefore there is a risk that our internal procedures controlling the use of open source code could fail or that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on us if any of this were to occur we could be required to seek alternative thirdparty licenses at increased costs or reduced scope to reengineer products or systems or potentially to discontinue the licensing of certain products any remedial actions could divert resources away from our development efforts be time intensive and have a significant cost 

strategy  market demand risks 

competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products with competitors ranging in size from smaller highly specialized singleproduct businesses to multibilliondollar companies while we believe the breadth and depth of our suite of products and applications offer benefits to our clients that are a competitive advantage our competitors may offer price incentives to attract new business future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenue and asv weak economic conditions may also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries we serve could lower demand for our products clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services such as ours if our clients consolidate their spending with fewer suppliers by selecting suppliers with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data our business could be negatively affected 

the continued shift from active to passive investing could negatively impact user count growth and revenue 

the predominant investment strategy today is still active investing which attempts to outperform the market the main advantage of active management is the expectation that the investment managers will be able to outperform market indices they make informed investment decisions based on their experiences insights knowledge and ability to identify opportunities that can translate into superior performance the main advantage of passive investing is that it closely matches the performance of market indices passive investing requires little decisionmaking by investment managers and low operating costs which result in lower fees for the investor a continued shift to passive investing resulting in an increased outflow to passively managed index funds could reduce demand for the services of active investment managers and consequently the demand of our clients for our services 

a decline in equity andor fixed income returns may impact the buying power of investment management clients 

approximately 83 of our asv is derived from our investment management clients the profitability and management fees of these clients are tied to assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses the value of assets under management but also could cause a significant increase in redemption requests from our clients’ customers further reducing their assets under management reduced client profits and management fees may cause our clients to cut costs moreover extended declines in the equity and fixed income markets may reduce new fund or client creation each of these developments may result in lower demand from investment managers for our services and workstations which could negatively affect our business 

table of contents 

uncertainty in the global economy and consolidation in the financial services industry may cause us to lose clients and users 

many of our clients are investment banks asset managers wealth advisors and other financial services entities uncertainty in the global economy or a lack of confidence in the global financial system could negatively impact our clients which could cause a corresponding negative impact on our business results mergers consolidation or contraction of our clients in the financial services industry also could directly impact the number of clients and prospective clients and users of our products and services if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our products and services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our products and services thus economic uncertainty lack of confidence in the global financial system and consolidation in this sector could adversely affect our business financial results and future growth 

volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth 

the decision on the part of large institutional clients to purchase our services often requires managementlevel sponsorship and typically depends upon the size of the client with larger clients having more complex and timeconsuming purchasing processes the process is also influenced by market volatility these characteristics often lead us to engage in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed as uncertainties in the financial markets may cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments the covid19 pandemic may increase this risk as it may curtail our clients spending and lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions or product service implementations or cause them to cancel or reduce their spending with us which could negatively impact our revenues and future growth 

failure to develop and market new products and enhancements that maintain our technological and competitive position and failure to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace for our products and customer demands 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change including methods and speed of delivery changes in client demands development of new investment instruments and evolving industry standards the direction of these trends can render our existing products less competitive obsolete or unmarketable as a result our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to identify and develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices we may not be successful in developing introducing marketing licensing and implementing new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis or without impacting the stability and efficiency of existing products and customer systems further any new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results our failure or inability to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace including competitor and supplier developments may also adversely affect our business operations and growth 

errors or defects can exist at any point in a products life cycle but are more frequently found after the introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products despite internal testing and testing by clients our products may contain errors we may also experience delays while developing and introducing new products for various reasons such as difficulties in licensing data inputs defects errors or delays in our products that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation loss of revenue lower rate of license renewals or upgrades diversion of development resources product liability claims or regulatory actions or increases in service and support costs 

we have provisions in our client contracts to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by clients based on the use of our products or services or our delay or failure to provide services contracts with customers also increasingly include service level requirements and audit rights to review our security many of our customers in the financial services sector are also subject to regulations and requirements to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships and provide rigorous oversight of relationships that involve certain critical activities some of which may be deemed to be provided by us any failure on our part to comply with the specific provisions in customer contracts could result in the imposition of various penalties which may include termination of contracts service credits suspension of payments contractual penalties adverse monetary judgments and in the case of government contracts suspension from future government contracting even if the outcome of any claims brought against us were ultimately favorable such a claim would require the time and attention of our management personnel as well as financial and other resources and potentially pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations 

table of contents 

failure to identify integrate or realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions and strains on resources as a result of growth 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices additionally there may be integration risks or other risks resulting from acquired businesses our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from past and future acquisitions and alliances depends in part upon our ability to integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses effectively into our core business we cannot guarantee that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels anticipated in addition past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt operations 

growth such as the addition of new clients and acquisitions puts demands on our resources including our internal systems and infrastructure these may require improvements or replacement to meet the additional demands of a larger organization further the addition of new clients and the implementation of such improvements would require additional management time and resources these needs may result in increased costs that could negatively impact results of operations failure to implement needed improvements such as improved scalability could result in a deterioration in the performance of our internal systems and negatively impact the performance of our business 

failure to maintain reputation 

we enjoy a positive reputation in the marketplace our ability to attract and retain clients and employees is affected by external perceptions of our brand and reputation reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity could affect our ability to attract and retain clients and employees and our ability to maintain our pricing for our products although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

operational risks 

failure to enter into renew or comply with contracts supplying new and existing data sets or products on competitive terms 

we collect and aggregate thirdparty content from data suppliers news sources exchanges brokers and contributors into our own dedicated online service which clients access to perform their analyses we combine the data from these sources into our own dedicated databases clients have access to the data and content found within our databases these databases are important to our operations as they provide clients with key information we have entered into thirdparty content agreements of varying lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice some of our content provider agreements are with competitors who may attempt to make renewals difficult or expensive we seek to maintain favorable contractual relationships with our data suppliers including those that are also competitors however we cannot control the actions and policies of our data suppliers and we may have data suppliers who provide us with notice of termination or exclude or restrict us from use of their content or only license such content at prohibitive cost additionally despite our efforts to comply with our thirdparty data supplier agreements there can be no assurances that thirdparties may not challenge our use of their content which could result in increased licensing costs loss of rights and costly legal actions certain data sets that we rely on have a limited number of suppliers although we make every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available we are not dependent on any one thirdparty data supplier in order to meet the needs of our clients with only two data suppliers representing more than 10 of our total data costs for the twelve months ended august 31 2021 our failure to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of our suppliers to deliver accurate data or in a timely manner or the occurrence of a dispute with a vendor over use of their content could increase our costs and reduce the type of content and products available to our clients which could harm our reputation in the marketplace and adversely affect our business 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products 

each year an increasing amount of free or relatively inexpensive information becomes available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products while we believe our service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other valueadded factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources our business results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

inability to hire and retain key qualified personnel 

our business is based on successfully attracting motivating and retaining talented and diverse employees creating a diverse and inclusive environment that promotes empowerment and engagement is key to our ability to attract retain and develop talent competition for talent especially engineering personnel is strong we need technical resources such as engineers to help

develop new products and enhance existing services we rely upon sales personnel to sell our products and services and maintain healthy business relationships our future success also is dependent on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team all of these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace if we are unsuccessful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

operations outside the united states involve additional requirements and burdens that we may not be able to control or manage successfully 

in fiscal 2021 approximately 40 of our revenue related to operations located outside the us in addition a significant number of our employees approximately 78 are located in offices outside the us we expect our growth to continue outside the us with nonus revenues accounting for an increased portion of our total revenue in the future our nonus operations involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our us operations these risks include difficulties in developing products services and technology tailored to the needs of nonus clients including in emerging markets different employment laws and rules rising labor costs in lowerwage countries difficulties in staffing and managing personnel that are located outside the us different regulatory legal and compliance requirements including in the areas of privacy and data protection antibribery and anticorruption trade sanctions and currency controls marketing and sales and other barriers to conducting business social and cultural differences such as language diverse or less stable political operating and economic environments and market fluctuations civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity limited recognition of our brand and intellectual property protection differing accounting principles and standards restrictions on or adverse tax consequences from entity management efforts and changes in us or foreign tax laws if we are not able to adapt efficiently or manage the business effectively in markets outside the us our business prospects and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

the current covid19 pandemic and other global public health epidemics may adversely impact our business our future results of operations and our overall financial performance 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risk or the public perception of risk related to a pandemic or widespread health crisis such as the current covid19 pandemic a significant outbreak epidemic or pandemic of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis adversely affecting the broader economies financial markets and overall demand for our products in addition any preventative or protective actions that governments implement or that we take in respect of a global health crisis such as travel restrictions quarantines or site closures may interfere with the ability of our employees vendors and data suppliers to perform their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business including our ability to gather content such results could have a material adverse effect on our operations business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control for example many jurisdictions have imposed a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of our employees and vendors to limit the spread of covid19 while to date the covid19 pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows due to the ongoing uncertainty related to the duration magnitude and impact of the covid19 pandemic its potential effects on our business remain uncertain the covid19 pandemic may still have a substantial impact on our employees or vendors productivity which could result in our operations including our ability to gather content suffering and in turn our results of operations cash flows and overall financial performance may be impacted furthermore if our employees incur substantial medical expenses due to covid19 our expenses may increase due to our selffunded employee medical insurance model our management is focused on mitigating the effects of covid19 on our business which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of their time and may delay their other efforts the continued impact of covid19 may also increase the severity or likelihood of the other risks described in this item any of which could have a material effect on us 

we continue to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic and continually assess its potential effects on our business in response to the covid19 pandemic we implemented a business continuity plan with a dedicated incident management team to respond quickly and provide ongoing guidance however given the dynamic nature of these circumstances the full impact of the covid19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time the extent to which our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows are affected by covid19 will depend in part on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain as there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the potential effect of the spread of a global pandemic the impact of the covid19 pandemic depends upon various uncertainties including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus the severity of the virus the duration of the outbreak and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the virus this situation is changing continually and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider to be significant risks to our operations if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business and financial

legal  regulatory risks 

legislative and regulatory changes in the environments in which we and our clients operate 

as a business we are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the us and in the other countries in which we operate these laws rules and regulations and their interpretations may change in the future or conflict and compliance with these changes may increase our costs or cause us to make changes in or otherwise limit our business practices in addition the global nature and scope of our business operations make it more difficult to monitor areas that may be subject to regulatory and compliance risk if we fail to comply with any applicable law rule or regulation we could be subject to claims and fines and suffer reputational damage uncertainty caused by political change globally and complex relationships across countries including the us and nations in europe and asia heightens the risk of regulatory uncertainty 

many of our clients operate within a highly regulated environment and must comply with governmental legislation and regulations the us regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry increased regulation of our clients may increase their expenses causing them to seek to limit or reduce their costs from outside services such as ours additionally if our clients are subjected to investigations or legal proceedings they may be adversely impacted possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reduction in assets under management or diminished operations which would adversely affect our revenue recent regulatory changes that we believe might materially impact us and our clients include 

mifid 

in the european union the new version of the markets in financial instruments directive recast also known as mifid ii became effective in january 2018 prior to the effectiveness of the uks withdrawal from the european union on january 1 2021 the uk laws and regulations implementing mifid ii were modified to transpose aspects of eu law and address deficiencies that would have otherwise been created as a result of the withdrawal mifid ii built upon many of the initiatives introduced through mifid and is intended to help improve the functioning of the european union single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards mifid originally became effective in 2007 we believe that compliance with mifid ii requirements is timeconsuming and costly for the investment managers who are subject to it and will cause clients to adapt their pricing models and business practices significantly these increased costs may impact our clients’ spending and may cause some investment managers to lose business or withdraw from the market which may adversely affect demand for our services however mifid ii may also present us with new business opportunities for new service offerings we continue to monitor the impact of mifid ii on the investment process and trade lifecycle we also continue to review the application of key mifid ii requirements and plan to work with our clients to navigate through them 

brexit 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom formally left the european union when the ukeu withdrawal agreement became effective under the withdrawal agreement a transition period began that ran until december 31 2020 on january 1 2021 the uk left the eu single market and customs union as well as all eu policies and international agreements as a result the free movement of persons goods services and capital between the uk and the eu ended and the eu and the uk formed two separate markets on december 24 2020 the eu reached a trade agreement with the uk the trade agreement the trade agreement offers uk and eu companies preferential access to each others markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas however economic relations between the uk and eu will now be on more restricted terms than existed previously the trade agreement does not incorporate the full scope of the services sector and businesses such as banking and finance face uncertainty in march 2021 the uk and eu have agreed on a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation and dialogue on financial services issues between the two countries in a memorandum of understanding the mou which is expected to be signed after formal steps are completed although this has not yet occurred at this time we cannot predict the impact that the trade agreement the mou or any future agreements on services particularly financial services will have on our business and our clients it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results we continue to evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit and partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets this uncertainty may have an impact on our clients’ expansion or spending plans which may in turn negatively impact our revenue or growth

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations 

we are party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation and governmental investigations can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings  of this annual report on form 10k 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights or may infringe upon our intellectual property rights 

we may receive notice from others claiming that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur litigation costs enter into settlements stop selling or redesign affected products or pay damages and satisfy indemnification commitments with our clients or suppliers under contractual provisions of various license arrangements additionally third parties may copy infringe or otherwise profit from the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights requiring us to litigate to protect our rights certain countries may not offer adequate protection of proprietary rights if we are required to defend ourselves or assert our rights or take such actions mentioned our operating margins may decline as a result we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

additional cost due to tax assessments resulting from ongoing and future audits by tax authorities as well as changes in tax laws 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to changes in tax laws as well as tax examinations by various governmental tax authorities the global and diverse nature of our business means that there could be additional examinations by governmental tax authorities and the resolution of ongoing and other probable audits which could impose a future risk to the results of our business in august 2019 and july 2021 we received notices of intent to assess the notices additional salesuse taxes interest and underpayment penalties from the commonwealth of massachusetts department of revenue relating to prior tax periods based upon a review of the notices we believe the commonwealth may assess salesuse tax interest and underpayment penalties on previously recorded sales transactions we filed an appeal to the notices and we intend to contest any such assessment if assessed and continue to cooperate with the commonwealth’s inquiry further on august 10 2021 we received a letter the “letter” from the commonwealth relating to additional prior tax periods requesting sales information to determine if a notice of intent to assess should be issued to factset with respect to these tax periods based upon a preliminary review of the letter we believe the commonwealth might seek to assess salesuse tax interest and underpayment penalties on previously recorded sales transactions due to the uncertainty surrounding the assessment process we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of these matters and as such have not recorded a liability as of august 31 2021 we believe that we ultimately will prevail if we are presented with a formal assessment however if we do not prevail the amount could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

changes in tax laws or the terms of tax treaties in a jurisdiction where we are subject to tax could have an impact on our taxes payable 

financial market risks 

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the failure of hedging arrangements 

due to the global nature of our operations we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee and philippine peso to the extent our international activities increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may increase as well to manage this exposure we utilize derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings with changes in foreign currency although we believe that our foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances our attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful which could cause an adverse impact on both our results of operations and cash flows

fiscal 2021 year in review 

revenue for the fiscal year 2021 was 16 billion an increase of 65 from the prior year revenue increased across our operating segments primarily in the americas followed by emea and asia pacific supported by increased revenue from each of our workflow solutions mainly in analytics  trading followed by cts and wealth revenue also grew due to the benefit from our annual price increase the revenue growth of 65 was primarily attributed to organic revenue growth which excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions completed in the last 12 months changes in foreign currency rates in all periods presented and the deferred revenue fair value adjustments from purchase accounting refer to results of operations nongaap financial measures in this mda for further discussion on organic revenue 

operating income increased 78 and diluted earnings per share eps increased 74 compared with the prior year this increase in operating income and eps was primarily driven by revenue growth of 65 a decrease in noncompensatory employee related expenses an impairment of an investment that occurred in fiscal 2020 and a decrease in professional fees this increase was partially offset by higher spend in employee compensation including stockbased compensation and 

table of contents 

increased computerrelated expenses additionally eps benefited from a reduction in interest expense and diluted weighted average shares outstanding compared with the prior year period 

our clients and users reached new highs of 6453 and 160932 respectively in fiscal 2021 over the last 12 months we returned 3826 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends 

as of august 31 2021 our employee count was 10892 up 39 in the past 12 months due primarily to an increase in net new employees of 66 in asia pacific and 07 in emea partially offset by a decrease of 15 in the americas of our total employees as of august 31 2021 7080 were located in asia pacific 2439 were located in the americas and 1373 were located in emea our centers of excellence located in india the philippines and latvia primarily focus on content collection that benefits all our segments

covid19 update 

a novel strain of coronavirus now known as covid19 covid19 was first reported in december 2019 and it has since extensively impacted the global health and economic environment with the world health organization characterizing covid19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic we implemented a business continuity plan with a dedicated incident management team to respond quickly and provide ongoing guidance so that we could continue offering our clients uninterrupted products services and support while also protecting our employees we believe these actions have been successful and that the pandemic and our responses have not significantly affected the financial results for our 2021 fiscal year 

at the outset of the pandemic we required the vast majority of our employees at our offices across the globe including our corporate headquarters to work remotely and implemented global travel restrictions for our employees since that time we have begun to reopen many of our offices globally utilizing a threephased approach to provide flexibility for employees wishing to work from our offices with a focus on social distancing and safety while acting consistently with applicable local regulations we anticipate that the ability to open offices will vary significantly from region to region based on a number of factors including the availability of covid19 vaccines and the spread of covid19 variants we have worked with local organizations to procure vaccines for our employees and encouraged them to get vaccinated our offices will not reopen fully until local authorities permit us to do so and our own criteria and conditions to ensure employee health and safety are satisfied 

as of august 31 2021 there have been minimal interruptions in our ability to provide our products services and support to our clients working remotely has had relatively little impact on the productivity of our employees including our ability to gather content we continue to work closely with our clients to provide consistent access to our products and services and have remained flexible to achieve client priorities 

based on our success in working in a remote environment during the covid19 pandemic we expect to implement a new work standard under which employees in many of our locations where permitted by local laws and regulations and where the role permits will have the opportunity to choose between different work arrangements these include working either in a hybrid arrangement where an employee can split time between working from the office and working from a preapproved remote location or a fully remote arrangement where an employee can work entirely from a preapproved remote location 

table of contents 

our revenue earnings and asv are relatively stable and predictable as a result of our subscriptionbased business model to date the covid19 pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our revenue earnings or asv we incurred additional expenses at the start of the covid19 pandemic particularly relating to equipment to enable our employees to support our clients while working remotely which were not material to our fiscal 2021 results as we have continued to work in remote and hybrid environments reductions in discretionary spending particularly travel and entertainment have more than offset any related increased expenses given our transition to our new work standard we anticipate that many of these expense reductions will continue going forward as we incur less travel and entertainment spending than we did prepandemic and seek to reduce our spending on office space that is no longer necessary in our new work environment 

refer to item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the potential impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

annual subscription value asv 

as of august 31 2021 organic annual subscription value organic asv plus professional services totaled 17 billion an increase of 72 over august 31 2020 organic asv increased across all our geographic segments with the majority of the increase related to the americas followed by emea and asia pacific 

we believe asv reflects our ability to grow recurring revenue and generate positive cash flow and is the key indicator of the successful execution of our business strategy 

– asv at any point in time represents our forwardlooking revenue for the next 12 months from all subscription services currently being supplied to client excluding revenues from professional services 

– organic asv at any point in time equals our asv excluding asv from acquisitions and dispositions completed within the last 12 months and the effects of foreign currency movements on the current year period 

– professional services are revenues derived from projectbased consulting and implementation 

– organic asv plus professional services at any point in time equals the sum of organic asv and professional services 

organic asv plus professional service 

the following table presents the calculation the calculation of organic asv plus professional services as of august 31 2021 with proper notice provided as contractually required our clients can add to delete portions of or terminate service subject to certain limitations

as of august 31 2021 organic asv plus professional services was 17 billion an increase of 72 compared with august 31 2020 the increase in yearoveryear organic asv was largely attributed to existing clients followed by new client sales and existing client price increases partially offset by existing client cancellations 

organic asv increased across all our geographic segments with the majority of the increase related to the americas followed by emea and asia pacific this increase was driven by additional sales in our workflow solutions primarily in research followed by analytics  trading and cts sales increased in research mainly due to higher demand for our workstations sales increased in analytics  trading mainly from our portfolio analytics portfolio reporting performance and reporting front office and risk and quantitative solutions cts sales increased primarily due to core and premium content sets specifically related to company financial data and data management solutions

income taxes 

the fiscal 2021 provision for income taxes was 680 million compared with 542 million in fiscal 2020 an increase of 255 the increase was primarily due to net changes in jurisdictional pretax book income in fiscal 2021 compared with the prior year additionally the increase was driven by a 44 million lower windfall tax benefit from stockbased compensation for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 changes in tax rates in certain jurisdictions and a lower benefit from finalizing prior year tax returns of 12 million the increase was partially offset by the impact of the trueup of certain foreign deferred tax balances and higher research and development tax credits

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we use nongaap financial measures including organic revenue adjusted operating margin adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share the reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are show in the tables below these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to financial measures reported in accordance with gaap moreover these nongaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect

all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate similarly titled nongaap financial measures differently that we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes 

despite the limitations of these nongaap financial measures we believe these adjusted financial measures and the information they provide are useful in viewing our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals adjusted measures may also facilitate comparisons to our historical performance

operating 

for fiscal 2021 net cash provided by operating activities was 5552 million compared with 5058 million for fiscal 2020 an increase of 494 million this increase was primarily driven by higher net income and the timing of tax payments in certain jurisdictions partially offset by certain working capital changes inclusive of increases in variable compensation accruals 

investing 

for fiscal 2021 net cash used in investing activities was 1360 million representing a 624 million increase from the prior year this increase was mainly due to the acquisition of businesses primarily related to the acquisition of tvl for approximately 419 million in cash net of cash acquired and a 163 million decrease in capital expenditures

foreign currency 

foreign currency exposure 

certain whollyowned subsidiaries primarily within the emea and asia pacific segments where approximately 78 of our employees are located are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of the foreign subsidiaries net assets or liabilities from their respective functional currencies into us dollars using an end of period exchange rate the net translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity 

during fiscal 2021 foreign currency movements decreased operating income by 54 million compared with a 50 million increase to operating income in the prior year to mitigate the foreign currency exposure we entered into a series of forward contracts to hedge a portion of our british pound sterling euro indian rupee and philippine peso exposures ranging from 25 to 75 over their respective hedged periods as of august 31 2021 the current foreign currency forward contracts are set to mature at various points between the first quarter of fiscal 2022 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires us to make certain estimates and apply judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared and as such they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the critical accounting estimates and judgments that we believe to have the most significant impacts to our consolidated financial statements are described below 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to 

table of contents 

any business the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations research and development rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and the foreign derived intangible income fdii deduction our annual effective tax rate was 145 127 and 164 in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

to account for unrecognized tax benefits we first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority the determination of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits including associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits however we have no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes andor penalties that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position beyond current estimates for this reason and due to ongoing audits by multiple tax authorities we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made we do not currently anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units on the date of acquisition our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any one of our reporting units below its respective carrying amount 

we may elect to perform a qualitative analysis for the reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value in performing a qualitative assessment we consider such factors as macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions in which we operate including the competitive environment and significant changes in demand for our services we also consider the share price both in absolute terms and in relation to peer companies if the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its 

table of contents 

carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative analysis a quantitative analysis is performed to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists 

the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount using an income approach along with other relevant market information derived from a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our reporting units an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value if any would be recognized the loss recognized would not exceed total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we determined after performing a qualitative review of each reporting unit that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeds their respective carrying amounts accordingly there was no indication of impairment and a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not performed 

our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases client relationships software technology and trade names resulting from acquisitions which have been fully integrated into our operations as well as internaluse software we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization the weighted average useful life of our identifiable intangible assets at august 31 2021 was 91 years if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life there were no material adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented these intangible assets had no assigned residual values as of august 31 2021 and 2020 

intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted no indicators of impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented our ongoing consideration of recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31 2021 and 2020 was 1350 million and 1211 million respectively refer to note 9 goodwill and note 10 intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details 

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements and lease rightofuse rou assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability we use our best estimate of future cash flows undiscounted and excluding interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such assets carrying value exceeds its fair value based on the most appropriate valuation technique including discounted cash flows 

in determining indicators for impairment we take various factors into account including but not limited to a significant decline in our expected future cash flows changes in expected useful life unanticipated competition slower growth rates ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets or changes in the usage or operating performance a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred and in calculating the inputs to the impairment calculation such as estimates related to future cash flows and asset fair values forecasting asset useful lives and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions included in our impairment assessment we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

there have been no longlived asset impairment charges and no change to our impairment assessment methodology for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets was 1314 million as of august 31 2021 and 1331 million as of august 31 2020 refer to note 8 property equipment and leasehold improvements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

contingencies 

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and litigation that have arisen in the ordinary course of business which involve inherent uncertainties including but not limited to employment matters and commercial and intellectual property litigation assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities 

table of contents 

requires judgment if actual results differ from our assessments our financial position results of operations or cash flows would be affected 

business combinations 

we account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the underlying identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill and assigned to one or more reporting units the amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisitionrelated tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the expected useful life requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items acquisitionrelated expenses and restructuring costs if any are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee and philippine peso changes in the exchange rates for such currencies into us dollars can affect our revenues earnings and the carrying values of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet either positively or negatively 

to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings 

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2021 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 153 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base if we had no hedges in place as of august 31 2021 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2021 with operating results held constant in local currencies would result in a decrease in operating income of 382 million over the next 12 months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2021 would have increased the fair value of total assets by 714 million and equity by 467 million 

refer to note 6 derivative instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on our foreign currency exposures and our foreign currency forward contracts

the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents and investments at august 31 2021 was 7178 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value we are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments as we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low refer to note 3 summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on our cash and cash equivalents

debt 

as of august 31 2021 we had long term debt outstanding under the 2019 revolving credit facility with a principal balance of 5750 million the debt bears interest on the outstanding principle at a rate equal to libor plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid the variable rate of interest on our longterm debt can expose us to interest rate volatility due to changes in libor to mitigate this exposure on march 5 2020 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 2875 million to hedge the variable interest rate obligation effectively converting the floating interest rate to fixed for the hedged portion thus we are only exposed to base interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings in excess of any amounts that are not hedged or 2875 million of our outstanding principal balance assuming all terms of our outstanding longterm debt remained the same a hypothetical 25 basis point change up or down in the onemonth libor would result in a 07 million change to our annual interest expense for the portion of the longterm debt not hedged by the interest rate swap agreement refer to note 13 debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations

technology  data security risks 

loss corruption and misappropriation of data and information relating to clients and others 

many of our products as well as our internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of our own as well as supplier and customer proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data this includes data from client portfolios and strategies breaches of this confidentiality should they occur could result in the loss of clients and termination of arrangements with suppliers for the use of their data if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal data controls unauthorized access or misappropriation of client or supplier data by an employee or an external thirdparty could occur additionally the maintenance and enhancement of our systems may not be completely effective in preventing loss unauthorized access or misappropriation data misappropriation unauthorized access or data loss could instill a lack of confidence in our products and systems and damage our brand reputation and business breaches of security measures could expose us our clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for us as well as the loss of existing or potential clients many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy and protection of personal information including the european union general data protection regulation which became effective 

table of contents 

may 25 2018 and californias consumer privacy act which became effective january 1 2020 both require companies to satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including our use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves the law in this area continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws could impact our processing of personal and sensitive information related to our content operations employees clients and suppliers and may expose us to claims of violations 

successful cyberattacks and the failure of cybersecurity systems and procedures 

in providing our digitalenabled services to clients we rely on information technology infrastructure that is managed internally along with placing reliance on thirdparty service providers we and these thirdparty service providers are subject to the risks of system failures and security breaches including cyberattacks such as phishing scams viruses and denials of service attacks as well as employee errors or malfeasance our and our vendors use of mobile and cloud technologies may increase our risk for such threats our protective systems and procedures and those of third parties to which we are connected such as cloud computing providers may not be effective against these threats our information technology systems must be constantly updated and patched to protect against known vulnerabilities and to optimize performance our contracts with service providers typically require them to implement and maintain adequate security controls but we may not have the ability to effectively monitor these security measures as a result inadequacies of the third party security technologies and practices may not be detected until after a security breach has occurred we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of clients’ or suppliers’ data other external data internal data or information technology systems if the services provided to clients were disrupted or if products or services were perceived as having security vulnerabilities the costs we would incur to address and resolve these security incidents would increase our expenses these types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits regulatory investigations and claims loss of business and increased legal liability we also make acquisitions periodically while significant effort is placed on addressing information technology security issues with respect to the acquired companies we may inherit such risks when these acquisitions are integrated into our infrastructure 

a prolonged or recurring outage at our data centers and other business continuity disruptions at facilities could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

our clients rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data and applications our business is dependent on our ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on our computerbased networks and systems if we experience significant growth of our customer base or increases in the number of products or services or in the speed at which we are required to provide products and services it may strain our systems additionally our systems and networks may become strained due to aging or endoflife technology that we have not yet updated or replaced our computer operations as well as our other business centers and those of our suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war civil unrest internet failures computer viruses security breaches and other events beyond our reasonable control we maintain backup facilities and certain other redundancies for each of our major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt those operations however a loss of our services involving our significant facilities may materially disrupt our business and may induce our clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business although we seek to minimize these risks through security measures controls backup data centers and emergency planning there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective additionally we may also face significant increases in our use of power and data storage and may experience a shortage of capacity and increased costs associated with such usage 

transition to new technologies applications and processes could expose us to unanticipated disruptions 

the technology landscape is constantly evolving to remain competitive we must adapt and migrate to new technologies applications and processes use of more advanced technologies and infrastructure is critical to the development of our products and services the scaling of our business for future growth and the accurate maintenance of our data and operations the implementation of new technologies and infrastructure such as migration to new cloudbased systems is complex and can involve substantial expenditures as well as risks inherent in the conversion to any new system including potential loss of information and disruption to operations we may experience unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products and services certain of our technologies are also dependent upon third party providers to maintain adequate systems to protect the security of our confidential information and data failure by our providers to maintain appropriate security could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a network disruption that could further lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data regulatory penalties and remedial costs any disruption to either the provider’s systems or the communication links between us and the provider could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems and could impair our ability to provide services to our clients if the services to our clients are disrupted or if there is unauthorized access to the confidential information of our clients or our vendors we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation and lose clients as we increase our reliance on third party systems our exposure to damages from services disruptions may increase and we may incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by these disruptions 

table of contents 

use of open source software could introduce security vulnerabilities impose unanticipated restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services and subject us to increased costs 

we use open source code in our software development and incorporate it into our products and internal systems the use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality or security of the code some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary applications with the open source software in a certain manner we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage we have implemented procedures to control the use of source code so was to mitigate this risk however the terms of many open source licenses are also ambiguous and have not been interpreted by us or other courts therefore there is a risk that our internal procedures controlling the use of open source code could fail or that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on us if any of this were to occur we could be required to seek alternative thirdparty licenses at increased costs or reduced scope to reengineer products or systems or potentially to discontinue the licensing of certain products any remedial actions could divert resources away from our development efforts be time intensive and have a significant cost 

strategy  market demand risks 

competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products with competitors ranging in size from smaller highly specialized singleproduct businesses to multibilliondollar companies while we believe the breadth and depth of our suite of products and applications offer benefits to our clients that are a competitive advantage our competitors may offer price incentives to attract new business future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenue weak economic conditions may also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries we serve could lower demand for our products clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services such as ours if our clients consolidate their spending with fewer suppliers by selecting suppliers with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data our business could be negatively affected 

the continued shift from active to passive investing could negatively impact user count growth and revenue 

the predominant investment strategy today is still active investing which attempts to outperform the market the main advantage of active management is the expectation that the investment managers will be able to outperform market indices they make informed investment decisions based on their experiences insights knowledge and ability to identify opportunities that can translate into superior performance the main advantage of passive investing is that it closely matches the performance of market indices passive investing requires little decisionmaking by investment managers and low operating costs which result in lower fees for the investor a continued shift to passive investing resulting in an increased outflow to passively managed index funds could reduce demand for the services of active investment managers and consequently the demand of our clients for our services 

a decline in equity andor fixed income returns may impact the buying power of investment management clients 

approximately 84 of our asv is derived from our investment management clients the profitability and management fees of these clients are tied to assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses the value of assets under management but also could cause a significant increase in redemption requests from our clients’ customers further reducing their assets under management reduced client profits and management fees may cause our clients to cut costs moreover extended declines in the equity and fixed income markets may reduce new fund or client creation each of these developments may result in lower demand from investment managers for our services and workstations which could negatively affect our business 

uncertainty in the global economy and consolidation in the financial services industry may cause us to lose clients and users 

many of our clients are investment banks asset managers wealth advisors and other financial services entities uncertainty in the global economy or a lack of confidence in the global financial system could negatively impact our clients which could cause a corresponding negative impact on our business results mergers consolidation or contraction of our clients in the financial services industry also could directly impact the number of clients and prospective clients and users of our products and services if our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients or that use fewer of our products and services they may discontinue or reduce their use of our products and services thus economic uncertainty lack of confidence 

table of contents 

in the global financial system and consolidation in this sector could adversely affect our business financial results and future growth 

volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth 

the decision on the part of large institutional clients to purchase our services often requires managementlevel sponsorship and typically depends upon the size of the client with larger clients having more complex and timeconsuming purchasing processes the process is also influenced by market volatility these characteristics often lead us to engage in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed as uncertainties in the financial markets may cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments the covid19 pandemic may increase this risk as it may curtail our clients spending and lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions or product service implementations or cause them to cancel or reduce their spending with us which could negatively impact our revenues and future growth 

failure to develop and market new products and enhancements that maintain our technological and competitive position and failure to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace for our products and customer demands 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change including methods and speed of delivery changes in client demands development of new investment instruments and evolving industry standards the direction of these trends can render our existing products less competitive obsolete or unmarketable as a result our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to identify and develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices we may not be successful in developing introducing marketing licensing and implementing new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis or without impacting the stability and efficiency of existing products and customer systems further any new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products and services that satisfy our clients needs and generate revenues required to provide the desired results our failure or inability to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace including competitor and supplier developments may also adversely affect our business operations and growth 

errors or defects can exist at any point in a products life cycle but are more frequently found after the introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products despite internal testing and testing by clients our products may contain errors we may also experience delays while developing and introducing new products for various reasons such as difficulties in licensing data inputs defects errors or delays in our products that are significant or are perceived to be significant could result in rejection or delay in market acceptance damage to our reputation loss of revenue lower rate of license renewals or upgrades diversion of development resources product liability claims or regulatory actions or increases in service and support costs 

we have provisions in our client contracts to limit our exposure to potential liability claims brought by clients based on the use of our products or services or our delay or failure to provide services contracts with customers also increasingly include service level requirements and audits rights to review our security many of our customers in the financial services sector are also subject to regulations and requirements to adopt risk management processes commensurate with the level of risk and complexity of their thirdparty relationships and provide rigorous oversight of relationships that involve certain critical activities some of which may be deemed to be provided by us any failure on our part to comply with the specific provisions in customer contracts could result in the imposition of various penalties which may include termination of contracts service credits suspension of payments contractual penalties adverse monetary judgments and in the case of government contracts suspension from future government contracting even if the outcome of any claims brought against us were ultimately favorable such a claim would require the time and attention of our management personnel as well as financial and other resources and potentially pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations 

failure to identify integrate or realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions and strains on resources as a result of growth 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices additionally there may be integration risks or other risks resulting from acquired businesses our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from past and future acquisitions and alliances depends in part upon our ability to integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses effectively into our core business we cannot guarantee that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels anticipated in addition past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt operations 

growth such as the addition of new clients and acquisitions puts demands on our resources including our internal systems and infrastructure these may require improvements or replacement to meet the additional demands of a larger organization further the addition of new clients and the implementation of such improvements would require additional management time 

table of contents 

and resources these needs may result in increased costs that could negatively impact results of operations failure to implement needed improvements such as improved scalability could result in a deterioration in the performance of our internal systems and negatively impact the performance of our business 

failure to maintain reputation 

we enjoy a positive reputation in the marketplace our ability to attract and retain clients and employees is affected by external perceptions of our brand and reputation reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity could affect our ability to attract and retain clients and employees and our ability to maintain our pricing for our products although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

operational risks 

failure to enter into renew or comply with contracts supplying new and existing data sets or products on competitive terms 

we collect and aggregate thirdparty content from thousands of data suppliers news sources exchanges brokers and contributors into our own dedicated online service which clients access to perform their analyses we combine the data from these sources into our own dedicated databases clients have access to the data and content found within our databases these databases are important to our operations as they provide clients with key information we have entered into thirdparty content agreements of varying lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice some of our content provider agreements are with competitors who may attempt to make renewals difficult or expensive we seek to maintain favorable contractual relationships with our data suppliers including those that are also competitors however we cannot control the actions and policies of our data suppliers and we may have data suppliers who provide us with notice of termination or exclude or restrict us from use of their content or only license such content at prohibitive cost additionally despite our efforts to comply with our thirdparty data supplier agreements there can be no assurances that third parties may not challenge our use of their content which could result in increased licensing costs loss of rights and costly legal actions certain data sets that we rely on have a limited number of suppliers although we make every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available we are not dependent on any one thirdparty data supplier in order to meet the needs of our clients no single vendor or data supplier represented more than 10 of our total data costs during fiscal 2020 except for one vendor which is a supplier of risk models and portfolio optimizer data to factset and represented 11 of our data costs in fiscal 2020 our failure to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of our suppliers to deliver accurate data or in a timely manner or the occurrence of a dispute with a vendor over use of their content could increase our costs and reduce the type of content and products available to our clients which could harm our reputation in the marketplace and adversely affect our business 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products 

each year an increasing amount of free or relatively inexpensive information becomes available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products while we believe our service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other valueadded factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

inability to hire and retain key qualified personnel 

our business is based on successfully attracting motivating and retaining talented and diverse employees creating a diverse and inclusive environment that promotes empowerment and engagement is key to our ability to attract retain and develop talent competition for talent especially engineering personnel is strong we need technical resources such as engineers to help develop new products and enhance existing services we rely upon sales personnel to sell our products and services and maintain healthy business relationships our future success also is dependent on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team all of these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace if we are unsuccessful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected and could have a material adverse effect on our business 

operations outside the united states involve additional requirements and burdens that we may not be able to control or manage successfully 

in fiscal 2020 approximately 41 of our revenue related to operations located outside the us in addition a significant number of our employees approximately 76 are located in offices outside the us we expect our growth to continue outside the us with nonus revenues accounting for an increased portion of our total revenue in the future our nonus operations involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our us operations these risks include difficulties in 

table of contents 

developing products services and technology tailored to the needs of nonus clients including in emerging markets different employment laws and rules rising labor costs in lowerwage countries difficulties in staffing and managing personnel that are located outside the us different regulatory legal and compliance requirements including in the areas of privacy and data protection antibribery and anticorruption trade sanctions and currency controls marketing and sales and other barriers to conducting business social and cultural differences such as language diverse or less stable political operating and economic environments and market fluctuations civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity limited recognition of our brand and intellectual property protection differing accounting principles and standards restrictions on or adverse tax consequences from entity management efforts and changes in us or foreign tax laws if we are not able to adapt efficiently or manage the business effectively in markets outside the us our business prospects and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

the current covid19 pandemic and other global public health epidemics may adversely impact our business our future results of operations and our overall financial performance 

our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risk or the public perception of risk related to a pandemic or widespread health crisis such as the current covid19 pandemic a significant outbreak epidemic or pandemic of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis adversely affecting the broader economies financial markets and overall demand for our products in addition any preventative or protective actions that governments implement or that we take in respect of a global health crisis such as covid19 such as travel restrictions quarantines or site closures may interfere with the ability of our employees vendors and data suppliers to perform their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business including our ability to gather content such results could have a material adverse effect on our operations business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the covid19 pandemic that are not within our control for example many jurisdictions have imposed a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of our employees and vendors to limit the spread of covid19 if the covid19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees or vendors attendance or productivity our operations including our ability to gather content may suffer and in turn our results of operations and overall financial performance may be impacted furthermore if our employees incur substantial medical expenses due to covid19 our expenses may increase due to our selffunded employee medical insurance model our management is focused on mitigating the effects of covid19 on our business which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of their time and may delay their other efforts the impact of covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic may also increase the severity or likelihood of the other risks described in this item any of which could have a material effect on us 

we closely monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic and continually assess its potential effects on our business given the dynamic nature of these circumstances the full impact of the covid19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time the extent to which our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows are affected by covid19 will depend in part on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain as there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the potential effect of the spread of a global pandemic the impact of the covid19 pandemic depends upon various uncertainties including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus the severity of the virus the duration of the outbreak and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the virus this situation is changing continually and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider to be significant risks to our operations if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively our business and financial condition could be negatively impacted refer to management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  covid19 update for additional information 

legal  regulatory risks 

legislative and regulatory changes in the environments in which we and our clients operate 

as a business we are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the us and in the other countries in which we operate these laws rules and regulations and their interpretations may change in the future or conflict and compliance with these changes may increase our costs or cause us to make changes in or otherwise limit our business practices in addition the global nature and scope of our business operations make it more difficult to monitor areas that may be subject to regulatory and compliance risk if we fail to comply with any applicable law rule or regulation we could be subject to claims and fines and suffer reputational damage uncertainty caused by political change globally and complex relationships across countries including the us and nations in europe and asia heightens the risk of regulatory uncertainty 

many of our clients operate within a highly regulated environment and must comply with governmental legislation and regulations the us regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry increased regulation of our clients may increase their expenses causing them to seek to limit or reduce their costs from outside services 

table of contents 

such as ours additionally if our clients are subjected to investigations or legal proceedings they may be adversely impacted possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reduction in assets under management or diminished operations which would adversely affect our revenue recent regulatory changes that we believe might materially impact us and our clients include 

mifid 

in the european union the new version of the markets in financial instruments directive recast also known as mifid ii became effective in january 2018 mifid ii built upon many of the initiatives introduced through mifid and is intended to help improve the functioning of the european union single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards mifid originally became effective in 2007 we believe that compliance with mifid ii requirements is timeconsuming and costly for the investment managers who are subject to it and will cause clients to adapt their pricing models and business practices significantly these increased costs may impact our clients’ spending and may cause some investment managers to lose business or withdraw from the market which may adversely affect demand for our services however mifid ii may also present us with new business opportunities for new service offerings we continue to monitor the impact of mifid ii on the investment process and trade lifecycle we also continue to review the application of key mifid ii requirements and plan to work with our clients to navigate through them 

brexit 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom formally left the european union when the ukeu withdrawal agreement became effective under the withdrawal agreement a transition period began and will run until december 31 2020 but could be extended the uk and the eu are currently in the process of negotiating a ukeu free trade deal and the terms of their future relationship but have so far not been able to finalize their future arrangement the deadline for these negotiations is the expiry of the transition period and the uk government has made it clear that it will not ask to extend the transition period at this time we cannot predict the impact that the future ukeu arrangements will have on our business and our clients as it will depend on the longerterm outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations although the results of these negotiations are currently unknown it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results while we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit we continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets this uncertainty may have an impact on our clients’ expansion or spending plans which may in turn negatively impact our revenue or growth 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations 

we are party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation and governmental investigations can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings  of this annual report on form 10k 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights or may infringe upon our intellectual property rights 

we may receive notice from others claiming that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms incur litigation costs enter into settlements stop selling or redesign affected products or pay damages and satisfy indemnification commitments with our clients or suppliers under contractual provisions of various license arrangements additionally third parties may copy infringe or otherwise profit from the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights requiring us to litigate to protect our rights certain countries may not offer adequate protection of proprietary rights if we are required to defend ourselves or assert our rights or take such actions mentioned our operating margins may decline as a result we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk 

additional cost due to tax assessments resulting from ongoing and future audits by tax authorities as well as changes in tax laws 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to changes in tax laws as well as tax examinations by various governmental tax authorities the global and diverse nature of our business means that there could be additional examinations by governmental tax authorities and the resolution of ongoing and other probable audits which could impose a future risk to the results of our business in august 2019 we received a notice of intent to assess the notice additional sales taxes interest and underpayment penalties from the commonwealth of massachusetts department of revenue relating to prior tax periods the notice follows factset’s previously disclosed response to a letter from the commonwealth requesting additional sales 

table of contents 

information based upon a preliminary review of the notice we believe the commonwealth may assess sales tax interest and underpayment penalties on previously recorded sales transactions we intend to contest any such assessment if assessed and continue to cooperate with the commonwealth’s inquiry due to uncertainty surrounding the assessment process we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of this matter and as such have not recorded a liability as of august 31 2020 we believe that we ultimately will prevail if we are presented with a formal assessment however if we do not prevail the amount could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position cash flows and results of operations 

changes in tax laws or the terms of tax treaties in a jurisdiction where we are subject to tax could increase our taxes payable on december 22 2017 the us tax cuts and jobs act tcja was signed into law the tcja enacted broad changes to the us internal revenue code including reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 among many other complex provisions the ultimate impact of such tax reform may differ from our current estimate due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of further regulations or guidance or further legislative changes to the us internal revenue code 

financial market risks 

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the failure of hedging arrangements 

due to the global nature of our operations we conduct business o utside the us in se veral currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee and philippine peso  to the extent our international activities increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may increase as well to manage this exposure we utilize derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings with changes in foreign currency although we believe that our foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances our attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful which could cause an adverse impact on our results of operations 

business performance may not be sufficient to meet financial guidance or publicly disclosed longterm targets 

we provide public fullyear financial guidance based upon assumptions regarding our expected financial performance including our ability to grow revenue and organic asv plus professional services to meet our planned expenses and maintain a certain tax rate and our ability to achieve our profitability targets we can provide no assurances that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past or that our growth strategies will be successful if we are unable to successfully execute on our strategies to achieve our growth objectives and retain our existing clients or if we experience higher than expected operating costs or taxes we risk not meeting our fullyear financial guidance or may find it necessary to revise such guidance during the year

fiscal 2020 year in review 

revenue for the fiscal year 2020 was 149 billion an increase of 41 from the prior year this increase was due to growth across all our operating segments primarily in the americas followed by emea and asia pacific supported by increased revenue from each of our workflow solutions mainly in analytics and trading followed by cts and wealth revenue also increased due to the benefit from our annual price increase the revenue growth of 41 was fully attributed to organic revenue growth which excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions completed in the last 12 months changes in foreign currency rates in all periods presented and the deferred revenue fair value adjustments from purchase accounting refer to results of operations nongaap financial measures in this mda for further discussion on organic revenue as of august 31 2020 organic annual subscription value organic asv plus professional services totaled 156 billion an increase of 53 over the prior year 

operating income increased by 04 and diluted earnings per share eps increased 63 compared to the prior year this increase in operating income and eps was primarily driven by revenue growth of 41 a decrease in noncompensatory employee related expenses and a reduction in bad debt expense this increase was partially offset by higher spend in employee compensation including stockbased compensation increased computerrelated expenses the impairment of an investment and increased professional fees on a yearoveryear basis additionally eps benefited from a reduction in the income tax provision interest expense and diluted weighted average shares outstanding compared to the prior year period 

our clients and users reached new highs of 5875 and 133051 respectively in fiscal 2020 over the last 12 months we returned 3101 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends

covid19 update 

a novel strain of coronavirus now known as covid19 covid19 was first reported in december 2019 and it has since extensively impacted the global health and economic environment with the world health organization characterizing covid19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 the covid19 virus has spread to nearly all regions in the world creating significant uncertainties and disruption in the global economy 

table of contents 

we closely monitor pandemicrelated developments and our highest priority is the health and safety of our employees clients vendors and stakeholders we have taken and continue to take numerous steps to address the covid19 pandemic we have implemented a business continuity plan with a dedicated incident management team to respond quickly and effectively to changes in our environment to continue offering our clients uninterrupted products services and support while also protecting our employees we will continue to coordinate our covid19 response based on guidance from global health organizations relevant governments and pandemic response best practices 

we have required the vast majority of our employees at our offices across the globe including our corporate headquarters to work remotely on a temporary basis and have implemented global travel restrictions for our employees nearly all our employees are currently working remotely we believe our transition to remote working has been successful and has not significantly affected our financial results for the fiscal year ended august 31 2020 

we are planning to reopen many of our offices during fiscal 2021 utilizing a threephased approach to provide flexibility for employees with a focus on social distancing and safety our offices will not reopen until local authorities permit us to do so and our own criteria and conditions to ensure employee health and safety are satisfied there can be no assurances as to when we reopen our offices or that there will be no negative impacts arising from the return to the office environment 

as of august 31 2020 there have been minimal interruptions in our ability to provide our products services and support to our clients working remotely has had relatively little impact on the productivity of our employees including our ability to gather content we continue to work closely with our clients to provide consistent access to our products and services and have remained flexible to achieve client priorities as many implement their own contingency plans we have increased our support desk resources to manage increased volumes and have extended additional web ids to our clients in need of immediate remote access to financial data 

we have not observed any significant client loss deterioration in the collectability of receivables reduction in liquidity or decline in subscription renewal rates as a result of the covid19 pandemic our revenue earnings and asv are relatively stable and predictable as a result of our subscriptionbased business model to date we have not seen the covid19 pandemic having a material impact on our revenue or asv although we anticipate that there may be some level of revenue and asv weakness going forward due to longer sales cycles and lower incremental client billings the covid19 pandemic could curtail our clients’ spending and lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions or product and service implementations or may cause them to cancel or reduce their spending with us in determining the possible revenue and asv impact from the covid19 pandemic we consider the potential delay in decision making causing longer sales cycles or conversely delayed cancellations from clients implementation risk due to restrictions on being able to work onsite at our clients facilities and possible reduced seasonal hiring at investment banks which are some of our largest clients over the summer months 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional expenses in response to the covid19 pandemic including costs to enable our employees to support our clients while working remotely these additional expenses were not material to our fiscal 2020 results and reductions in discretionary spending particularly travel and entertainment have more than offset these increased expenses we believe that implementing additional cost reduction efforts will help us mitigate the impact that any reduced revenues may have on our future operating income we may consider reducing expenses further through such methods as reduction of discretionary spending including travel and entertainment tighter management of headcount spending and reduction in variable thirdparty content costs in a manner consistent with client demand 

on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act was signed into law to address the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic we continue to monitor any effects that may result from the cares act and other similar legislation or actions in geographies in which our business operates

income taxes net income and diluted earnings per share 



income taxes 

the fiscal 2020 provision for income taxes was 542 million compared to 692 million in fiscal 2019 a decrease of 217 the decrease was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2020 compared to the prior year period driven mainly by higher research and development rd tax credits and a higher foreign derived intangible income fdii deduction the decrease was also driven by a reduction from finalizing prior year tax returns which resulted in a benefit of 37 million in fiscal 2020 compared to an increase to the provision of 77 million in fiscal 2019  additionally the decrease in the provision was attributed to 19 million in higher windfall tax benefits from stockbased compensation for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 partially offset by a 34 million income tax benefit from the revision of the onetime transition tax permitted by the tcja recognized during fiscal 2019

nongaap financial measures 

to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we use nongaap financial measures including organic revenue adjusted operating margin adjusted net 

table of contents 

income and adjusted diluted earnings per share the reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are show in the tables below these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from as a substitute for or superior to financial measures reported in accordance with gaap moreover these nongaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate similarly titled nongaap financial measures differently that we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes 

despite the limitations of these nongaap financial measures we believe these adjusted financial measures and the information they provide are useful in viewing our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals adjusted measures may also facilitate comparisons to our historical performance

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity have been our cash flows generated from our operations existing cash and cash equivalents and when needed our credit capacity under our existing credit facility we have primarily used these sources of liquidity to among other things service our existing and future debt obligations fund our working capital requirements for operations and capital expenditures investments acquisitions dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock based on past performance and current expectations we believe our liquidity along with other financing alternatives will provide us the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future

longterm debt 

2019 credit agreement 

on march 29 2019 we entered into a credit agreement with pnc bank national association pnc the 2019 credit agreement which provides for a 7500 million revolving credit facility the 2019 revolving credit facility we may request borrowings under the 2019 revolving credit facility until its maturity date of march 29 2024 the 2019 credit agreement also allows us subject to certain requirements to arrange for additional borrowings with pnc for an aggregate amount up to 5000 million provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of 250 million 

as of august 31 2020 we have borrowed 5750 million of the available 7500 million provided by the 2019 revolving credit facility resulting in 1750 million available to be withdrawn we are required to pay a commitment fee using a pricing grid which was 010 as of august 31 2020 this fee is based on the daily amount by which the available balance in the 2019 revolving credit facility exceeds the borrowed amount all outstanding loan amounts are reported as longterm debt within the consolidated balance sheets at august 31 2020 and august 31 2019 the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date 

the fair value of our longterm debt was 5750 million as of august 31 2020 which we believe approximates the carrying amount as the terms and interest rate approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis borrowings under the loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to libor plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid which was 0875 as of august 31 2020 the variable rate of interest on our longterm debt can expose us to interest rate volatility due to changes in libor to mitigate this exposure on march 5 2020 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 2875 million to hedge the variable interest rate obligation on a portion of our outstanding balance under the 2019 revolving credit facility under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement we will pay interest at a fixed rate of 07995 and receive variable interest payments based on the same onemonth libor utilized to calculate the interest expense from the 2019 revolving credit facility the interest rate swap agreement matures on march 29 2024 

during fiscal 2019 we incurred approximately 09 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2019 credit agreement these costs were capitalized as loan origination fees and are amortized into interest expense ratably over the term of the 2019 credit agreement 

during fiscal 2020 we recorded interest expense on our outstanding debt including the amortization of debt issuance costs net of the effects of the interest rate swap agreement of 129 million during fiscal 2019 we recorded interest expense on our outstanding debt including the amortization of debt issuance costs of 198 million including the effects of the interest rate swap agreement the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was 220 for the twelve months ended august 31 2020 the weighted average interest rate for fiscal 2019 was 335 interest on the loan outstanding is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date 

the 2019 credit agreement contains covenants and requirements restricting certain activities which are usual and customary for this type of loan in addition the 2019 credit agreement requires that we maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio as measured by total net funded debtebitda as defined in the 2019 credit agreement below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter we were in compliance with all the covenants and requirements within the 2019 credit agreement as of august 31 2020 

the borrowings under the 2019 credit agreement were used to retire all outstanding debt under the previous 2017 credit agreement between factset as the borrower and pnc as the lender on march 29 2019 the total principal amount of the debt outstanding at the time of retirement was 5750 million and there were no prepayment penalties

operating 

for fiscal 2020 net cash provided by operating was 5058 million compared to 4271 million in fiscal 2019 an increase of 787 million this increase was primarily driven by higher net income and timing of other operating cash flows partially offset by the timing of income tax payments 

investing 

for fiscal 2020 net cash used in investing activities was 736 million compared to 561 million in fiscal 2019 an increase in cash used from investing activities of 175 million this increase was mainly due to higher capital expenditures of 183 million driven primarily by increased development costs related to internaluse software 

financing

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property equipment leasehold improvements and intangible assets we present free cash flow solely as a supplemental disclosure to provide useful information to investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



1 capital expenditures are included in net cash used in investing activities during each fiscal period reported 

for fiscal 2020 we generated free cash flow of 4282 million compared to 3678 million in fiscal 2019  an increase of 604 million this increase reflects an increase of 787 million in cash provided by operating activities partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures of 183 million 

contractual obligations 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here with the exception of the new leases entered in the ordinary course of business and purchase commitments associated with our technology investment plan and business transformation activities there were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations during fiscal 2020

increased operating income by 50 million compared to a 101 million increase to operating income in the same period a year earlier 

as of august 31 2020 we maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our british pound sterling euro indian rupee and philippine peso exposures we entered into a series of forward contracts to mitigate our currency exposure ranging from 25 to 75 over their respective hedged periods the current foreign currency forward contracts are set to mature at various points between the first quarter of fiscal 2021 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

as of august 31 2020  the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase philippine pesos and indian rupees with us dollars was ₱13 billion and rs14 billion respectively the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase us dollars with euros and british pound sterling was €318 million and £364 million respectively 

a loss on derivatives of 20 million was recorded in operating income during fiscal 2020  compared to a loss of 18 million in fiscal 2019 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which requires us to make certain estimates and apply judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared and as such they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the critical accounting policies estimates and judgments that we believe to have the most significant impacts to our consolidated financial statements are described below 

revenue recognition 

the majority of our revenue is derived from client access to our hosted proprietary data and analytics platform which can include various combinations of products and services available over the contractual term the hosted platform is a subscriptionbased service that consists primarily of providing access to products and services including workstations analytics enterprise data research management and trade execution we have determined that the subscriptionbased service represents a single performance obligation covering a series of distinct products and services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the client based on the nature of the services and products offered by us we apply an input timebased measure of progress as the client is simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits of the platform we record revenue for our contracts using the overtime revenue recognition model as a client is invoiced or performance is satisfied a provision for billing adjustments and cancellation of services is estimated and accounted for as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable refer to note 4 revenue recognition in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and the fdii deduction our annual effective tax rate was 127 164 and 241 in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the 

table of contents 

adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

to account for unrecognized tax benefits we first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority the determination of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits including associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits however we have no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes andor penalties that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position beyond current estimates for this reason and due to ongoing audits by multiple tax authorities we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made we do not currently anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months 

we classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as taxes payable noncurrent and to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year the benefit will be classified as taxes payable current additionally we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws this interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements as of august 31 2020  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 123 million including 09 million of accrued interest recorded as taxes payable noncurrent within the consolidated balance sheets refer to note 10 income taxes in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for furthe r information 

business combinations 

we account for business combinations using the purchase method of accounting the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the underlying identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill and assigned to one or more reporting units the amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisitionrelated tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the expected useful life requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items acquisitionrelated expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units on the date of acquisition our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life we review our goodwill for impairment annually dur ing the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any one of our reporting units below its respective carrying amount 

in performing the goodwill impairment test we first perform a qualitative assessment which requires that we consider factors such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions in which factset operates including the competitive environment and significant changes in demand for our services we also consider our share price both in absolute terms and in relation to our peers if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are greater than the carrying amounts then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not performed 

if the qualitative assessment indicates that the quantitative analysis should be performed we then evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value including the associated goodwill to determine the fair values we use an income approach along with other relevant market information derived from a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value of our reporting units an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value if any would be recognized the loss recognized would not exceed total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

table of contents 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we determined after performing a qualitative review of each reporting unit that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeds their respective carrying amounts accordingly there was no indication of impairment and the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not performed 

our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases client relationships software technology internaluse software noncompete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions which have been fully integrated into our operations we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization the weighted average useful life of our identifiable intangible assets at august 31 2020 was 119 years if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life there were no material adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented these intangible assets had no assigned residual values as of august 31 2020 and 2019 

intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted no indicators of impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31 2020 and 2019 was 1211 million and 1244 million respectively refer to note 8 goodwill and note 9 intangible assets in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further details 

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and excluding interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described here there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets was 1331 million as of august 31 2020 and 1194 million as of august 31 2019 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the p ast three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material refer to note 7 property equipment and leasehold improvements in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information 

performancebased equity awards 

performancebased equity awards whether in the form of performancebased stock options or performance share units require management to make assumptions rega rding the likelihood of achieving performance targets the number of performancebased awards that vest will be predicated on achieving performance levels during the measurement period subsequent to the date of grant dependent on the financial performance levels attained a percentage of the performancebased awards will vest to the grantees however there is no current guarantee that such awards will vest in whole or in part refer to note 16 stockbased compensation in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee and philippine peso changes in the exchange rates for such currencies into us dollars can affect our revenues earnings and the carrying values of our assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet either positively or negatively 

to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations the we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of aocl and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings 

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2020 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 130 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base if we had no hedges in place as of august 31 2020 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2020 with operating results held constant in local currencies would result in a decrease in operating income by 354 million over the next 12 months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2020 would have increased the fair value of total assets by 663 million and equity by 416 million 

volatility in the british pound sterling exchange rate remains a possibility in the short term as the uk continues the transition resulting from its exit from the european union in the longer term any impact from brexit will depend on in part the outcome of tariff regulatory and other negotiations refer to item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion on brexit

cash and cash equivalents and investments 

the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents and investments at august 31 2020 was 6052 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value we are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations of interest rates on our investments as we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low refer to note 3 summary of significant accounting policie s in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for more information on our cash and cash equivalents and investments policies 

debt 

as of august 31 2020 we had long term debt outstanding under the 2019 revolving credit facility with a principal balance of  5750 million the debt bears interest on the outstanding principle at a rate equal to libor plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid the variable rate of interest on our longterm debt can expose us to interest rate volatility due to changes in libor to mitigate this exposure on march 5 2020 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  2875 million to hedge the variable interest rate obligation effectively converting the floating interest rate to fixed for the hedged portion thus we are only exposed to base interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings in excess of any amounts that are not hedged or  2875 million of our outstanding principal balance assuming all terms of our outstanding longterm debt remained the same a hypothetical 25 basis point change up or down in the onemonth libor would result in a 07

the following chart provides a snapshot of factset’s historic asv growth

 

 

financial information on geographic areas

 

operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that have the following characteristics i it engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses ii its operating results are regularly reviewed by the company’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and iii its discrete financial information is available executive management along with the ceo constitute our chief operating decision making group “codmg” executive management consists of certain executives who directly report to the ceo consisting of the chief financial officer chief technology and product officer global head of sales and client solutions general counsel chief human resources officer and head of analytics and trading the codmg reviews financial information at the operating segment level and is responsible for making decisions about resources allocated amongst the operating segments based on actual results

 

 

our operating segments are aligned with how the company including its codmg manages the business and the demographic markets in which it serves our internal financial reporting structure is based on three segments the us europe and asia pacific we believe this alignment helps to better manage the business and serve client needs as each segment requires financial and economic information specific to their respective markets our primary functional groups within the us europe and asia pacific segments include sales consulting data collection product development and software engineering which provide global financial and economic information to investment managers investment banks and other financial services professionals

 

the us segment serves investment professionals including financial institutions throughout the americas the europe and asia pacific segments serve investment professionals located throughout europe and asia pacific respectively financial information including revenues operating income and longlived assets related to our operations in each geographic area are presented in note 8 segment information  and in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8

 

the us segment has offices in 15 locations within 13 states throughout the us including our corporate headquarters in norwalk connecticut as well as two additional offices located in brazil and canada the european segment maintains office locations in bulgaria uae dubai england france germany italy latvia luxembourg the netherlands south africa spain and switzerland the asia pacific segment has office locations in australia hong kong china india japan the philippines and singapore segment revenue reflects direct sales to clients based in their respective geographic locations each segment records compensation expense including stockbased compensation amortization of intangible assets depreciation of furniture and fixtures amortization of leasehold improvements communication costs professional fees rent expense travel office and other direct expenses

 

expenditures associated with our data centers thirdparty data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the us segment and are not allocated to the other segments the content collection centers located in india the philippines and latvia benefit all our operating segments and thus the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenue

 

the following charts depict revenue related to our reportable segments

talent

 

we have built a collaborative culture that recognizes and rewards innovation and offers employees a variety of opportunities and experiences our employees are critical to our success and are the reason we continue to execute at a high level we believe our continued focus on making employee engagement a top priority will help us provide high quality insights and information to clients globally

 

as of august 31 2019 our employee headcount was 9681 an increase of 11 in the last twelve months of our total employees 2351 are in the us 1282 in europe and 6048 in the asia pacific segment in order to optimize productivity we have invested in expanding our footprint and talent pool in india and the philippines where we now have a combined workforce of approximately 5800 people as of august 31 2019 approximately 430 factset employees within certain french and german subsidiaries were represented by mandatory works councils an amount consistent with fiscal 2018 no other employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements

 

 

in december 2018 we appointed daniel viens as chief human resources officer in may 2019 we announced that john w wiseman the company’s global head of sales and client solutions would step down from his position on june 1 2019 remaining at the company until august 31 2019 to assist during the transition in the same announcement effective june 1 2019 we appointed franck ar gossieaux as the companys new global head of sales and client solutions

 

thirdparty content

 

we aggregate content from over 1000 thirdparty data suppliers news sources exchanges brokers and contributors into our own dedicated single online service which the client accesses to perform their analysis we license content from premier providers of major global exchanges and data providers we seek to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each major type of financial data though certain data sets on which we rely have a limited number of suppliers we make every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available we are not dependent on any one thirdparty data supplier in order to meet the needs of our clients we have entered into thirdparty content agreements of varying lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice no single vendor or data supplier represented more than 10 of factsets total data costs during fiscal 2019 with the exception for one vendor which is a supplier of risk models and portfolio optimizer data to factset and represented 11 of factset’s data costs in fiscal 2019

 

data centers

 

our business is dependent on our ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on our networks and systems our global technology infrastructure supports our operations and is designed to facilitate the reliable and efficient processing and delivery of data and analytics to our clients our data centers contain multiple layers of redundancy to enhance system performance including maintaining processing and storing data at multiple data centers user connections are load balanced between data centers in the event of a site failure equipment problem or localized disaster the remaining centers have the capacity to handle the additional load we continue to be focused on maintaining a global technological infrastructure that allows us to support our growing business

 

we are embarking on a set of programs that will increasingly move our systems and applications to cloud computing platforms we continue to operate fully redundant data centers in both virginia and new jersey in the us that can handle our entire client capacity in addition select workloads are migrating to diverse cloud computing regions utilizing premier marketleading cloud providers

 

the competitive landscape

 

we are a part of the financial information services industry providing accurate financial information and workflow solutions to the global investment community this extremely competitive market is comprised of both large wellcapitalized companies and smaller niche firms including market data suppliers news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply us with financial information included in the factset workstation our largest competitors are bloomberg lp refinitiv formerly part of thomson reuters and sp global market intelligence other competitors and competitive products include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications such as msci inc morningstar inc blackrock solutions and rimes technologies corporation many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those we sell our development of robust sets of proprietary content combined with our news and quotes offering have resulted in more direct competition with the largest financial data providers

 

despite competing products and services we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer through our indepth analytics and client service we believe we can offer clients a more comprehensive solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities through a desktop or mobile user interface or through a standardized or bespoke data feed in addition our applications including our client support and service offerings are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysisscreening capabilities offered we are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients own proprietary data including portfolio holdings as a result our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decisionmaking

 

 

intellectual property

 

we have registered trademarks and copyrights for many of our products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees clients data suppliers and vendors we seek to protect our workflow solutions documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws while we do not believe we are dependent on any one of our intellectual property rights we do rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect our proprietary rights despite these efforts existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection

 

research and product development costs

 

a key aspect of our growth strategy is to enhance our existing products and applications by making them faster with more reliable data we strive to rapidly adopt new technology that can improve our products and services at factset we do not have a separate research and product development department but rather our product development and engineering departments work closely with our strategists product managers sales and other clientfacing specialists to identify areas of improvement to provide increased value to our clients research and product development costs relate to the salary and benefits for our product development software engineering and technical support staff these costs are expensed as incurred within our cost of services as employee compensation we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products and enhancements that will allow us to respond quickly to market changes and efficiently meet the needs of our clients we incurred research and product development costs of 2147 million 2171 million and 2150 million during fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

income taxes 

 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

 

the fiscal 2019 provision for income taxes was 692 million a decrease of 184 from the same period a year ago the decrease was primarily attributable to the enactment of the tcja the tcja imposed a onetime transition tax expense which resulted in a 232 million impact to the income tax provision for fiscal 2018 without a comparable impact in fiscal 2019 this transition tax impact was revised during fiscal 2019 resulting in a net benefit of 34 million upon finalizing the accounting for the tax effects of the tcja the tcja also lowered the statutory us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 which was fully applicable for fiscal 2019 compared to the lower tax rate being phased in for the prior year comparable period the reduction in the us corporate income tax rate required a remeasurement of our net us deferred tax position which resulted in a nonrecurring tax charge of 22 million during fiscal 2018 the decrease in the income tax provision year over year was partially offset by a 33 million income tax expense from finalizing prior years’ tax returns and other discrete items for fiscal 2019

 

our effective tax rate was 164 for the full fiscal 2019 year compared to 241 a year ago was mainly due the reduction in the federal statutory rate from the enactment of the tcja that was fully applicable for fiscal year 2019 compared to being phased in for the prior year comparable period the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was also due to the onetime transition tax from the tcja that was recorded in the prior year period these benefits were partially offset by higher foreign income taxed at rates lower than us rates

 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

 

the fiscal 2018 provision for income taxes was 848 million a decrease of 15 from fiscal 2017 the decrease was primarily attributable to the impacts associated with the us tax reform under the tcja on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation through the tcja the tcja among other things lowered the statutory us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 due to our august 31 fiscal yearend the lower tax rate was phased in resulting in a blended us statutory federal rate of 257 for fiscal 2018 the tcja also implemented a modified territorial tax system and imposed a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings and profits “ep” of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from us income taxes

 

our effective tax rate was 241 for the full fiscal 2018 year compared to 250 in fiscal 2017 due to higher foreign income taxed at rates lower than us rates incremental income tax benefits from rd tax credits and increased excess tax benefits from stock option exercises these benefits were partially offset by the onetime transition tax of 232 million and a 23 million tax expense associated with the remeasurement of our net us deferred tax position both of which related to the tcja we had approximately 250 million in undistributed foreign ep generated prior to december 31 2017 which resulted in the provisional amount for the onetime transition tax expense of 232 million payable over an eightyear period

 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

 

net income increased 321 to 3528 million while diluted earnings per share increased 339 to 908 during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 net income and diluted eps increased primarily due to higher operating income a reduction in the income tax provision primarily due to the tcja reform partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with our outstanding debt diluted eps also benefited from a 05 million share reduction in our diluted weighted average shares outstanding compared to the same period a year ago mainly due to share repurchases partially offset by the impact from stock options issued

 

 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

 

net income increased 34 to 2671 million while diluted earnings per share increased 41 to 678 during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 net income and diluted eps grew primarily from higher revenue from strong performances across our segments and workflow solutions gains earned from our foreign currency hedges and a decrease in our effective tax rate due to the tcja these benefits were partially offset by an increase in employee compensation expenses data costs amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions occupancy costs and interest expense associated with our outstanding debt diluted eps also benefited from a 03 million reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to share repurchases partially offset by stock option exercises during fiscal 2018

 

nongaap financial measures 

 

to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we use nongaap financial measures including organic revenue adjusted operating margin adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share the reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are shown in tables below these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for or superior to financial measures reported in accordance with gaap moreover these nongaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate similarly titled nongaap financial measures differently than we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes

 

despite the limitations of these nongaap financial measures we believe these adjusted financial measures and the information they provide are useful in viewing our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals adjusted measures may also facilitate comparisons to our historical performance

net cash used in investing activities was 561 million in fiscal 2019 representing a 76 million increase in cash used from investing activities compared to fiscal 2018 this increase was primarily due to 259 million of higher capital expenditures offset by a 150 million decrease in acquisition activity and a 33 million increase in net proceeds from investments net of purchases

 

during fiscal 2019 net cash used in financing activities was 2143 million representing a 1058 million decrease from fiscal 2018 this decrease was due primarily to 5750 million of borrowings under our 2019 credit agreement an 836 million decrease in share repurchases and a 354 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans this decrease was partially offset by the 5750 million retirement of the 2017 credit agreement and a 106 million increase in dividend payments refer to the capital resources section of the mda for a discussion on our longterm debt borrowings

 

we expect that for at least the next 12 months our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash as of august 31 2019 our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was 3598 million with 1326 million included in the us segment the majority of which is held in bank accounts located within the us 1835 million in the europe segment predominantly within bank accounts in the uk france and germany and the remaining 437 million held in the asia pacific segment as of august 31 2019 we also had 5742 million in outstanding borrowings net of 08 million of unamortized debt issuance costs we believe our liquidity including cash on hand cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our shortterm and longterm operating requirements including working capital needs capital expenditures dividend payments stock repurchases growth objectives and other financing activities in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future

 

 

free cash flow generated in fiscal 2019 was 3678 million an increase of 44 compared to 3521 million in fiscal 2018 free cash flow is the result of 4271 million of net cash provided by operating activities partially offset by 594 million in capital expenditures the year over year increase to free cash flow was primarily driven by higher net income and an increase in client collections due to a reduction in our days sales outstanding dso to 37 days as of august 31 2019 compared to 41 days for the prior year period partially offset by higher capital requirements from the buildout of new office space and the timing of supplier and tax payments

 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

 

cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 2086 million or 147 of our total assets at august 31 2018 compared with 1947 million or 138 of our total assets at august 31 2017 our cash and cash equivalents increased 139 million during fiscal 2018 due to net cash provided by operating activities of 3857 million and 716 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options these cash inflows were partially offset by 894 million in dividend payments 335 million of capital expenditures 150 million related to a business investment 32 million from the effects of foreign currency translations and 3039 million in share repurchases which included 3024 million under the existing share repurchase program and 15 million in shares repurchased from employees to cover their cost of taxes upon vesting of restricted stock

 

net cash used in investing activities was 485 million in fiscal 2018 representing a 2988 million decrease from fiscal 2017 this reduction was primarily due to decreased acquisition activity with 150 million invested in fiscal 2018 compared to 3031 million largely related to the bisam technologies “bisam” and vermilion holdings limited “vermilion” acquisitions in fiscal 2017 additionally cash used in investing activities decreased year over year due to lower capital expenditures of 33 million and a decrease in the purchase of investments net of proceeds of 74 million year over year

 

during fiscal 2018 net cash used in financing activities was 3200 million representing a 3119 million increase from fiscal 2017 this increase was due to 2750 million in proceeds net of repayment from the issuance of longterm debt in fiscal 2017 that did not occur in fiscal 2018 in addition the decrease was due to higher dividend payments of 85 million an increase in share repurchases of 430 million and a change in the presentation of tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements due to the adoption of the accounting standard update which required us to disclose benefits from stock option exercises as an operating cash inflow instead of a financing activity this presentation change was adopted prospectively beginning with fiscal 2018 these cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from employee stock plans of 216 million

 

free cash flow generated in fiscal 2018 was 3521 million an increase of 241 compared to 2837 million in fiscal 2017 free cash flow was attributable to 2671 million of net income 870 million of noncash items 316 million of working capital changes less 335 million in capital expenditures the year over year free cash flow growth was driven by positive working capital changes totaling 476 million and lower capital expenditures of 33 million working capital improved year over year due to timing of supplier payments and payroll stabilization of our days sales outstanding “dso” at 41 days and the adoption of an accounting standard update for sharebased payments which required the presentation of benefits from stock options exercised to be reported as an operating activity when in prior periods it was reported as a financing activity

longterm debt 

 

2019 credit agreement 

 

on march 29 2019 the company entered into the 2019 credit agreement the 2019 credit agreement between factset as the borrower and pnc bank national association pnc as the administrative agent and lender the 2019 credit agreement provides for a 7500 million revolving credit facility the 2019 revolving credit facility factset may request borrowings under the 2019 revolving credit facility until its maturity date of march 29 2024 the 2019 credit agreement also allows factset subject to certain requirements to arrange for additional borrowings with pnc for an aggregate amount of up to 5000 million provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of 250 million

 

factset borrowed 5750 million of the available 7500 million provided by the 2019 revolving credit facility resulting in 1750 million available to be withdrawn factset is required to pay a commitment fee using a pricing grid currently at 010 based on the daily amount by which the available balance in the 2019 revolving credit facility exceeds the borrowed amount all outstanding loan amounts are reported as longterm debt within the consolidated balance sheets at august 31 2019 the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date

 

the fair value of our longterm debt was 5750 million as of august 31 2019 which the company believe approximates carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis borrowings under the loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid currently at 0875 during fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 factset recorded interest expense of 198 million 159 million and 84 million respectively on its outstanding debt amounts the weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was 335 and 269 as of august 31 2019 and 2018 respectively interest on the loan outstanding is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date

 

during fiscal 2019 factset incurred approximately 09 million in debt issuance costs related to the 2019 credit agreement these costs were capitalized as loan origination fees and are amortized into interest expense ratably over the term of the 2019 credit agreement

 

the 2019 credit agreement contains covenants and requirements restricting certain factset activities which are usual and customary for this type of loan in addition the 2019 credit agreement requires that factset maintain a consolidated net leverage ratio as measured by total net funded debtebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter the company was in compliance with all the covenants and requirements within the 2019 credit agreement as of august 31 2019

 

the borrowings from the 2019 credit agreement were used to retire all outstanding debt under the previous 2017 credit agreement between factset as the borrower and pnc as the lender on march 29 2019 the total principal amount of the debt outstanding at the time of retirement was 5750 million and there were no prepayment penalties

foreign currency

 

foreign currency exposure

 

certain whollyowned subsidiaries within the europe and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a component of stockholders’ equity

 

our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where 76 of our employees were located as of august 31 2019 during fiscal 2019 foreign currency movements increased operating income by 101 million compared to a decrease in operating income by 13 million for fiscal 2018

 

foreign currency hedges

 

as of august 31 2019 we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposures

 

  

  

  

  

as of august 31 2019 the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase philippine pesos and indian rupees with us dollars was ₱14 billion and rs14 billion respectively the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase us dollars with euros and british pound sterling was €357 million and £205 million respectively

 

there were no other outstanding foreign currency contracts as of august 31 2019 a loss on derivatives of 18 million was recorded in operating income during fiscal 2019 compared to a gain of 31 million in fiscal 2018

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements

 

at august 31 2019 and 2018 we had no offbalance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating offbalance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes

 

share repurchase program

 

repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions in fiscal 2019 we repurchased 09 million shares for 2131 million compared to 15 million shares for 3024 million in fiscal 2018 under the existing share repurchase program over the last 12 months we have returned 3204 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends

 

on june 24 2019 the board of directors of factset approved a 2100 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program subsequent to this expansion 2386 million is available for future repurchases as of august 31 2019

 

contractual obligations

 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors disclosed below as of august 31 2019 and 2018 we had total purchase commitments with suppliers of 833 million and 790 million respectively there were no material changes in the company’s purchase commitments with suppliers during fiscal 2019

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2019 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

 

  

  

  

  

  

 

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are received as well as due to changes to agreedupon amounts for any of our obligations

 

on february 14 2018 we entered into a new lease to relocate our corporate headquarters to 45 glover avenue in norwalk connecticut the new location will comprise approximately 173000 square feet of office space we took possession of the newly leased property on january 1 2019 for fitout purposes we will continue to occupy our existing headquarters space until the new headquarters property is ready for occupancy currently estimated to be in the second quarter of fiscal 2020

 

including new lease agreements executed during fiscal 2019 our worldwide leased office space increased to approximately 1860000 square feet at august 31 2019 up 110000 square feet or 63 from august 31 2018 this increase was primarily related to additional office space in india future minimum requirements for our operating leases in place as of august 31 2019 totaled 4000 million a decrease from 4078 million as of august 31 2018 this decrease is primarily due the passage of a year on remaining rental agreement terms reducing the overall future minimum lease obligation partially offset by added office space in india

 

as disclosed earlier in the capital resources section of this mda we entered into the 2019 credit agreement on march 29 2019 and borrowed 5750 million in conjunction with the 2019 credit agreement factset retired its loan outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement amount of 5750 million

 

with the exception of the new leases entered in the ordinary course of business there were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations during fiscal 2019

 

dividends

 

on august 9 2019 our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of 072 to be paid on september 19 2019 the 008 per share or 125 increase marked our 14 th consecutive year we have increased dividends highlighting our continued commitment to returning value to shareholders over the last 12 months we have returned 3204 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends future cash dividends will depend on our earnings capital requirements financial condition and other relevant factors dividends must be authorized by our board of directors

 

during fiscal years 2019 and 2018 our board of directors declared the following dividends on our common stock

 

  

 

significant accounting policies

 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below

 

critical accounting estimates

 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements

 

business combinations

 

the company accounts for its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting the acquisition purchase price is allocated to the underlying identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the acquisition date the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of the identified assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill and assigned to one or more reporting units the amounts and useful lives assigned to acquisitionrelated tangible and intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization expense determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the expected useful life requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items acquisitionrelated expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred

 

performancebased equity awards

 

performancebased equity awards whether in the form of stock options or restricted stock require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving performance targets the number of performancebased awards that vest will be predicated on achieving performance levels during the measurement period subsequent to the date of grant dependent on the financial performance levels attained a percentage of the performancebased awards will vest to the grantees however there is no current guarantee that such awards will vest in whole or in part

 

june 2017 performancebased option grant review

 

in connection with the acquisition of bisam factset granted 206417 performancebased stock options in june 2017 these performancebased options were scheduled to vest 40 on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20 on each subsequent anniversary date if certain bisam revenue and operating income targets were achieved by march 31 2019 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 it was determined that the performance criteria were not achieved by march 31 2019 and as such the options were forfeited and no stockbased compensation expense was recorded for this performancebased option grant for fiscal 2019

 

accrued compensation

 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation we conduct a final review of company departmental and individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate as of august 31 2019 and 2018 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was 494 million and 436 million respectively

 

 

goodwill and intangible assets

 

goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life at least annually we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment and if impaired write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the us europe and asia pacific which is aligned with how the chief operating decision making group “codmg” composed of the ceo and executive management manages the business and the demographic markets we serve the three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries or business units within each operating segment the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units including assigning assets liabilities goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit

 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations in fiscal 2019 we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for the reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value in performing a qualitative assessment factset considers such factors as macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions in which factset operates including the competitive environment and significant changes in demand for the company’s services the company also considers its share price both in absolute terms and in relation to peer companies if the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if factset elects not to perform a qualitative analysis a quantitative analysis is performed to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists

 

future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset

 

we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 consistent with the timing of previous years it was determined that there was no impairment as it was not more likely than not the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value using the qualitative screen the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2019 and 2018 was 6857 million and 7018 million respectively

 

our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases client relationships software technology noncompete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions which have been fully integrated into our operations we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization the weighted average useful life of our identifiable intangible assets at august 31 2019 was 126 years if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life there were no material adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented these intangible assets had no assigned residual values as of august 31 2019 and 2018

 

intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted no indicators of impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31 2019 and 2018 was 1206 million and 1489 million respectively

 

 

longlived assets

 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and excluding interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described here there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets was 1325 million as of august 31 2019 and 1005 million as of august 31 2018

 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material

 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies

 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and the foreign derived intangible income deduction our annual effective tax rate was 164 241 and 250 in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition

 

to account for unrecognized tax benefits we first determine whether it is morelikelythannot defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date a tax position that meets this morelikelythannot threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority the determination of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits including associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits however we have no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes andor penalties that would have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position beyond current estimates for this reason and due to ongoing audits by multiple tax authorities we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the company does not currently anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months

 

 

we classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as taxes payable noncurrent and to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year the benefit will be classified as taxes payable current additionally we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws this interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements as of august 31 2019 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 109 million including 11 million of accrued interest recorded as taxes payable noncurrent within the consolidated balance sheets

 

new accounting pronouncements

 

see note 3 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption which we include here by reference

 

market trends

 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations

 

shift from active to passive investment management

 

approximately 837 of our asv is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but also could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover a shift from active investment management to passive investment management can result in lower demand for our services our investment banking clients that provide ma advisory work capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 163 of our asv a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulgebracket banks credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations our clients could also encounter similar issues a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in ma funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth our revenue may decline if banks including those involved in merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma capital markets and equity research to compensate for the challenges faced by other departments

 

brexit

 

on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union brexit on march 29 2017 the united kingdom invoked article 50 of the lisbon treaty formally starting negotiations with the european union united kingdom and european union leaders then backed an extension until october 31 2019 to provide more time to complete negotiations on formal withdrawal and transitional arrangements on october 17 2019 a new brexit deal was agreed between the european union and the uk government on october 22 2019 the uk parliament approved the new brexit deal but rejected the timing of its implementation following the vote in the uk parliament european council president donald tusk confirmed that he would recommend that the european union leaders agree to a third extension to the article 50 period until january 31 2020 to give the united kingdom more time to scrutinize the new brexit deal and to avoid a nodeal brexit the political and economic instability created by the brexit vote has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets at this time we cannot predict the impact that brexit will have on our business as it will depend in part on the longerterm outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results while we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets

 

 

markets in financial instruments directive “mifid”

 

mifid ii built upon many of the initiatives introduced through mifid and is intended to help improve the functioning of the european union single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards mifid originally became effective in 2007 and was enhanced through adoption of mifid ii which became effective in january 2018 we continue to monitor the impact in the european union of mifid ii on the investment process and trade lifecycle as well as any impact of mifid ii on noneuropean union countries we also continue to review the application of key mifid ii requirements in the event of a nodeal brexit in light of a recent publication by the european securities and markets authority we plan to work with our clients to navigate the mifid ii requirements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations

 

foreign currency exchange risk

 

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the euro british pound sterling indian rupee and philippine peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency

 

 

foreign currency hedges

 

as of august 31 2019 we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposures

 

  

  

  

  

as of august 31 2019 the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase philippine pesos and indian rupees with us dollars was ₱14 billion and rs14 billion respectively the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase us dollars with euros and british pound sterling was €357 million and £205 million respectively

 

a loss on derivatives of 18 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2019 compared to a gain of 31 million in fiscal 2018 the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings the related cash flow impacts of all our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities

 

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2019 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 108 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheets such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base if we had no hedges in place as of august 31 2019 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2019 would result in a decrease in operating income by 280 million over the next 12 months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2019 would increase the fair value of total assets by 669 million and equity by 601 million

 

volatility in the british pound sterling exchange rate is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the european union in the longer term any impact from brexit will depend on in part on the outcome of tariff regulatory and other negotiations

 

 

interest rate risk

 

cash and cash equivalents and investments

 

the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents and investments at august 31 2019 was 3856 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value our investments consist of both mutual funds and certificates of deposit as both are part of our investment strategy these mutual funds and certificates of deposit are included as investments current assets on our consolidated balance sheets as the mutual funds can be liquidated at our discretion and the certificates of deposit have original maturities greater than three months but less than one year the mutual funds and certificates of deposit are held for investment purposes and are not considered debt securities it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin as we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events

 

debt

 

as of august 31 2019 the fair value of our longterm debt was 5750 million which approximated its carrying amount the application of a floating interest rate equal to the daily libor rate plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid approximates the current market rate for similar instruments it is anticipated that the fair market value of our debt will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates we do not believe that the value of our debt has been significantly impacted by current market events the debt bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid currently at 0875 during fiscal years 2019 2018 and 2017 we recorded interest expense of 198 million 159 million and 84 million respectively on our outstanding debt amounts assuming all terms of our outstanding longterm debt remained the same a hypothetical 25 basis point change up or down in the onemonth libor rate would result in a 14 million change to our annual interest expense

financial information on geographic areas

 

operating segments are defined as i components of an enterprise that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses ii with operating results that are regularly reviewed by the enterprise’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and iii for which discrete financial information is available executive management along with the ceo constitute our chief operating decision making group “codmg” executive management consists of certain executives who directly report to the ceo including the chief financial officer chief technology and product officer global head of sales and client solutions general counsel chief human resources officer and head of analytics  trading the codmg reviews financial information at the operating segment level and is responsible for making decisions about resources allocated amongst the operating segments based on actual results

 

our operating segments are aligned with how the company including its codmg manages the business and the demographic markets we serve our internal financial reporting structure is based on three segments the us europe and asia pacific we believe this alignment helps us better manage the business and focus on markets that demand our products our primary functional groups within the us europe and asia pacific segments include sales consulting data collection product development and software engineering which provide global financial and economic information to investment managers investment banks and other financial services professionals

 

the us segment services investment professionals including financial institutions throughout the americas the european and asia pacific segments service investment professionals located throughout europe and the asia pacific segment respectively financial information including revenues operating income and longlived assets related to our operations in each geographic area are presented in note 7 segment information  and in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8

expenditures associated with our data centers data costs and corporate charges are recorded by the us segment and are not allocated to the other segments the centers of excellence which focus primarily on content collection and are located in india and the philippines benefit all operating segments and thus the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues

 

the following charts depict revenues related to our reportable segments

 

 

talent

 

since our founding we have built a collaborative culture that recognizes and rewards innovation and offers employees a variety of opportunities and experiences our employees are critical to our success and the reason we continue to execute at a high level we believe our continued focus on making employee engagement a top priority will help us provide high quality insights and information to clients globally

 

in order to optimize productivity we have invested in expanding our footprint and talent pool in india and the philippines where we now have a combined workforce of over 5500 people

 

as of august 31 2018 our employee headcount was 9571 an increase of 55 in the last twelve months of our total employees 2471 are in the us 1246 in europe and 5854 in the asia pacific segment

 

in fiscal 2018 approximately 430 factset employees within certain french and german subsidiaries were represented by mandatory works councils an amount consistent with fiscal 2017 no other employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements

 

in may 2018 we announced that maurizio nicolelli the company’s chief financial officer would depart factset as of december 31 2018 in july 2018 we announced that helen l shan would join factset as the new chief financial officer beginning in september 2018 additionally in july 2018 we announced that edward bakergreene the company’s chief human resources officer would depart factset as of november 30 2018

 

thirdparty content

 

we aggregate content from thousands of thirdparty data suppliers news sources exchanges brokers and contributors into our own dedicated online service which clients access to perform their analyses we carry content from premier providers of major global exchanges and data providers we seek to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each major type of financial data though certain data sets on which we rely have a limited number of suppliers we make every effort when reasonable to locate alternative sources to ensure that we are not dependent on any one third party data supplier we have entered into thirdparty content agreements at varying lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice no single vendor or data supplier represented 10 or more of our total data expenses in any fiscal year presented

 

 

 

data centers

 

our business is dependent on our ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on our networks and systems our global technology infrastructure supports our operations and is designed to facilitate the reliable and efficient processing and delivery of data and analytics to our clients our data centers contain multiple layers of redundancy to enhance system performance including maintaining processing and storing data at multiple data centers user connections are load balanced between data centers in the event of a site failure equipment problem or localized disaster the remaining centers have the capacity to handle the additional load we continue to be focused on maintaining a global technological infrastructure that allows us to support our growing business

 

several years ago we launched project nextgen to evolve away from large mainframe computers to a more distributed environment powered by a vast array of smaller faster and more costeffective machines we operate fully redundant data centers in both virginia and new jersey in the us that can handle our entire client capacity in addition we maintain a vast private wide area network that provides a highspeed direct link between the client’s local network and the data content and powerful applications found on our mainframe machines

 

the competitive landscape

 

we are a part of the financial information services industry providing accurate financial information and software solutions to the global investment community this extremely competitive market is comprised of both large wellcapitalized companies and smaller niche firms including market data suppliers news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply us with financial information included in the factset workstation our largest competitors are bloomberg lp refinitiv formerly part of thomson reuters and sp global market intelligence other competitors and competitive products include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications such as msci inc morningstar inc blackrock solutions and rimes technologies corporation many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those we sell our development of our own robust sets of proprietary content combined with our news and quotes offering have resulted in more direct competition with the largest financial data providers

 

despite competing products and services we enjoy high barriers to entry and believe it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases we currently offer through our indepth analytics and client service we believe we can offer clients a more complete solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities through a desktop user interface or data feed in addition our applications including our client support and service offerings are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysisscreening capabilities offered we are entrusted with significant amounts of our clients own proprietary data including portfolio holdings as a result our products have become central to our clients’ investment analysis and decisionmaking

 

intellectual property

 

we have registered trademarks and copyrights for many of our products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees clients data suppliers and vendors we seek to protect our software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws while we do not believe we are dependent on any one of our intellectual property rights we do rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect our proprietary rights despite these efforts existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection

 

research and product development costs

 

a key aspect of our growth strategy is to enhance our existing products and applications by making them faster with more reliable data we strive to rapidly to adopt new technology that can improve our products and services at factset we do not have a separate research and product development department but rather our product development and engineering departments work closely with our strategists product managers sales and other clientfacing specialists to identify areas of improvement to provide increased value to our clients research and product development costs relate to the salary and benefits for our product development software engineering and technical support staff these costs are expensed as incurred within our cost of services as employee compensation we expect to appropriate a similar percentage of our workforce and associated expenses in future years to continue to develop new products and enhancements respond quickly to market changes and meet the needs of our clients efficiently in fiscal 2018 we incurred 2171 million of research and product development costs which was comparable to our spend on similar development during fiscal years 2017 and 2016 respectively

 item 1a risk factors

 

the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition cash flows results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods investors should also refer to the other information set forth in this report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our financial statements including the related notes investors should carefully consider all risks including those disclosed before making an investment decision

 

loss corruption and misappropriation of data and information relating to clients and others

 

many of our products as well as our internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of our own as well as supplier and customer proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios and strategies breaches of this confidentiality should they occur could result in the loss of clients and termination of arrangements with suppliers for the use of their data we rely on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of data if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls unauthorized access or misappropriation of client or supplier data by an employee or an external thirdparty could occur additionally the maintenance and enhancement of our systems may not be completely effective in preventing loss unauthorized access or misappropriation data misappropriation unauthorized access or data loss could instill a lack of confidence in our products and systems and damage our brand reputation and business breaches of security measures could expose us our clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for us as well as the loss of existing or potential clients many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy and protection of personal information including the european union general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective may 25 2018 gdpr requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including our use protection and certain abilities of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenues the law in this area continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the european union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal and sensitive information related to our content operations employees clients and suppliers and may expose us to claims of violations

 

successful cyberattacks and the failure of cybersecurity systems and procedures

 

in providing our softwareenabled services to clients we rely on information technology infrastructure that is primarily managed internally along with some reliance placed on thirdparty service providers we and these thirdparty service providers are subject to the risks of system failures and security breaches including cyberattacks such as phishing scams viruses and denials of service attacks as well as employee errors or malfeasance our protective systems and procedures and those of third parties to which we are connected such as cloud computing providers may not be effective against these threats we could suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if a cyberattack or other security incident were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of clients’ or suppliers’ data other external data internal data or information technology systems if the services provided to clients were disrupted or if products or services were perceived as having security vulnerabilities the costs we would incur to address and resolve these security incidents would increase our expenses these types of security incidents could also lead to lawsuits regulatory investigations and claims loss of business and increased legal liability we also make acquisitions periodically while significant effort is placed on addressing information technology security issues with respect to the acquired companies we may inherit such risks when these acquisitions are integrated into our infrastructure

 

a prolonged or recurring outage at our data centers and other business continuity disruptions at facilities could result in reduced service and the loss of clients

 

our clients rely on us for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data and applications our business is dependent on our ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on our computerbased networks and systems our computer operations as well as our other business centers and those of our suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war civil unrest internet failures computer viruses and security breaches and other events beyond our reasonable control we maintain backup facilities and certain other redundancies for each of our major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt those operations however a loss of our services involving our significant facilities may materially disrupt our business and may induce our clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business although we seek to minimize these risks through security measures controls backup data centers and emergency planning there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective

 

 

 

competition in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share

 

we continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products with competitors ranging in size from smaller highly specialized singleproduct businesses to multibilliondollar companies while we believe the breadth and depth of our suite of products and applications offer benefits to our clients that are a competitive advantage our competitors may offer price incentives to attract new business future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions may also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries we serve could lower demand for our products clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services such as ours if our clients consolidate their spending with fewer suppliers by selecting suppliers with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data our business could be negatively affected 

 

the continued shift from active to passive investing could negatively impact user count growth and revenues

 

the predominant investment strategy today is still active investing which attempts to outperform the market the main advantage of active management is the expectation that the investment managers will be able to outperform market indices they make informed investment decisions based on their experiences insights knowledge and ability to identify opportunities that can translate into superior performance the main advantage of passive investing is that it closely matches the performance of market indices passive investing requires little decisionmaking by investment managers and low operating costs which result in lower fees for the investor while the majority of assets under management are still actively managed outflows to passively managed index funds have increased in recent years a continued shift to passive investing could reduce demand for the services of active investment managers and consequently the demand of our clients for our services

 

a decline in equity andor fixed income returns may impact the buying power of investment management clients

 

approximately 839 of our asv is derived from our investment management clients the profitability and management fees of these clients are tied to assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses the value of assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests from our clients’ customers further reducing their assets under management reduced client profits and management fees may cause our clients to cut costs moreover extended declines in the equity and fixed income markets may reduce new fund or client creation each of these developments may result in lower demand for our services and workstations from investment managers that could affect our business

 

failure to develop and market new products and enhancements that maintain our technological and competitive position and failure to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace for our products

 

the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change including methods and speed of delivery changes in client demands development of new investment instruments and evolving industry standards which can render our existing products less competitive obsolete or unmarketable as a result our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to identify and develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of our target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices we may not be successful in developing introducing marketing licensing and implementing new products and enhancements on a timely and costeffective basis or without impacting the stability and efficiency of existing products and customer systems further any new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance our failure or inability to anticipate and respond to changes in the marketplace including competitor and supplier developments may also adversely affect our business operations and growth

 

uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause us to lose clients and users

 

our investment banking clients that perform mergers and acquisitions “ma” advisory work capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 161 of our asv a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks consolidation or contraction in this industry directly impacts the number of prospective clients and users within the sector thus economic uncertainty for our global investment banking clients consolidation and business failures in this sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth

 

 

 

volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth

 

the decision on the part of large institutional clients to purchase our services often requires managementlevel sponsorship and typically depends upon the size of the client with larger clients having more complex and timeconsuming purchasing processes the process is also influenced by market volatility these characteristics often lead us to engage in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed as uncertainties in the financial markets may cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments

 

additional cost due to tax assessments resulting from ongoing and future audits by tax authorities as well as changes in tax laws

 

in the ordinary course of business we are subject to tax examinations by various governmental tax authorities the global and diverse nature of our business means that there could be additional examinations by governmental tax authorities and the resolution of ongoing and other probable audits which could impose a future risk to the results of our business in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we received a letter from the massachusetts department of revenue relating to prior tax periods the letter requested additional information in order to determine if we should have collected sales and use taxes on our sales to massachusettsbased clients based upon a preliminary review of their request it is possible that the state may assess sales and use taxes underpayment penalties and interest on previously recorded sales transactions we have not recorded a liability as of august 31 2018 while we believe that we will ultimately prevail if we are required to pay an assessment the amount could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position cash flows and results of operations

 

changes in tax laws or the terms of tax treaties in a jurisdiction where we are subject to tax could increase our taxes payable on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the act was signed into law the act enacts broad changes to the existing us internal revenue code including reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 amongst many other complex provisions the ultimate impact of such tax reform may differ from our current estimate due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as the issuance of further regulations or guidance

 

failure to identify integrate or realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions and strains on resources as a result of growth

 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices additionally there may be integration risks or other risks resulting from acquired businesses as we continue to pursue selective acquisitions to support our business strategy we seek to be a disciplined acquirer our ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from past and future acquisitions and alliances depends in part upon our ability to integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses effectively into our core business we cannot guarantee that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels anticipated in addition past and future acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt operations

 

growth such as the addition of new clients and acquisitions puts demands on our resources including our internal systems and infrastructure these may require improvements or replacement to meet the additional demands of a larger organization further the addition of new clients and the implementation of such improvements would require additional management time and resources these needs may result in increased costs that could negatively impact results of operations failure to implement needed improvements such as improved scalability could result in a deterioration in the performance of our internal systems and negatively impact the performance of our business

 

failure to enter into or renew contracts supplying new and existing data sets or products on competitive terms

 

we collect and aggregate thirdparty content from thousands of data suppliers news sources exchanges brokers and contributors into our own dedicated online service which clients access to perform their analyses clients have access to the data and content found within our databases these databases are important to our operations as they provide clients with key information we have entered into thirdparty content agreements with varying lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice some of our content provider agreements are with competitors who may attempt to make renewals difficult or expensive we seek to maintain favorable contractual relationships with our data suppliers including those that are also competitors we also make efforts when reasonable to locate alternative sources to ensure we are not dependent on any one thirdparty data supplier we believe we are not dependent on any one significant thirdparty data supplier our failure to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of our suppliers to deliver accurate data or in a timely manner could adversely affect our business

 

 

 

inability to hire and retain key qualified personnel

 

our business is based on successfully attracting motivating and retaining talented employees competition for talent especially engineering personnel is strong we need technical resources such as engineers to help develop new products and enhance existing services we rely upon sales personnel to sell our products and services and maintain healthy business relationships if we are unsuccessful in our recruiting efforts or if we are unable to retain key employees our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected and could have a material adverse effect on our business

 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products

 

each year an increasing amount of free or relatively inexpensive information becomes available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our products while we believe our service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other valueadded factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources then our business and results of operations could be adversely affected

 

third parties may claim we infringe upon their intellectual property rights or may infringe upon our intellectual property rights

 

we may receive notice from others claiming that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on favorable terms incur litigation costs enter into settlements stop selling or redesign affected products pay damages and satisfy indemnification commitments with our clients or suppliers under contractual provisions of various license arrangements additionally third parties may copy infringe or otherwise profit from unauthorized use of our intellectually property rights requiring us to litigate to protect our rights certain countries may not offer adequate protection of proprietary rights if we are required to defend ourselves or assert our rights or take such actions mentioned our operating margins may decline as a result we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk

 

operations outside the us involve additional requirements and burdens that we may not be able to control or manage successfully

 

in fiscal 2018 approximately 38 of our revenues related to operations located outside the us in addition a significant number of our employees approximately 74 are located in offices outside the us we expect our growth to continue outside the us with nonus revenues accounting for an increased portion of total revenues in the future our nonus operations involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our us operations these risks include difficulties in developing products services and technology tailored to the needs of nonus clients including in emerging markets different employment laws and rules rising labor costs in lowwage countries difficulties in staffing and managing personnel that are located outside the us different regulatory legal and compliance requirements including in the areas of privacy and data protection antibribery and anticorruption trade sanctions and currency controls marketing and sales and other barriers to conducting business social and cultural differences such as languages diverse or less stable political operating and economic environments and market fluctuations civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity limited recognition of our brand and intellectual property protection differing accounting principles and standards restrictions on or adverse tax consequences from entity management efforts and changes in us or foreign tax laws if we are not able to adapt efficiently to or manage the business effectively in markets outside the us our business prospects and operating results could be materially and adversely affected

 

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the failure of hedging arrangements

 

due to the global nature of our operations we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee japanese yen and philippine peso to the extent that our international activities increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may increase as well to manage this exposure we utilize derivative instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings with changes in foreign currency although we believe that our foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances our attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful which could cause an adverse impact on our results of operations

 

 

 

legislative and regulatory changes in the environments in which we and our clients operate

 

many of our clients operate within a highly regulated environment and must comply with governmental legislation and regulations the us regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry increased regulation of our clients may increase their expenses causing them to seek to limit or reduce their costs from outside services such as ours additionally if our clients are subjected to investigations or legal proceedings they may be adversely impacted possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reduction in assets under management or diminished operations which would adversely affect our revenues in the european union the new version of the markets in financial instruments directive also known as “mifid ii” became effective in january 2018 we believe that compliance with mifid ii requirements is timeconsuming and costly for the investment managers who are subject to it and will cause clients to adapt their pricing models and business practices significantly these increased costs may impact our clients’ spending and may cause some investment managers to lose business or withdraw from the market which may adversely affect demand for our services however mifid ii may also present us with new business opportunities for new service offerings in addition to the mifid ii requirements we further believe the proposed withdrawal of the uk from the european union also known as brexit on terms still being negotiated has created economic uncertainty among our client base this uncertainty may have an impact on our clients’ expansion or spending plans which may in turn negatively impact our revenues or growth

 

as a business we are also subject to numerous laws and regulations in the us and in the other countries in which we operate these laws rules and regulations and their interpretations may change in the future and compliance with these changes may increase our costs or cause us to make changes in or otherwise limit our business practices in addition the global nature and scope of our business operations make it more difficult to monitor areas that may be subject to regulatory and compliance risk if we fail to comply with any applicable law rule or regulation we could be subject to claims and fines and suffer reputational damage

 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations

 

we are party to lawsuits in the normal course of business litigation and governmental investigations can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings contained in part i of this report on form 10k

 

failure to maintain reputation

 

we enjoy a positive reputation in the marketplace our ability to attract and retain clients and employees is affected by external perceptions of our brand and reputation reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity could affect our ability to attract and retain clients and employees and our ability to maintain our pricing for our products although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results

the weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 was determined using the binomial model with the following weighted average assumptions

 

 

 

the riskfree interest rate assumption for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of the company’s stock and implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy factset common stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to employees the approach to utilize a mix of historical and implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on the company’s stock and the company’s assessment that a combination of implied volatility and historical volatility is best representative of future stock price trends the company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and employee termination within the valuation model the dividend yield assumption is based on the company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts the expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the binomial model the binomial model estimates employees exercise behavior based on the option’s remaining vested life and the extent to which the option is inthemoney the binomial model estimates the probability of exercise as a function of these two variables based on the entire history of exercises and cancellations of all past option grants made by the company

17 income taxes 

 

income tax expense is based on taxable income determined in accordance with current enacted laws and tax rates deferred income taxes are recorded for the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates

 

provision for income taxes

 

the provision for income taxes is as follows

 

 

 

 

 

the components of the provision for income taxes consist of the following

 

 

 

 

the provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the us statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes as a result of the following factors

 

 

 

  

  

  

   

   

 

factset’s effective tax rate is based on recurring factors and nonrecurring events including the taxation of foreign income the company’s effective tax rate will vary based on among other things changes in levels of foreign income as well as discrete and other nonrecurring events that may not be predictable on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation through the tcja the tcja significantly revises the us corporate income tax including lowering the statutory us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings and profits “ep” of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from us income taxes while the company has not finalized the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tcja factset has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on the existing us deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax the company will continue to refine its calculations as additional analyses are completed in addition the estimates may also be affected by changes in interpretations at the federal and state levels and any additional regulatory guidance that may be issued

 

factset had approximately 2500 million in undistributed foreign ep generated prior to december 31 2017 which resulted in a onetime transition tax expense of 232 million recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 payable over an eightyear period this amount may change as the company finalizes the calculation of foreign ep previously deferred from us federal taxation as well as the analysis of available foreign tax credits due to the changes in taxation of undistributed foreign earnings under the tcja factset will continue to analyze foreign subsidiary earnings as well as global working capital requirements and may repatriate earnings when the amounts are remitted substantially free of additional tax

 

 

 

due to factset’s august 31 st fiscal yearend the lower tax rate was phased in resulting in a blended us statutory federal rate of 257 for the full fiscal 2018 year and a 21 rate for subsequent years the reduction in the statutory federal rate also required the remeasurement of the company’s net us deferred tax position which resulted in a nonrecurring tax charge of 23 million the provisional expense related to the onetime transition tax on the undistributed foreign earnings and the nonrecurring tax charge from the remeasurement of deferred taxes were partially offset by the lower blended us statutory rate and the recognition of excess tax benefits from the adoption of the employee sharebased payment accounting standard

applicable accounting guidance prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition measurement classification and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return a company can recognize the financial effect of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not greater than 50 that the tax position will prevail upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position otherwise no benefit or expense can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement additionally companies are required to accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws

 

as of august 31 2018 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 92 million including 11 million of accrued interest recorded as noncurrent taxes payable within the consolidated balance sheet unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements when applicable the company adjusts the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is ultimately settled the company regularly engages in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that certain federal foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months however factset has no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes andor penalties that would have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position beyond current estimates any changes in accounting estimates resulting from new developments with respect to uncertain tax positions will be recorded as appropriate the company does not currently anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months

legal matters 

 

factset accrues non incometax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated while contingent gains are recognized only when realized the company is engaged in various legal proceedings claims and litigation that have arisen in the ordinary course of business including employment matters commercial and intellectual property litigation the outcome of all the matters against the company is subject to future resolution including the uncertainties of litigation based on information available at august 31 2018 factset’s management believes that the ultimate outcome of these unresolved matters against the company individually or in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated financial position its results of operations or its cash flows

20 risks and concentrations of credit risk

 

financial risk management

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

the company conducts business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee japanese yen and philippine peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations the company utilizes derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged factset does not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution further the company’s policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties factset’s primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency

 

 

 

interest rate risk 

 

cash and cash equivalents  the fair market value of factset’s cash and investments at august 31 2018 was 2379 million the company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value the company’s investments consist of both mutual funds and certificates of deposit as both are part of the company’s investment strategy these mutual funds and certificates of deposit are included as investments short term on the company’s consolidated balance sheet as the certificates of deposit have original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and the mutual funds can be liquidated at the company’s discretion the mutual funds and certificates of deposit are held for investment and are not considered debt securities it is anticipated that the fair market value of the company’s cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of factset’s cash and investment policy pursuant to established investment guidelines the company tries to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification its investment guidelines do not permit factset to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because the company has a restrictive investment policy its financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low the company does not believe that the value or liquidity of its cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events

 

debt  as of august 31 2018 the fair value of factset’s longterm debt was 5750 million which approximated its carrying amount and was determined based on quoted market prices for debt with a similar maturity it is anticipated that the fair market value of factset’s debt will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and the company does not believe that the value of its debt has been significantly impacted by current market events the debt bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid currently at 100 during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 the company recorded interest expense of 159 million and 84 million in interest on its outstanding debt amounts respectively assuming all terms of the company’s outstanding longterm debt remained the same a hypothetical 25 basis point change up or down in the onemonth libor rate would result in a 14 million change in its annual interest expense

 

current market events have not required the company to modify materially or change its financial risk management strategies with respect to its exposures to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk

 

concentrations of credit risk

 

cash equivalents 

 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained primarily with five financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk the company seeks to mitigate its credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties

derivative instruments 

 

as a result of the use of derivative instruments the company is exposed to counterparty credit risk factset has incorporated counterparty risk into the fair value of its derivative assets and its own credit risk into the value of the company’s derivative liabilities when applicable factset calculates credit risk from observable data related to credit default swaps “cds” as quoted by publicly available information counterparty risk is represented by cds spreads related to the senior secured debt of the respective bank with whom factset has executed these derivative transactions as cds spread information is not available for factset the company’s credit risk is determined based on using a simple average of cds spreads for peer companies to mitigate counterparty credit risk factset enters into contracts with large financial institutions and regularly reviews its credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparties the company does not expect any losses as a result of default of its counterparties

cost of services increased 164 to 6593 million compared to the prior fiscal year cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues was 488 during fiscal 2018 an increase of 240 basis points over the prior year period this increase was primarily due to higher employee compensation costs driven by increased employee headcount and restructuring actions incremental data costs from recent acquisitions and additional users as well as amortization of intangible assets associated with our recent acquisitions this increase was partially offset by a reduction in stockbased compensation expenses from accelerated vesting in the prior year

 

employee compensation including stockbased compensation when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 100 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 the increase is primarily due to the hiring of 497 net new employees over the last 12 months with the majority of their compensation recorded in cost of services due to their involvement with content collection engineering and product development employee compensation expense further increased due to headcount expansion from prior year acquisitions that were included for a full year in fiscal 2018 while fiscal 2017 only included a partial year amount in addition during fiscal 2018 we incurred 174 million of restructuring charges primarily related to severance of which 85 million was recorded within cost of services data costs when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 60 basis points due primarily from our recent acquisitions and higher variable data costs associated with additional users amortization of acquired intangible assets when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to recent acquisitions which added 932 million of intangible assets to be amortized over a weightedaverage life of 115 years these intangible assets were amortized for the full fiscal 2018 while fiscal 2017 did not include a similar amount of acquisition amortization due to the dates of each acquisition

employee compensation including stockbased compensation when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2017 the decrease is primarily related to a higher percentage of our employees working in a cost of services capacity compared to an sga role compensation for our employees within the content collection consulting product development software and systems engineering groups is recorded within cost of services while employees within our sales and various other support and administrative departments are reflected in sga in fiscal 2018 the majority of our hiring has been in departments within cost of services thus driving a higher percentage of our employee compensation in this area partially offsetting these decreases were higher legal expenses primarily from the settlement of a legal matter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 a full year of employee compensation from recent acquisitions and 89 million of severance charges

income taxes net income and diluted earnings per share 

 

  

income taxes 

 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

 

the fiscal 2018 provision for income taxes was 848 million a decrease of 15 from the same period a year ago the decrease was primarily attributable to the impacts associated with the us tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation through the tcja the tcja among other things lowered the statutory us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 due to our august 31 fiscal yearend the lower tax rate was phased in resulting in a blended us statutory federal rate of 257 for fiscal 2018 the tcja also implemented a modified territorial tax system and imposed a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings and profits “ep” of foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred from us income taxes

 

 

 

our effective tax rate was 241 for the full fiscal 2018 year compared to 250 a year ago due to higher foreign income taxed at rates lower than us rates incremental income tax benefits from rd tax credits and increased excess tax benefits from stock option exercises these benefits were partially offset by the onetime transition tax of 232 million and a 23 million tax expense associated with the remeasurement of our net us deferred tax position both of which related to the tcja we had approximately 250 million in undistributed foreign ep generated prior to december 31 2017 which resulted in the provisional amount for the onetime transition tax expense of 232 million payable over an eightyear period this amount may change as we finalize the calculation of foreign ep previously deferred from us federal taxation as well as the analysis of available foreign tax credits due to the changes in taxation of undistributed foreign earnings under the tcja we will continue to analyze foreign subsidiary earnings as well as global working capital requirements and may repatriate earnings when the amounts are remitted substantially free of additional tax in addition the estimates may also be affected by changes in interpretations at the federal and state levels and any additional regulatory guidance that may be issued

 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 

 

the fiscal 2017 provision for income taxes was 861 million down 296 compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease was primarily due to tax expense of 308 million related to the gain on sale of our market metrics business that occurred in fiscal 2016 excluding the tax impact of the gain the provision for income taxes decreased by 59 year over year related primarily to our organizational realignment as of september 1 2016 we realigned certain aspects of our global operations from factset research systems inc our us parent company to factset uk limited a uk operating company to better serve our growing client base outside the us due to the realignment we recognized a 200 basis point benefit in our annual tax rate additionally excluding the gain on sale in fiscal 2016 our provision for income taxes decreased due to a decrease in taxable income year over year this decrease was due primarily to higher interest expense incurred as a result of an increase in our outstanding debt borrowings by approximately 300 million

 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

 

fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

 

net income increased 34 to 2671 million while diluted earnings per share increased 41 to 678 during fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 net income and diluted eps grew primarily due to higher revenues from strong performances across our segments and workflow solutions gains earned from our foreign currency hedges and a decrease in our effective tax rate due to the tcja these benefits were partially offset by an increase in employee compensation expenses data costs amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions occupancy costs and interest expense associated with our outstanding debt diluted eps also benefited from a 03 million reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding due to share repurchases partially offset by stock option exercises during fiscal 2018

 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 

 

net income decreased 238 to 2583 million and diluted earnings per share decreased 205 to 651 during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 a large component of the decrease year over year was related to the aftertax gain of 817 million from the sale of the market metrics business in fiscal 2016 this gain increased diluted earnings per share by 201 excluding the fiscal 2016 aftertax gain on sale net income increased 04 year over year while diluted eps increased by 53 during fiscal 2017 net income and diluted earnings per share increased due to revenue growth of 83 year over year coupled with a reduction to the income tax provision of 296 primarily related to the gain from the sale of our market metrics business along with an organizational realignment additionally during fiscal 2017 foreign currency movements increased operating income by 71 million compared to a benefit of 116 million in the same period of fiscal 2016 these increases were partially offset by incremental employee compensation expense due to the hiring of 699 net new employees including 498 employees from acquisitions completed in the last 12 months an increase in professional fees occupancy costs computer related expenses amortization of intangibles and acquisitionrelated costs the increase in diluted earnings per share was also driven by a decrease in diluted shares outstanding as a result of continued share repurchases in fiscal 2017

 

nongaap financial measures

 

to supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we use nongaap financial measures including organic revenue adjusted operating margin adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share the reconciliations of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap are shown in tables below these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for or superior to financial measures reported in accordance with gaap moreover these nongaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with gaap other companies may calculate similarly titled nongaap financial measures differently than we do limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes

 

despite the limitations of these nongaap financial measures we believe these adjusted financial measures and the information they provide are useful in viewing our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals adjusted measures may also facilitate comparisons to our historical performance

net cash used in investing activities was 485 million in fiscal 2018 representing a 2988 million decrease from fiscal 2017 this reduction was primarily due to decreased acquisition activity with 150 million invested in fiscal 2018 compared to 3031 million largely related to the bisam technologies “bisam” and vermilion holdings limited “vermilion” acquisitions in fiscal 2017 additionally cash used in investing activities decreased year over year due to lower capital expenditures of 33 million and a decrease in the purchase of investments net of proceeds of 74 million year over year

 

during fiscal 2018 net cash used in financing activities was 3200 million representing a 3119 million increase from fiscal 2017 this increase was due to 2750 million in proceeds net of repayment from the issuance of longterm debt in fiscal 2017 that did not occur in fiscal 2018 in addition the decrease was due to higher dividend payments of 85 million an increase in share repurchases of 430 million and a change in the presentation of tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements due to the adoption of the accounting standard update which required us to disclose benefits from stock option exercises as an operating cash inflow instead of a financing activity this presentation change was adopted prospectively beginning with fiscal 2018 these cash outflows were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from employee stock plans of 216 million

 

we expect that for at least the next 12 months our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash as of august 31 2018 our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was 2086 million with 5748 million in outstanding borrowings net of 02 million of unamortized debt issuance costs approximately 309 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the us 1343 million in europe predominantly within the uk france and germany and the remaining 434 million is held in the asia pacific segment we believe our liquidity including cash on hand cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our shortterm and longterm operating requirements as they occur including working capital needs capital expenditures dividend payments stock repurchases growth objectives and other financing activities in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future

 

free cash flow generated in fiscal 2018 was 3521 million an increase of 241 compared to 2837 million in fiscal 2017 free cash flow was attributable to 2671 million of net income 870 million of noncash items 316 million of working capital changes less 335 million in capital expenditures the year over year free cash flow growth was driven by positive working capital changes totaling 476 million and lower capital expenditures of 33 million working capital improved year over year due to timing of supplier payments and payroll stabilization of our days sales outstanding “dso” at 41 days and the adoption of an accounting standard update for sharebased payments which required the presentation of benefits from stock options exercised to be reported as an operating activity when in prior periods it was reported as a financing activity

 

 

 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 

 

cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 1947 million or 138 of our total assets at august 31 2017 compared with 2284 million or 224 of our total assets at august 31 2016 our cash and cash equivalents decreased 337 million during fiscal 2017 due primarily to 3031 million in cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired 2528 million in share repurchases under the existing share repurchase program dividend payments of 809 million capital expenditures of 369 million and 74 million from the purchase of investments net of proceeds these cash outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operations of 3205 million 2750 million in net proceeds from longterm debt 500 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 103 million in tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements and 13 million from the effects of foreign currency translations

 

net cash used in investing activities was 3473 million in fiscal 2017 which represented a 1889 million increase from fiscal 2016 due primarily to an increase in the cash used in acquisitions and the purchases of investments net of proceeds partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures additionally in fiscal 2016 we recognized proceeds from the sale of our market metrics business of 1531 million acquisitions during fiscal 2017 largely related to bisam and vermilion resulted in a cash outflow of 3031 million compared to a net cash outflow of 2629 million for the portware acquisition during fiscal 2016 purchase of investments net of proceeds resulted in an increased cash outflow of 65 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease in capital expenditures of 109 million was due from the fitout of new space in new york chicago and at our corporate headquarters in norwalk in fiscal 2016fiscal 2017 capital expenditures related primarily to computer equipment for our us locations and additional expenses at our chicago new york and india locations

 

during fiscal 2017 net cash used in financing activities was 82 million compared to 910 million in fiscal 2016 this decrease was due primarily to factset entering into an accelerated share repurchase agreement the “asr agreement” to repurchase 1200 million of our common stock in july 2016 we received 595607 shares of common stock on july 5 2016 which was approximately 80 of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with our receiving an additional 102916 shares of our common stock excluding cash used in the asr agreement cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 was 290 million resulting in a fluctuation of 372 million in the current year this fluctuation was due to an increase in cash used to repurchase common stock under our existing share repurchase program of 242 million an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of 67 million lower proceeds from employee stock plans of 68 million and lower tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements of 79 million cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 16 million shares for 2528 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 15 million shares for 2323 million in fiscal 2016 dividend payments increased as our board of directors approved a 120 increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 056 per share or 224 per share per annum beginning with the dividend payment in june 2017 the year over year fluctuation was also due to additional borrowings under our 2017 credit agreement defined in capital needs  of 5750 million used to fund our acquisition of bisam on march 17 2017 and retire our existing debt of 3650 million in fiscal 2016 we borrowed 2650 million under our previous credit agreement to fund our acquisition of portware on october 16 2015 refer to the capital resources section of the mda for a discussion of our longterm debt borrowings

 

free cash flow for fiscal 2017 was 2837 million compared to 2834 million in fiscal 2016 free cash flow generated during fiscal 2017 was attributable to 2583 million of net income adjusted for 783 million of noncash items partially offset by 369 million in capital expenditures and 160 million of negative working capital changes free cash flow increased slightly from the comparable year ago period due primarily to a reduction in capital expenditures partially offset by a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was the result of higher client receivables and the timing of taxes payments our dso was 41 days as of august 31 2017 representing an increase from 31 days at august 31 2016 the increase in dso was primarily related to the acquisitions made in the year

 

capital resources

 

capital expenditures

 

capital expenditures were 335 million during fiscal 2018 down from 369 million a year ago capital expenditures of 242 million or 72 of our capital expenditures during fiscal 2018 related to upgrades to existing computer systems in norwalk additional server equipment in our data centers located in new jersey and virginia as well as laptop computers and peripherals for new and existing employees the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for the build out of office space including 22 million at our india location 28 million at our hong kong location and 15 million at our netherlands location

 

 

 

capital expenditures were 369 million during fiscal 2017 down from 477 million in fiscal 2016 approximately 214 million or 58 of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for the build out of office space including 44 million at our chicago location 44 million at our new york locations and 27 million at our india locations

 

capital needs

 

longterm debt 

 

on march 17 2017 we entered into a credit agreement the “2017 credit agreement” between factset as the borrower and pnc bank national association “pnc” as the administrative agent and lender the 2017 credit agreement provides for an unsecured 5750 million revolving credit facility the “2017 revolving credit facility” we may request borrowings under the 2017 revolving credit facility until its maturity date of march 17 2020 the 2017 credit agreement also allows us subject to certain requirements to arrange for additional borrowings with pnc for an aggregate amount of up to 2250 million provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of 250 million at our option a borrowing may be in the form of a base rate loan or a libor rate loan borrowings under the loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid currently at 100 interest on the loan outstanding is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date there are no prepayment penalties if we elect to prepay the outstanding loan amounts prior to the scheduled maturity date the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date

 

in conjunction with our entrance into the 2017 credit agreement we borrowed 5750 million in the form of a libor rate loan under the 2017 revolving credit facility proceeds from the 2017 revolving credit facility were also used to fund our acquisition of bisam

 

all outstanding loan amounts are reported as longterm debt within the consolidated balance sheet presented net of related loan origination fees at august 31 2018 the loan origination fees are amortized into interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method during fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 we recorded interest expense of 159 million 84 million and 30 million respectively on our outstanding debt amounts as of august 31 2018 no commitment fee was owed by us since we borrowed the full amount under the 2017 credit agreement

 

in fiscal 2017 factset incurred approximately 04 million in legal costs to draft and review the 2017 credit agreement these costs were capitalized as loan origination fees and are amortized into interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method

 

the 2017 credit agreement contained covenants restricting certain factset activities which are usual and customary for this type of loan in addition the 2017 credit agreement required that factset maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as measured by total funded debtebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the 2017 credit agreement as of august 31 2018 and 2017

 

as of august 31 2018 the fair value of our longterm debt was 5750 million which we believe approximated the carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis

 

letters of credit 

 

from time to time we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business approximately 20 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with our leased office spaces as of august 31 2018 these standby letters of credit contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios as of august 31 2018 and 2017 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit

 

foreign currency

 

foreign currency exposure

 

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a component of stockholders’ equity

 

 

 

over the next 12 months our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized are estimated to be 928 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are estimated to be 3245 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 2317 million our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where 74 of our employees were located as of august 31 2018 during fiscal 2018 foreign currency movements decreased operating income by 13 million compared to a 71 million increase to operating income for fiscal 2017

 

foreign currency hedges

 

as of august 31 2018 we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposures

 

  

  

  

  

as of august 31 2018 the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase philippine pesos with us dollars was php 28 billion to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was rs 36 billion to purchase euros with us dollars was € 220 million and to purchase british pound sterling with us dollars was £140 million

 

there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31 2018 a gain on derivatives of 31 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2018 compared to a loss of 29 million in fiscal 2017

 

offbalance sheet arrangements

 

at august 31 2018 and 2017 we had no offbalance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating offbalance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes

 

share repurchase program

 

repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions in fiscal 2018 we repurchased 15 million shares for 3024 million compared to 16 million shares for 2528 million in fiscal 2017 under the existing share repurchase program over the last 12 months we have returned 3934 million to stockholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends on march 26 2018 our board of directors approved a 3000 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program subsequent to this expansion 4312 million is available for future share repurchases as of august 31 2018 2417 million is available for future share repurchases under the existing share repurchase program

 

contractual obligations

 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here as of august 31 2018 we had total purchase commitments of 790 million which was comparable to the prior year commitments of 810 million reflecting no material changes with suppliers during fiscal 2018

 

 

 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2018 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

  

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are received as well as due to changes to agreedupon amounts for any of our obligations

 

on february 14 2018 we entered into a new lease to relocate our corporate headquarters to 45 glover avenue in norwalk connecticut the new location will comprise approximately 173000 square feet of office space we expect to take possession of the newly leased property on or around january 1 2019 for fitout purposes we will continue to occupy our existing headquarters space until the new headquarters property is ready for occupancy currently estimated to be in the second quarter of fiscal 2020

 

including new lease agreements executed during fiscal 2018 our worldwide leased office space increased to approximately 1750000 square feet at august 31 2018 up 607000 square feet or 540 from august 31 2017 this increase was primarily related to additional office space in the philippines and the new headquarters lease signed in february 2018 future minimum requirements for our operating leases in place as of august 31 2018 totaled 4078 million an increase from 2817 million as of august 31 2017 primarily due to the additional office space in the philippines and new leased space for headquarters in norwalk connecticut mentioned above

 

as disclosed earlier in the capital resources section of this mda we entered into the 2017 credit agreement on march 17 2017 and borrowed 5750 million in conjunction with the 2017 credit agreement factset retired its outstanding loan amount of 3650 million under the previous credit agreement

 

with the exception of the new leases entered in the ordinary course of business there were no other significant changes to our contractual obligations during fiscal 2018

 

dividends

 

on may 7 2018 our board of directors approved a 143 increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment on june 19 2018 which was 064 per share with our dividends and our share repurchases in the aggregate we have returned 3934 million to stockholders over the past 12 months future cash dividends will depend on our earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors we consider relevant dividends must be authorized by our board of directors

 

 

 

during fiscal years 2018 and 2017 our board of directors declared the following dividends on our common stock

 

  

all the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources on a quarterly basis

 

significant accounting policies

 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below

 

critical accounting estimates

 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements

 

business combinations

 

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate include assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms our significant assumptions and estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates

 

performancebased equity awards

 

performancebased stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets the number of performancebased options that vest will be predicated on us achieving performance levels during the measurement period subsequent to the date of grant depending on the financial performance levels we achieve a percentage of the performancebased stock options will vest to the grantees of those stock options however there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part

 

february 2015 performancebased option grant review 

 

in connection with the acquisition of code red we granted 68761 performancebased stock options during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 that are eligible to cliff vest based on a fouryear measurement period ending february 28 2019 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we modified the vesting criteria of the grant which resulted in 40 of the options being deemed eligible to vest with the remaining options forfeited no cumulative catchup adjustment was required because we had expected the 40 level to be achieved the option holders must remain employed by factset through february 28 2019 for the options to vest as of august 31 2018 total unamortized stockbased compensation of 04 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 04 years

 

 

 

january 2017 performancebased option grant review 

 

in connection with the acquisition of vermilion we granted 61744 performancebased stock options in january 2017 these performancebased options will vest 40 on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20 on each subsequent anniversary date if certain vermilion revenue and operating income targets are achieved by november 30 2018 the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest as of august 31 2018 we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved and as such no stockbased compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performancebased options a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by vermilion in future periods could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense

 

  

   

june 2017 performancebased option grant review 

 

in connection with the acquisition of bisam we granted 206417 performancebased stock options in june 2017 these performancebased options will vest 40 on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20 on each subsequent anniversary date if certain bisam revenue and operating income targets are achieved by march 31 2019 the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest as of august 31 2018 we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved and as such no stockbased compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performancebased options a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by bisam in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense

 

   

  

accrued compensation

 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation annual cashbased awards that are variable and discretionary in nature represent approximately 10 of our company’s employee incentive compensation program we conduct a final review of company departmental and individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate as of august 31 2018 and 2017 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was 436 million and 392 million respectively

 

goodwill and intangible assets

 

goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life at least annually we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment and if impaired write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the us europe and asia pacific which is aligned with how the chief operating decision making group “codmg” composed of the ceo and executive management manages the business and the demographic markets we serve the three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries or business units within each operating segment the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units including assigning assets liabilities goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit

 

 

 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations we have not made any material changes in our impairment analysis methodology during the past three fiscal years while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset

 

we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 consistent with the timing of previous years it was determined that there was no impairment with the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2018 and 2017 was 7018 million and 7076 million respectively

 

our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases client relationships software technology noncompete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions which have been fully integrated into our operations we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives which are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization the weighted average useful life of our acquired identifiable intangible assets at august 31 2018 was 115 years if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented these intangible assets had no assigned residual values as of august 31 2018 and 2017

 

intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset no indicators of impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31 2018 and 2017 was 1489 million and 1735 million respectively

 

longlived assets

 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described here there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets was 1005 million in both years ended august 31 2018 and 2017

 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material

 

 

 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies

 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and domestic production activities deductions our annual effective tax rate was 241 250 and 265 in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

 

we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements

 

as of august 31 2018 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 92 million including 11 million of accrued interest recorded as taxes payable noncurrent within the consolidated balance sheet unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements when applicable we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled if recognized the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statements of income audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes for this reason we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest

 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition

approximately 839 of our asv is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but also could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover a shift from active investment management to passive investment management can result in lower demand for our services our investment banking clients that provide ma advisory work capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 161 of our asv a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulgebracket banks credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations our clients could also encounter similar issues a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in ma funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma capital markets and equity research to compensate for the challenges faced by other departments

 

 

 

brexit

 

volatility is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the european union the initial uk economic performance has been stronger than originally expected as the timeframe from the initial vote increases additionally increased european confidence and uk consumer spending has contributed to the recovery of the economic outlook the negotiation process is continuing including the latest milestone of the uk and european union developing a draft of the legal text for the transition deal any impact from brexit on us will depend in part on the longerterm outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results while we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets

 

mifid ii

 

in the european union the new version of the markets in financial instruments directive also known as mifid ii became effective in january 2018 the main purpose of this initiative was to ensure fairer safe and more efficient markets and facilitate greater transparency for all participants the research workflow is one area where both buyside and sellside clients have seen and will continue to see significant change requirements as a result of the mifid ii inducement rules the goal of the new legislative framework is to strengthen investor protection and improve the functioning of financial markets making them more efficient resilient and transparent new reporting requirements and tests will increase the amount of information available and reduce the use of dark pools and otc trading mifid ii requirements have meant pricing models and business practices have had to adapt significantly we will continue to evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to mifid ii and partner with our clients to help them navigate these new rules however recently we have noticed a substantial interest in our research workflow which is part of the opportunity for us but more importantly allows our clients to leverage our technology solutions for mifid ii compliance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations

 

foreign currency exchange risk

 

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee japanese yen and philippine peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses over the next 12 months our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized are estimated to be 928 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are estimated to be 3245 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 2317 million to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency

 

foreign currency hedges

 

as of august 31 2018 we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposures

 

  

  

  

  

as of august 31 2018 the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase philippine pesos with us dollars was php 28 billion to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was rs 36 billion to purchase euros with us dollars was € 220 million and to purchase british pound sterling with us dollars was £140 million

 

there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31 2018 a gain on derivatives of 31 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2018 compared to a loss of 29 million in fiscal 2017the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings the related cash flow impacts of all our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities

 

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2018 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 73 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base if we had no hedges in place as of august 31 2018 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2018 would result in a decrease in operating income by 288 million over the next 12 months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2018 would increase the fair value of total assets by 653 million and equity by 612 million

 

 

 

volatility in the british pound sterling exchange rate is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the european union in the longer term any impact from brexit will depend on in part on the outcome of tariff regulatory and other negotiations

 

interest rate risk

 

cash and cash equivalents 

 

the fair market value of our cash and investments at august 31 2018 was 2379 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value our investments consist of both mutual funds and certificates of deposits as both are part of our investment strategy these mutual funds and certificates of deposits are included as investments shortterm on our consolidated balance sheet as the mutual funds can be liquidated at our discretion and the certificates of deposit have original maturities greater than three months but less than one year the mutual funds and certificates are held for investment and are not considered debt securities it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events

 

debt

 

as of august 31 2018 the fair value of our longterm debt was 5750 million which approximated its carrying amount and was determined based on quoted market prices for debt with a similar maturity it is anticipated that the fair market value of our debt will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and we do not believe that the value of our debt has been significantly impacted by current market events the debt bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus a spread using a debt leverage pricing grid currently at 100 during fiscal years 2018 2017 and 2016 we recorded interest expense of 159 million 84 million and 30 million respectively on our outstanding debt amounts assuming all terms of our outstanding longterm debt remained the same a hypothetical 25 basis point change up or down in the onemonth libor rate would result in a 14 million change in our annual interest expense

data centers

 

factset ’s business is dependent on its ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on its networks and systems the company’s global technology infrastructure supports its operations and is designed to facilitate the reliable and efficient processing and delivery of data and analytics to its clients factset’s data centers contain multiple layers of redundancy to enhance system performance including maintaining processing and storing data at multiple data centers user connections are load balanced between data centers in the event of a site failure equipment problem or localized disaster the remaining center has the capacity to handle the additional load factset continues to be focused on maintaining a global technological infrastructure that allows the company to support its growing business

the competitive landscape

 

factset is part of the financial information services industry which provides accurate financial information and software solutions to the global investment community this extremely competitive market is comprised of both large wellcapitalized companies and smaller niche firms including market data suppliers news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply the company with financial information included in the factset workstation the largest competitors to factset are bloomberg lp thomson reuters inc and sp global market intelligence other competitors and competitive products include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications such as msci inc morningstar inc blackrock solutions rimes technologies corporation and wilshire associates inc many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those sold by the company factset’s development of its own robust sets of proprietary content combined with its news and quotes offering have resulted in more direct competition with the largest financial data providers 

 

despite competing products and services factset enj oys high barriers to entry and believes it would be difficult for another vendor to replicate quickly the extensive databases the company currently offers through its indepth analytics and superior client service factset believes it can offer clients a more complete solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities through a desktop user interface or data feed in addition factsets applications including its client support and service offerings are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysisscreening capabilities offered the company is entrusted with significant amounts of our clients own proprietary data including portfolio holdings as a result the companys products have become central to investment analysis and decisionmaking for clients 

 

intellectual property

 

factset has registered trademarks and copyrights for many of its products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional tradem arks and copyrights as appropriate factset enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees clients data suppliers and vendors the company seeks to protect its software documentation and other written materials under trade secret copyright and patent laws while factset does not believe it is dependent on any one of its intellectual property rights the company does rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect its proprietary rights despite these efforts existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection 

 

research and product development costs

 

a key aspect of the company ’s growth strategy is to enhance its existing products and applications by making them faster and the data within them more reliable factset strives rapidly to adopt new technology that can improve its products and services factset does not have a separate research and product development department but rather the product development and engineering departments work closely with the sales function to identify areas of improvement with the goal of providing increased value to clients as such research and product development costs relate to the salary and benefits for the company’s product development software engineering and technical support staff and as such these costs are expensed when incurred within cost of services as employee compensation the company expects to allocate a similar percentage of its workforce in future years in order to continue to develop new products and enhancements respond quickly to market changes and meet the needs of its clients efficiently factset incurred 2150 million of research and product development costs during fiscal 2017 which was comparable to its spend on similar development during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively

additional information

 

additional information with respect to the company ’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

   

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 

 

risk factors which could cause future financial performanc e to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset’s forwardlooking statements made by or on the company’s behalf include without limitation 

 

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data

many of factset ’s products as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur  this data misappropriation could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of company security measures could expose factset its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company’s brand and reputation 

 

factset must continue to introduce new products and enhancements to maintain its technological position

the ma rket for factset is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards  which can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis and they may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements 

 

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel

the company ’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for talent including engineering personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships factset’s failure to attract and retain talented employees could have a material  adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

a decline in equity andor fixed income returns may impact the buying power of investment management clients

approximately 8 4 1 of the company’s annual subscription value “asv” is derived from its investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

 

uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause factset to lose clients and users

factset ’s sellside clients that perform ma advisory work capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 159 of its asv a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks while improvements have been observed in the current fiscal year the global investment banking industry continues to experience uncertainty and consolidation which directly impacts the number of prospective clients and users within the sector a lack of available credit would impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect the company’s financial results and future growth 

 

 

 

a dramatic shift from active to passive investing could negatively impact user count growth

the predominant investment strategy today is active investing which attempts to outperform the market the goal of active management is to beat a particular benchmark the majority of assets under management are actively managed analyzing market trends the economy and the companyspecific factors active managers are constantly searching out information and gathering insights to help them make their investment decisions passive management or indexing is an investment management approach based on investing in exactly the same securities and in the same proportions as an index such dow jones industrial average or the sp 500 it is called passive because portfolio managers do not make decisions about which securities to buy and sell the managers merely follow the same methodology of constructing a portfolio as the index uses the main advantage of active management is the expectation that the managers will be able to outperform the index due to their superior skills they can make informed investment decisions based on their experiences insights knowledge and ability to identify opportunities that can translate into superior performance the main advantage of passive investing is that it closely matches the performance of the index passive investing requires little decisionmaking by the manager the manager tries to duplicate the chosen index tracking it as efficiently as possible this results in lower operating costs that are passed on to the investor in the form of lower fees approximately 841 of the company’s asv is derived from its investment management clients in the past decade passively managed index funds have seen greater investor interest and this trend has become more dramatic in recent years a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for factset’s products and services 

 

competition in factset’s industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share

factset continues to experience intense com petition across all markets for its products with competitors ranging in size from smaller highly specialized singleproduct businesses to multibillion dollar companies while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors may offer price incentives to attract new business future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions may also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services in recent years factset has seen clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors by selecting vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

failure to maintain reputation

factset enjoys a positive reputation in the marketplace factset’s ability to attract and retain customers is affected by external perceptions of its brand and reputation reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity could affect factset’s ability to attract and retain clients and employees and its ability to price its products at their full value although the company monitors developments for areas of potential risk to its reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on factset’s business and financial results 

 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for factset

each year an increasing amount of free or relatively inexpensive information becomes available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for factset’s products while the company believes its service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other added value factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources factset’s business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

 

 

factset’s international operations involve special risks

in 2 017 approximately 36 of factset’s revenue related to operations located outside of the us in addition a significant number of its employees 73 are located in offices outside of the us the company expects to continue its international growth with international revenue accounting for an increased portion of total revenue in the future the company’s international operations involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by its us operations these risks include difficulties in developing products services and technology tailored to the needs of clients around the world including in emerging markets different employment laws and rules and related social and cultural factors different regulatory and compliance requirements including in the areas of privacy and data protection antibribery and anticorruption trade sanctions marketing and sales and other barriers to conducting business cultural and language differences diverse or less stable political operating and economic environments and market fluctuations civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity limited recognition of factset’s brand differing accounting principles and standards restrictions on or adverse tax consequences from entity management efforts and unexpected changes in us or foreign tax laws if the company is not able to efficiently adapt to or effectively manage the business in markets outside of the us its business prospects and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in particular political tension has been increasing in manila the philippines civil unrest in manila may make it difficult or impossible for factset to continue its operations there although factset has tested business continuity plans in place for its operations there an extended period of civil unrest that halts or significantly impedes operations could have a material adverse effect on the company 

 

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows

the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as 73 of factset’s employees and 54 of its leased office space were located outside the us at august 31 2017 these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial results and cash flows the company’s primary exposures relate to expenses denominated in british pound sterling euro indian rupee japanese yen and philippine peso this exposure has increased over the past 12 months primarily as the company’s international employee base has increased both organically and due to the fiscal 2017 acquisitions by 613 net new employees a 10 increase since august 31 2016  factset’s nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next 12 months are estimated to be approximately 9 0 million  while its nonus dollar denominated expenses are estimated to be approximately 30 0 million resulting in a net foreign currency exposure of approximately 21 0 million although factset believes that its foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances the company’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful which could cause an adverse impact on its results of operations 

 

volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth

sales cycles for factset may fluctuate and be extended in times where the financial markets are volatile the decision to purchase the factset service often requires managementlevel sponsorship  which often leads factset to engage in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed as uncertainties in the financial markets may cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments the cycle associated with the purchase of the company’s service offerings typically depends upon the size of the client 

 

failure to identify integrate or realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions

factset may be unable to successfully identify acquisitions or may experience integration or other risks resulting from its acquisitions leading to an adverse effect on its financial results as the company continues to pursue selective acquisitions to support its business and growth strategy it seeks to be a disciplined acquirer  there can be no assurance that it will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices in addition the company’s ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from past and future acquisitions and alliances depends in part upon its ability to effectively integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into factset’s core business the company cannot assure its acquired businesses will perform at the levels anticipated in addition past and future acquisitions may subject the company to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt operations 

 

a prolonged or recurring outage at factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients

factset ’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations however a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

 

 

 

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing data sets or products

factset aggregates third party content from thousands of data suppliers news sources exchanges brokers and contributors into its own dedicated online service which cli ents access to perform their analyses clients have access to the data and content found within the factset databases these databases are important to the company’s operations as they provide clients with key information factset has entered into third party content agreements with varying lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice factset seeks to maintain favorable contractual relationships with its data suppliers the company makes every effort when reasonable to locate alternative sources to ensure factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier factset believes it is not dependent on any one third party data supplier the failure of factset to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

 

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms enter into settlements stop selling or redesign affected products pay damages or satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients or vendors under contractual provisions of various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue incurring expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

 

changes in securities laws and regulations may increase expenses or may harm demand

many of factset ’s clients operate within a highly regulated environment in light of the recent conditions in the us financial markets and economy the us congress and federal regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry the information provided by or resident in the service factset provides to its clients could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving its clients which could result in requests for information from factset that could be expensive and time consuming in addition clients subject to investigations or legal proceedings may be adversely impacted  possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reductions in assets under management or diminished operations that would adversely affect the company’s revenues 

 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset’s operating results

factset is party to lawsuits in the normal course of business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings  contained in part i of this report

key metrics

  

the following is a review of our key metrics

during fiscal 2016 net cash used in financing activities was 910 mil lion compared to 1873 million in fiscal 2015 the year over year decrease in cash used was primarily due to proceeds from longterm debt of 2650 million  offset by an increase in cash used in share repurchases of 1006 million lower proceeds and tax benefits from stock options exercised of 254 million  and an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of 77 million the proceeds from longterm debt related to additional borrowings under our previous credit agreement used to fund our acquisition of portware on october 16 2015 cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 15 million shares for 2323 million under the existing share repurchase program and 06 million shares for 1200 million related to the asr agreement entered into in july 2016 we repurchased 17 million shares for 2528 million in fiscal 2015 under the existing share repurchase program dividend payments increased as our board of directors approved a 136 increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 050 per share or 200 per share per annum  beginning with the dividend payment in june 2016

capital needs

 

longterm debt 

 

on march 17 2017 the company entered into a credit agreement the “ 2017 credit agreement” between factset as the borrower and pnc bank national association “pnc” as the administrative agent and lender the 2017 credit agreement provides for a 5750 million revolving credit facility the “2017 revolving credit facility” we may request borrowings under the 2017 revolving credit facility until its maturity date of march 17 2020 the 2017 credit agreement also allows factset subject to certain requirements to arrange for additional borrowings with pnc for an aggregate amount of up to 2250 million provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of 250 million at our option a borrowing may be in the form of a base rate loan or a libor rate loan borrowings under the loan bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus 100 interest on the loan outstanding is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date there are no prepayment penalties if we elect to prepay the outstanding loan amounts prior to the scheduled maturity date the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date 

 

in conjunction with factset ’s entrance into the 2017 credit agreement the company borrowed 5750 million in the form of a libor rate loan under the 2017 revolving credit facility and retired the outstanding debt under its previous credit agreement between factset as the borrower and bank of america na as the lender the total principal amount of the debt outstanding at the time of retirement was 3650 million and there were no prepayment penalties proceeds from the 2017 revolving credit facility were also used to fund factset’s acquisition of bisam 

 

all outstanding loan amounts are reported as longterm debt within the consolidated balance sheet at august 31 2017  during fiscal 2017 and 2016 we paid approximately 84 million and 31 million respectively in interest on our outstanding loan amounts the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date 

 

as of august 31 2017 no commitment fee was owed by factset since it borrowed the full amount under the 2017 credit agreement in fiscal 2017 factset incurred approximately 04 million in legal costs to draft and review the 2017 credit agreement these costs were capitalized as loan origination fees and are amortized into interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 

 

the 2017 credit agreement contained covenants restricting certain factset activities which are usual and customary for this type of loan in addition the 2017 credit agreement required that factset maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as measured by total funded debtebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter the company was in compliance with all of the covenants of the 2017 credit agreement as of august 31 2017 

 

as of august 31 2017 the fair value of our longterm debt was 5750 million which we believe approximates carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis 

 

letters of credit 

 

from time to time we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business approx imately 19 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with various current leased office spaces as of august 31 2017 these standby letters of credit contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios as of august 31 2017 and 2016 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit 

 

 

 

foreign currency

 

foreign currency exposure 

 

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial s tatements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity 

 

as of august 31 2017 our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized are estimated to be approximately 90 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are approximately 300 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of approximately 210 million per year our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where 73 of our employees were located as of august 31 2017  during fiscal 2017 foreign currency movements decreased operating income by 71 million compared to 116 million a year ago 

 

f oreign currency hedges 

 

as of august 31 201 7 factset maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75 of its indian rupee exposure through the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was rs 38 billion 

 

there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31 2017 a loss on derivatives of 29 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2017 compared to a loss of 05 million in fiscal 2016  

 

offbalance sheet arrangements

on july 1 2016 we entered into an asr agreement to repurchase 1200 million of our common stock we received 595607 shares of common stock on july 5 2016 which was approximately 80 of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with us receiving an additional 102916 shares of our common stock 

 

contractual obligations

 

fluct uations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are mere ly indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreedupon amounts for any of our obligations 

 

at august 31 2017 we leased approximately 1143000 square feet of office space which we believe is adequate for our current needs and that additional space is available for lease to meet any future needs including new lease agreements executed during fiscal 2017 our worldwideleased office space increased by approximately 71000 square feet or 7 from august 31 2016 this increase was primarily due to leases related to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017 as well as expanded office space in india offset by the consolidation of certain other office spaces 

 

as disclosed earlier in the capital resources section of this mda factset entered into the 2017 credit agreement on march 17 2017 and borrowed 575 0 million in conjunction with the 2017 credit agreement factset retired its outstanding loan amount of 3650 million under the previous credit agreement

significant accounting policies

 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

 

critical accounting estimates

 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was m ade and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

 

business combinations

 

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of th e assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms our significant assumptions and estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

 

performancebased equity awards

 

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which allows for the issuance of per formancebased equity awards to employees accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performancebased equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest at the end of each reporting period management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels however there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part 

 

february 2015 performancebased option grant review 

 

in connection with the acquisition of code red we granted 137522 performancebased stock options during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 of the total amount granted 68761 performancebased options were eligible to vest if certain code red asv and operating margin targets were achieved over a twoyear measurement period ending february 28 2017 at the conclusion of the measurement period 70 of the options were deemed eligible to vest with the remaining options being forfeited the option holders must remain employed by factset through february 28 2019 in order for the options to vest as of august 31 2017 total unamortized stockbased compensation of 08 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 14 years

accrued compensation

 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 15 of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate as of august 31 2017 and 2016 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was 392 million and 382 million respectively 

 

goodwill and intangible assets

 

goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life at least annuall y we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment and if impaired write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the us europe and asia pacific which is aligned with how the chief operating decision making group “codmg” composed of the ceo and senior management manages the business and the demographic markets in which factset serves the three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units including assigning assets liabilities  goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 

 

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations we have not made any material changes in our impairment analysis methodology during the past three fiscal years while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset 

 

we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 201 7 consistent with previous years it was determined that there was no impairment with the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2017 and 2016  was 7076 million and 4529 million respectively 

 

our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases clie nt relationships software technology noncompete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions which have been fully integrated into our operations depending on the nature of the intangible asset it is amortized on either a straightline or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty years these useful lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31 2017 and 2016 

 

 

 

intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset no indicators of impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31 2017 and 2016  was 1735 million and 932 million respectively 

 

longlived assets

 

longliv ed assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described here there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2017 and 2016  was 1005 million and 846 million respectively 

 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management t o make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies

 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an esti mate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and domestic production activities deductions our annual effective tax rate was 250 265 and 278 in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

 

we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements 

 

 

 

as of august 31 201 7 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 115 million including 15 million of accrued interest recorded as taxes payable noncurrent within the consolidated balance sheet unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements when applicable we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled if recognized the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statements of income audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes for this reason we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles includ ing accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

 

new accounting pronouncements

 

see note 3 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption which we include here by reference 

 

market trends

 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to fin ancial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations 

 

approximately 841 of our asv is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment management clients our investment banking clients that perform ma advisory work provide capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 159 of our asv a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in ma funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments 

 

due to the global nature of our operations we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro i ndian rupee japanese yen and philippine peso to the extent that our international activities increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage this exposure we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency 

 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the global markets and currencies had been adversely impacted including a sharp decline in the value of the british pound sterling as compared to the us dollar at that time volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu the uk inflation rate has also experienced significant price level increase compared to the past four years as the negotiation process continues and the timeframe from the initial vote increases the uk economic performance has been stronger than originally expected increased european confidence and uk consumer spending has contributed to the recovery of the economic outlook in the longer term as negotiations continue any impact from brexit on us will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results while we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets our products including our datasets such as georev allow our clients to understand geographic exposure and assess the risks of operating on a global scale so they may make informed business decisions

first quarter fiscal 201 8 expectations 

 

  

  

  

  

dividend payment

 

on august 10 2017  we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 056 per share the cash dividend of 219 million was paid on september 19 2017 to common stockholders of record on august 31 2017 using our existing cash generated by operations 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations

 

foreign currency exchange risk

 

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee japanese yen and philippine peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using pe riodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses over the next 12 months our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized are estimated to be approximately 90 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are approximately 300 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of approximately 210 million per year to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency 

 

as of august 31 201 7 factset maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75 of its indian rupee exposure through the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was rs 38 billion  

 

there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31 2017 a loss on derivatives of 29 million was recorded into operating income in fiscal 2017 compared to a loss of 05 million a year ago the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings the related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 

 

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2017 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 54 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base had we not had any hedges in place as of august 31 2017 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2017 would result in a decrease in operating income by 203 million over the next 12 months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2017 would increase the fair value of total assets by 695 million and equity by 619 million 

 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted including a sharp decline in the value of the british pound sterling as compared to the us dollar volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu in the longer term any impact from brexit on us will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results 

 

 

 

interest rate risk

 

cash and cash equivalents   

 

the fair market value of our cash and investments at august 31 2017  was 2272 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value our investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and as such are classified as investments within our consolidated balance sheet it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events 

 

debt

 

as of august 31 2017 the fair value of our longterm debt was 5750 million which approximated its carrying amount given its floating interest rate basis and was determined based on quoted market prices for debt with a similar maturity it is anticipated that the fair market value of our debt will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and we do not believe that the value of our debt has been significantly impacted by current market events the debt bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the daily libor rate plus 100 during fiscal 2017 we paid 84 million in interest on our outstanding loan amount compared to 31 million in the prior year assuming all terms of our outstanding longterm debt remained the same a hypothetical 25 basis point change up or down in the onemonth libor rate would result in a 14 million change in our annual interest expense

additional information 

  

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

   

 

 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 

  

risk factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset’s forwardlooking statements made by or on the company’s behalf include without limitation 

  

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

  

many of factset’s products as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of company security measures could expose factset its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company’s brand and reputation 

  

factset must continue to introduce new products and enhancements to maintain its technological position 

  

the market for factset is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards which can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis and they may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements 

  

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

  

the company’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for talent including engineering personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships factset’s failure to attract and retain talented employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

  

a decline in equity andor fixed income returns may impact the buying power of investment management clients 

  

approximately 826 of the company’s annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

  

uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause factset to lose clients and users 

  

factset’s sellside clients that perform ma advisory work capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 174 of its revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks while improvements have been observed in the current fiscal year the global investment banking industry continues to experience uncertainty and consolidation which directly impacts the number of prospective clients and users within the sector a lack of available credit would impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect the company’s financial results and future growth 

  

 

 

  

a dramatic shift from active to passive investing could negatively impact user count growth 

  

the predominant investment strategy today is active investing which attempts to outperform the market the goal of active management is to beat a particular benchmark the majority of mutual funds are actively managed analyzing market trends the economy and the companyspecific factor active managers are constantly searching out information and gathering insights to help them make their investment decisions passive management or indexing is an investment management approach based on investing in exactly the same securities and in the same proportions as an index such dow jones industrial average or the sp 500 it is called passive because portfolio managers dont make decisions about which securities to buy and sell the managers merely follow the same methodology of constructing a portfolio as the index uses the main advantage of active management is the possibility that the managers will be able to outperform the index due to their superior skills they can make informed investment decisions based on their experiences insights knowledge and ability to identify opportunities that can translate into superior performance the main advantage of passive investing is that it closely matches the performance of the index passive investing requires little decisionmaking by the manager the manager tries to duplicate the chosen index tracking it as efficiently as possible this results in lower operating costs that are passed on to the investor in the form of lower fees approximately 826 of the company’s annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management in the past decade passively managed index funds have seen greater investor interest and this trend has become more dramatic in recent years a continued lessening of investor interest in actively managed equity funds could decrease demand for factset’s products and services 

  

competition in factset’s industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

  

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products with competitors ranging in size from smaller highly specialized singleproduct businesses to multibillion dollar companies while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors may offer price incentives to attract new business future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions may also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services in recent years factset has seen clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors by selecting vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

failure to maintain reputation 

  

factset enjoys a positive reputation in the marketplace factset’s ability to attract and retain customers is affected by external perceptions of its brand and reputation reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity could affect factset’s ability to attract and retain clients and employees and its ability to price its products at their full value although the company monitors developments for areas of potential risk to its reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on factset’s business and financial results 

  

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for factset 

  

each year an increasing amount of free or relatively inexpensive information becomes available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for factset’s products while the company believes its service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other added value factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources factset’s business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

 

 

  

factset’s international operations involve special risks 

  

in 2016 approximately 33 of factset’s revenue related to operations located outside of the us in addition a significant number of its employees 71 are located in offices outside of the us the company expects to continue its international growth with international revenue accounting for an increased portion of total revenue in the future the company’s international operations involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by its us operations these risks include difficulties in developing products services and technology tailored to the needs of clients around the world including in emerging markets different employment laws and rules and related social and cultural factors different regulatory and compliance requirements including in the areas of privacy and data protection antibribery and anticorruption trade sanctions marketing and sales and other barriers to conducting business cultural and language differences diverse or less stable political operating and economic environments and market fluctuations civil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity limited recognition of factset’s brand differing accounting principles and standards restrictions on or adverse tax consequences from entity management efforts and unexpected changes in us or foreign tax laws if the company is not able to efficiently adapt to or effectively manage the business in markets outside of the us its business prospects and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in particular political tension has been increasing in manila the philippines due to comments and the behavior over the last few months of rodrigo duterte president of the philippines increasing civil unrest in manila may make it difficult or impossible for factset to continue its operations there although factset has tested business continuity plans in place for its operations there an extended period of civil unrest that halts or significantly impedes operations could have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows 

  

the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as 71 of factset’s employees and 48 of its leased office space were located outside the us at august 31 2016 these exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial results and cash flows the company’s primary exposures relate to expenses denominated in british pound sterling euro indian rupee japanese yen and philippine peso this exposure has increased over the past 12 months primarily as the company’s international employee base has risen 17 since august 31 2015 factset’s nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next 12 months are estimated to be 200 million  while its nonus dollar denominated expenses are estimated to be 2133 million resulting in a net foreign currency exposure of 1933 million although factset believes that its foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances the company’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful which could cause an adverse impact on its results of operations 

  

volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth 

  

sales cycles for factset may fluctuate and be extended in times where the financial markets are volatile the decision to purchase the factset service often requires managementlevel sponsorship  which often leads factset to engage in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed as uncertainties in the financial markets may cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments the cycle associated with the purchase of the company’s service offerings typically depends upon the size of the client 

  

failure to identify integrate or realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions 

  

factset may be unable to successfully identify acquisitions or may experience integration or other risks resulting from its acquisitions leading to an adverse effect on its financial results as the company continues to pursue selective acquisitions to support its business and growth strategy it seeks to be a disciplined acquirer there can be no assurance that it will be able to identify suitable candidates for successful acquisition at acceptable prices in addition the company’s ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from past and future acquisitions and alliances depends in part upon its ability to effectively integrate the offerings technology sales administrative functions and personnel of these businesses into factset’s core business the company cannot assure its acquired businesses will perform at the levels anticipated in addition past and future acquisitions may subject the company to unanticipated risks or liabilities or disrupt operations 

  

a prolonged or recurring outage at factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

  

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations however a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

  

 

 

  

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing data sets or products 

  

factset aggregates third party content from more than 220 data suppliers 115 news sources and 85 exchanges clients have access to the data and content found within the factset databases these databases are important to the company’s operations as they provide clients with key information factset has entered into third party content agreements with varying lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice factset seeks to maintain favorable contractual relationships with its data suppliers the company makes every effort when reasonable to locate alternative sources to ensure factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier factset believes it is not dependent on any one third party data supplier the failure of factset to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights 

  

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms enter into settlements stop selling or redesign affected products pay damages or satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients or vendors under contractual provisions of various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue incurring expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

  

changes in securities laws and regulations may increase expenses or may harm demand 

  

many of factset’s clients operate within a highly regulated environment in light of the recent conditions in the us financial markets and economy the us congress and federal regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry the information provided by or resident in the service factset provides to its clients could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving its clients which could result in requests for information from factset that could be expensive and time consuming in addition clients subject to investigations or legal proceedings may be adversely impacted  possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reductions in assets under management or diminished operations that would adversely affect the company’s revenues 

  

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset’s operating results 

  

factset is party to lawsuits in the normal course of business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings  contained in part i of this report

provision for income taxes 

  

the provision for income taxes is as follows 

    

     

 

 

  

the components of the provision for income taxes consist of the following

unrecognized tax positions 

  

applicable accounting guidance prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition measurement classification and disclosure of uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return a company can recognize the financial effect of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not greater than 50 that the tax position will prevail upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position otherwise no benefit or expense can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement additionally companies are required to accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws 

  

as of august 31 2016 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 88 million including 13 million of accrued interest recorded as taxes payable noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet as of august 31 2015 the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 68 million including 13 million of accrued interest recorded as taxes payable noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet the company recognizes interest and penalty charges related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense which is consistent with the recognition in prior reporting periods the company recognized interest charges of less than 02 million in each of the fiscal years ended august 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements when applicable the company adjusts the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is ultimately settled the company regularly engages in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions it is reasonably possible that certain federal foreign and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months however factset has no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes andor penalties that would have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position beyond current estimates any changes in accounting estimates resulting from new developments with respect to uncertain tax positions will be recorded as appropriate the company does not currently anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next 12 months 

  

the following table summarizes the changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits

indemnifications 

  

as permitted or required under delaware law and to the maximum extent allowable under that law factset has certain obligations to indemnify its current and former officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at factset’s request in such capacity these indemnification obligations are valid as long as the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the company and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful the maximum potential amount of future payments factset could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited however factset has a director and officer insurance policy that it believes mitigates factsets exposure and may enable factset to recover a portion of any future amounts paid the company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is immaterial 

  

20 risks and concentrations of credit risk 

    

financial risk management 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect its operating results financial position and cash flows the company’s primary foreign currency market exposures include the british pound sterling euro japanese yen indian rupee and philippine peso to the extent that factset’s international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase factset manages its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk through its regular operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge currency exposures as well as to reduce earnings volatility resulting from shifts in market rates factset only enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposures the fair market values of all the company’s derivative contracts change with fluctuations in currency rates and are designed so that any changes in their values are offset by changes in the values of the underlying exposures see note 5 derivative instruments  for additional analysis of the company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

cash and cash equivalents  the fair market value of factset’s cash and investments at august 31 2016 was 2526 million the company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value the company’s investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and as such are classified as investments within the consolidated balance sheet it is anticipated that the fair market value of its cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of factset’s cash and investment policy pursuant to established investment guidelines the company tries to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification its investment guidelines do not permit factset to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because the company has a restrictive investment policy its financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low the company does not believe that the value or liquidity of its cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events 

  

debt  as of august 31 2016 the fair value of factset’s longterm debt was 3000 million which approximated its carrying amount and was determined based on quoted market prices for debt with a similar maturity it is anticipated that the fair market value of factset’s debt will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and it does not believe that the value of its debt has been significantly impacted by current market events the debt bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to 075 plus the eurodollar rate which is equal to onemonth libor during the years ended august 31 2016 and 2015 we recorded interest expense of 31 million and 01 million respectively on the outstanding loan amount assuming all terms of the company’s outstanding longterm debt remained the same a hypothetical 25 basis point change up or down in the onemonth libor rate would result in a 08 million change in its annual interest expense 

  

 

 

  

current market events have not required the company to modify materially or change its financial risk management strategies with respect to its exposures to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk 

    

  

concentrations of credit risk 

  

cash equivalents 

  

cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk the company seeks to mitigate its credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties

derivative instruments

data content providers 

  

certain data sets that factset relies on have a limited number of suppliers although the company makes every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available however factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier in order to meet the needs of its clients factset combines the data from these commercial databases into its own dedicated single online service which the client accesses to perform their analysis no single vendor or data supplier represented 10 or more of factsets total data expenses in any fiscal year presented

overall asv growth for our buyside business was 90 down 40 basis points from the prior year period while our sellside business experienced 76 growth down 180 basis points from the prior year period the decrease in the buy and sellside growth rates can be attributed to an increase in marketrelated cancellations

free cash flow for fiscal 2016 was 2834 million free cash flow generated during fiscal 2016 was attributable to 3388 million of net income including an aftertax gain on sale of 817 million 506 million of positive working capital changes and 583 million in noncash expenses less 477 million in capital expenditures free cash flow generated in the last twelve months was up 26 million from the comparable year ago period due to higher levels of net income and the timing of payables and accrued compensation offset by incremental capital expenditures 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 1584 million in fiscal 2016 representing a 935 million increase from fiscal 2015 this increase was primarily due to our acquisition of portware in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which resulted in a net cash outflow of 2629 million compared to a net cash outflow of 348 million for acquisitions occurring in fiscal 2015 additionally cash used in investing activities increased year over year due to an increase in capital expenditures  primarily due to the fitout of new space in new york chicago and the expansion of our corporate headquarters in norwalk these cash outflows were partially offset by net proceeds of 1531 million from the sale of our market metrics business and an increase in proceeds from the sales of investments net of purchases of 35 million year over year 

  

 

 

  

during fiscal 2016 net cash used in financing activities was 910 million compared to 1873 million in fiscal 2015 the year over year decrease in cash used was primarily due to proceeds from longterm debt of 2650 million  offset by an increase in cash used in share repurchases of 1006 million lower proceeds and tax benefits from stock options exercised of 254 million  and an increase in payments of regular quarterly dividends of 77 million the proceeds from longterm debt related to additional borrowings under the second amendment defined in capital needs  to our credit agreement dated february 6 2015 the “credit agreement” used to fund our acquisition of portware on october 16 2015 cash used in share repurchases increased year over year as we repurchased 15 million shares for 2323 million under the existing share repurchase program and 06 million shares for 1200 million related to the asr agreement entered into in july 2016 we repurchased 17 million shares for 2528 million in fiscal 2015 under the existing share repurchase program dividend payments increased as our board of directors approved a 136 increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 050 per share or 200 per share per annum  beginning with the dividend payment in june 2016 

  

we expect that for at least the next 12 months our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash as of august 31 2016 our total cash and cash equivalents worldwide was 2284 million  with 3000 million in outstanding borrowings approximately 288 million of our total available cash and cash equivalents is held in bank accounts located within the us 1619 million in europe predominantly within the uk and france and the remaining 377 million is held in the asia pacific region as of august 31 2016 we believe our liquidity including cash on hand cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate within each geographic segment will be sufficient to meet our shortterm and longterm operating requirements as they occur including working capital needs capital expenditures dividend payments stock repurchases growth objectives and other financing activities in addition we expect existing foreign cash cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities such as capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

  

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

  

cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 1589 million or 216 of our total assets at august 31 2015 compared with 1164 million or 175 of our total assets august 31 2014 our cash and cash equivalents increased 425 million during fiscal 2015 due to cash provided by operations of 3064 million 715 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 350 million in proceeds from longterm debt and 289 million in tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements these cash inflows were partially offset by 348 million in cash paid to acquire businesses 2528 million in share repurchases dividend payments of 666 million capital expenditures of 257 million and purchases of investments net of proceeds of 44 million 

  

free cash flow for fiscal 2015 was 2808 million exceeding net income by 16 free cash flow generated during fiscal 2015 was attributable to 2411 million of net income 376 million of positive working capital changes and 278 million in noncash expenses less 257 million in capital expenditures working capital improvements were derived from lower income tax payments and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses due to the timing of payments partially offset by a rise in accounts receivable compared to the prior year the rise in accounts receivable was due to our year over year revenue growth our accounts receivable balance as of august 31 2015  rose by only 52 compared with august 31 2014 while revenue growth grew by 94 year over year this lesser percentage increase was primarily due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding “dso” which declined to 33 days as of august 31 2015  compared to 34 days as of august 31 2014 

  

net cash used in investing activities was 649 million during fiscal 2015 a decrease of 58 million over fiscal 2014 due to a 121 million decrease in cash used in business acquisitions and a 17 million increase in proceeds from sales of shortterm investments net of purchases partially offset by a 79 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures 

  

net cash used in financing activities was 1873 million during fiscal 2015 of this total 2528 million related to the repurchase of 17 million shares under the existing share repurchase program and 666 million was for the payment of regular quarterly dividends partially offsetting these uses of cash were proceeds received from employee stock plans totaling 715 million related tax benefits of 289 million and longterm debt of 350 million net cash used in financing activities was 894 million lower in the current year due to a 363 million increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises and its related income tax benefits proceeds from longterm debt of 350 million and a decrease in share repurchases of 236 million these positive cash movements were partially offset by an incremental 55 million in dividend payments due to the 128 increase in our regular quarterly dividend beginning in may 2015 

  

capital resources 

  

capital expenditures 

  

capital expenditures were 477 million during fiscal 2016 up from 257 million a year ago approximately 277 million or 58 of our capital expenditures related to the build out of office space including 151 million at our new york location 39 million at our chicago location and 14 million at our corporate headquarters in norwalk the remainder of our capital expenditures was primarily for purchases of more servers for our existing data centers additional laptop computers and peripherals for new employees upgrades to existing computer systems and improvements to our telecommunication equipment 

  

 

 

  

capital expenditures were 257 million during fiscal 2015 up from 177 million in fiscal 2014 approximately 138 million or 54 of our capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 were for purchase of computer equipment including more servers for our existing data centers purchasing laptop computers and peripherals for employees upgrading existing computer systems and improving telecommunication equipment the remaining 46 of our capital expenditures were used to build out our offices primarily in new york texas and the philippines during fiscal 2015 

  

capital needs 

  

longterm debt 

  

on february 6 2015 we entered into a credit agreement between factset as the borrower and bank of america na as the lender the “lender” at that date the credit agreement provided for a 350 million revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” under which we could request borrowings the credit agreement also allowed us to arrange for additional borrowings for an aggregate amount of up to 2650 million  provided that any such request for additional borrowings was in a minimum amount of 250 million 

  

for purposes of funding our acquisition of code red on february 6 2015 we borrowed 350 million in the form of a eurodollar rate loan the “loan” under the revolving credit facility the proceeds of the loan made under the credit agreement could be used for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes on september 21 2015 we amended the credit agreement to borrow an additional 2650 million the “second amendment” in order to fund our acquisition of portware which closed on october 16 2015 the maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts which totaled 3000 million as of august 31 2016 is september 21 2018 the second amendment also allows us subject to certain requirements to arrange for additional borrowings with the lender for an aggregate amount of up to 4000 million provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of 250 million on october 26 2016 we borrowed an additional 650 million for general corporate purposes 

  

the 3000 million borrowed under the credit agreement bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate plus 075 and is reported as longterm debt within the consolidated balance sheet at august 31 2016 the eurodollar rate is defined in the credit agreement as the rate per annum equal to onemonth libor interest on the loan is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date during fiscal 2016 and 2015 we paid approximately 31 million and 01 million respectively in interest on our outstanding loan amount the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date 

  

as of august 31 2016 we owed no commitment fees since we borrowed the full amount of the credit agreement other fees incurred such as legal costs to draft and review the credit agreement totaled less than 01 million and were capitalized as loan origination fees these loan origination fees are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan three years using the effective interest method the credit agreement contains covenants restricting certain factset activities which are usual and customary for this type of loan 

  

in addition the credit agreement requires us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as measured by total funded debtebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the credit agreement as of august 31 2016 

  

as of august 31 2016 the fair value of our longterm debt was 3000 million which we believe approximates the carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis 

  

letters of credit 

  

from time to time we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business approximately 10 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with various current leased office spaces as of august 31 2016 these standby letters of credit contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios as of august 31 2016 and 2015 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit 

  

 

 

  

foreign currency 

  

foreign currency exposure 

  

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

as of august 31 2016 our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next 12 months were estimated to be 200 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses were estimated to be 2133 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 1933 million our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where 71 of our employees were located as of august 31 2016 during fiscal 2016 foreign currency movements decreased operating income by 116 million compared to 112 million a year ago 

  

foreign currency hedges 

  

as of august 31 2016 we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure 

  

   

   

as of august 31 2016 the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase british pound sterling with us dollars was £231 million the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was rs 42 billion 

  

there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31 2016 a loss on derivatives of 05 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2016 compared to a loss of 06 million in fiscal 2015 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

at august 31 2016 and 2015 we had no offbalance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating offbalance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes 

  

share repurchase program 

  

in fiscal 2016 we repurchased 15 million shares for 2323 million under the existing share repurchase program compared to 17 million shares for 2528 million under the existing share repurchase program during fiscal 2015 in july 2016 we entered into an asr agreement to repurchase 1200 million of our common stock we received 595607 shares of common stock on july 5 2016  which was approximately 80 of the total number of shares of common stock expected to be repurchased under the asr agreement the final settlement of the asr agreement occurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with factset receiving an additional 102916 shares of its common stock in conjunction with the asr agreement in may 2016 our board of directors approved a 1650 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program including the expansion 1970 million remained available for future share repurchases as of august 31 2016 

  

 

 

  

contractual obligations 

  

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2016 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

  

  

   

   

   

   

   

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreedupon amounts for any of our obligations 

  

as disclosed earlier in the capital resources section of this mda we borrowed 350 million in the form of a eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of code red in february 2015  and 2650 million in the form of a eurodollar rate loan to fund the acquisition of portware in october 2015 the maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts is september 21 2018  and there are no prepayment penalties in the event that we elect to prepay the loan prior to its scheduled maturity date the amount borrowed bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate plus 075 and is reported as longterm debt within our consolidated balance sheet at august 31 2016 

  

dividends 

  

on may 6 2016 our board of directors approved a 136 increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the dividend payment in june 2016 which was 050 per share or 200 per share per annum with our dividends and our share repurchases in the aggregate we have returned 4310 million to shareholders over the past 12 months future cash dividends will depend on our earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our board of directors 

  

during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 our board of directors declared the following dividends 

  

   

all of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources future cash dividends will depend on our earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors we considered relevant and is subject to final determination by our board of directors 

  

significant accounting policies 

  

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

 

 

  

business combinations 

  

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms our significant assumptions and estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

  

performancebased equity awards 

  

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which allows for the issuance of performancebased equity awards to employees accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performancebased equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest at the end of each reporting period management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels however there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part 

  

july 2012 performancebased option grant review 

  

in july 2012 we granted 241546 performancebased employee stock options which are eligible to vest in 20 tranches depending upon future streetaccount user growth through august 31 2017 through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 four of the growth targets as outlined within the terms of the grant were achieved as such 80 or 193256 of the options granted have vested as of august 31 2016 the fifth tranche is expected to vest on august 31 2017 resulting in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 03 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 10 year a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by streetaccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense 

  

  

   

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2016 

  

february 2015 performancebased option grant review 

  

in connection with the acquisition of code red during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we granted 137522 performancebased stock options these performancebased options are eligible to vest four years from date of grant if certain code red asv and operating margin targets are achieved over the measurement period the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest 

  

 

 

  

of the total grant 68761 performancebased options are eligible for vesting based on achieving the growth targets over a two year measurement period ending february 28 2017 as of august 31 2016 total unamortized stockbased compensation of 13 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 24 years a change up or down in the actual financial performance levels achieved by code red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense 

  

   

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2016 

  

the remaining 68761 options are eligible to cliff vest based on a fouryear measurement period ending february 28 2019 as of august 31 2016 total unamortized stockbased compensation of 07 million will be recognized as expense over the remaining vesting period of 24 years a change up or down in the actual financial performance levels achieved by code red in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense 

  

   

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2016 

  

october 2015 and august 2016 performancebased option grant review 

  

in connection with the acquisition of portware during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we granted 530418 performancebased stock options these performancebased options will vest 40 on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20 on each subsequent anniversary date if certain portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by october 16 2017 the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest as of august 31 2016 we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved and as such no stockbased compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performancebased options a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense 

  

   

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2016 

  

we granted 20911 additional performancebased stock options to portware employees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 similar to the october 2015 grant these performancebased options will vest 40 on the second anniversary date of the grant and 20 on each subsequent anniversary date if certain portware revenue and operating income targets are achieved by october 16 2017 the option holders must also remain employed by factset for the options to be eligible to vest as of august 31 2016 we do not believe these growth targets are probable of being achieved and as such no stockbased compensation expense is expected to be recognized in connection with these performancebased options a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by portware in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense 

  

   

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2016 

  

 

 

  

accrued compensation 

  

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 15 of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates on a quarterly basis and adjusts accrual rates as appropriate as of august 31 2016 and 2015 the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation was 382 million and 386 million respectively 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

goodwill is not amortized as it is estimated to have an indefinite life at least annually we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for potential impairment and if impaired write down to fair value based on the present value of discounted cash flows our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the us europe and asia pacific which reflect the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations the three reporting units are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with these reporting units including assigning assets liabilities goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 

  

our impairment analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry and economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of our business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategies taking into consideration present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations we have not made any material changes in our impairment analysis methodology during the past three fiscal years while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset 

  

we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 consistent with previous years at which time it was determined that there were no indications of impairment with the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2016 and 2015  was 4529 million and 3083 million respectively 

  

our identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired content databases client relationships software technology noncompete agreements and trade names resulting from acquisitions which have been fully integrated into our operations depending on the nature of the intangible asset it is amortized on either a straightline or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging from two to twenty years these useful lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31 2016 and 2015 

  

intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31 2016 and 2015  was 932 million and 401 million respectively 

  

longlived assets 

  

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment if impairment indicators are present we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described here there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2016 and 2015  was 846 million and 593 million respectively 

  

 

 

  

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

  

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and domestic production activities deductions our annual effective tax rate was 265 278 and 303 in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements 

  

as of august 31 2016 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 88 million including 13 million of accrued interest recorded as taxes payable noncurrent within the consolidated balance sheet unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements when applicable we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled if recognized the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statements of income audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes for this reason we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

  

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition

market trends 

  

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving the volatility of equity markets as well as foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations 

  

approximately 826 of our asv is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment management clients our investment banking clients that perform ma advisory work provide capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 174 of our asv a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by the largest banks credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in ma funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments 

  

due to the global nature of our operations we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee japanese yen and philippine peso to the extent that our international activities increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage this exposure we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposure to the counterparties associated with these instruments our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency 

  

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted including a sharp decline in the value of the british pound sterling as compared to the us dollar volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu we currently hedge approximately 50 of our british pound sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 thus reducing our currency risk in the longer term any impact from brexit on us will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results while we evaluate our own risks and uncertainty related to brexit we will continue to partner with our clients to help them navigate the fluctuating international markets our products including our datasets such as georev allow our clients to understand geographic exposure and assess the risks of operating on a global scale so they may make informed business decisions

first quarter fiscal 2017 expectations 

  

   

   

   

   

dividend payment 

  

on august 5 2016 we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 050 per share the cash dividend of 200 million was paid on september 20 2016 to common stockholders of record on august 31 2016 using our existing cash generated by operations 

  

 

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro indian rupee japanese yen and philippine peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses over the next 12 months our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized are estimated to be 200 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 2133 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 1933 million per year to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency 

  

as of august 31 2016 we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure 

  

   

   

as of august 31 2016 the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase british pound sterling with us dollars was £231 million the gross notional value of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was rs 42 billion 

  

there were no other outstanding foreign currency forward contracts as of august 31 2016 a loss on derivatives of 05 million was recorded into operating income in fiscal 2016 compared to a loss of 06 million a year ago the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings the related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 

  

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2016 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 71 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base had we not had any hedges in place as of august 31 2016 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2016 would result in a decrease in operating income by 182 million over the next 12 months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2016 would increase the fair value of total assets by 295 million and equity by 266 million 

  

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which british citizens approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum the global markets and currencies have been adversely impacted including a sharp decline in the value of the british pound sterling as compared to the us dollar volatility in exchange rates is expected to continue in the short term as the uk negotiates its exit from the eu we hedge approximately 50 of our british pound sterling exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 thus reducing our currency risk in the longer term any impact from brexit on us will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations although it is unknown what the result of those negotiations will be it is possible that new terms may adversely affect our operations and financial results 

  

 

 

  

interest rate risk 

  

cash and cash equivalents   

  

the fair market value of our cash and investments at august 31 2016  was 2526 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value our investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and as such are classified as investments within our consolidated balance sheet it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events 

  

debt 

  

as of august 31 2016 the fair value of our longterm debt was 3000 million which approximated its carrying amount and was determined based on quoted market prices for debt with a similar maturity it is anticipated that the fair market value of our debt will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and we do not believe that the value of our debt has been significantly impacted by current market events the debt bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to 075 plus the eurodollar rate which is equal to onemonth libor during fiscal 2016 we paid 31 million in interest on our outstanding loan amount compared to 01 million in the prior year assuming all terms of our outstanding longterm debt remained the same a hypothetical 25 basis point change up or down in the onemonth libor rate would result in a 08 million change in our annual interest expense

third party data content 

factset aggregates third party content from more than 220 data suppliers 100 news sources and 80 exchanges into its own dedicated online service which the client accesses to perform their analyses factset carries content from premier providers such as thomson reuters standard  poor’s axioma inc interactive data corporation llc dow jones  company inc northfield information services inc barclays capital intex solutions inc bureau van dijk proquote limited msci barra six financial information usa inc morningstar inc russell investments bank of america merrill lynch nyse euronext london stock exchange tokyo stock exchange nasdaq omx australian securities exchange and toyo keizai content fees billed to the company may be on a fixed or royalty per client basis 

  

factset seeks to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each major type of financial data though certain data sets on which factset relies have a limited number of suppliers the company makes every effort when reasonable to locate alternative sources to ensure that factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier the company has entered into third party content agreements with varying lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice no single vendor or data supplier represented more than 10 of factsets total data expenses in any fiscal year presented 

  

data centers 

factset’s business is dependent on its ability to process substantial volumes of data and transactions rapidly and efficiently on its networks and systems  the company’s global technology infrastructure supports its operations and is designed to facilitate the reliable and efficient processing and delivery of data and analytics to its clients factset’s data centers contain multiple layers of redundancy to enhance system performance including maintaining processing and storing data at multiple data centers user connections are load balanced between data centers in the event of a site failure equipment problem or localized disaster the remaining center has the capacity to handle the additional load factset continues to be focused on maintaining a global technological infrastructure that allows the company to support its growing business 

  

factset launched its multiphase project project nextgen a few years ago to evolve away from large mainframe computers to a more distributed environment powered by a vast array of smaller faster and more costeffective machines the company operates fully redundant data centers in virginia and new jersey these data centers handle factset’s entire client capacity in addition factset maintains a vast private wide area network that provides a highspeed direct link between the client’s local network and the data content and powerful applications found on the company’s mainframe machines 

  

research and product developmen t costs 

a key aspect of the company’s growth strategy is to enhance its existing products and applications by making them faster and the data within them more reliable factset strives to rapidly adopt new technology that can improve its products and services research and product development costs relate to the salary and benefits for the company’s product development software engineering and technical support staff and as such these costs are expensed when incurred within cost of services as employee compensation the company expects to allocate a similar percentage of its workforce in future years in order to continue to develop new products and enhancements respond quickly to market changes and to meet the needs of its clients efficiently 

  

competition 

factset is part of the financial information services industry which provides accurate financial information and software solutions to the global investment community according to industry reports global spend on market data and analysis grew 41 to 265 billion in 2015 compared to the prior year this extremely competitive market is comprised of both large wellcapitalized companies and smaller niche firms including market data suppliers news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply the company with financial information included in the factset workstation the largest competitors to factset are bloomberg lp thomson reuters inc and standard  poor’s capital iq bloomberg’s market share grew to 320 up from 317 a year ago while thomson reuters’ was approximately 259 down slightly from the prior year standard  poor’s capital iq market share is believed to be between 3 and 5 comparable to that of factset other competitors and competitive products include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications such as msci inc morningstar inc markit ltd sungard dealogic plc interactive data corporation dow jones  company inc blackrock solutions the yield book inc rimes technologies corporation and wilshire associates inc  many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those sold by the company factset’s development of its own robust sets of proprietary content combined with its news and quotes offering have resulted in more direct competition with the largest financial data providers 

  

 

 

    

despite competing products and services factset enjoys high barriers to entry and believes it would be difficult for another vendor to replicate quickly the extensive databases the company currently offers through its indepth analytics and superior client service factset believes it can offer clients a more complete solution with one of the broadest sets of functionalities through a desktop user interface or data feed in addition factsets applications including its client support and service offerings are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysisscreening capabilities they offer as a result the companys products have become central to investment analysis and decisionmaking for clients

additional information 

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

   

 

 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 

  

risk factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset’s forwardlooking statements made by or on the company’s behalf include without limitation 

  

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

  

many of factset’s products as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of company security measures could expose factset its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company brand and reputation 

  

factset must continue to introduce new products and enhancements to maintain its technological position 

  

the market for factset is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards which can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis and they may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements 

  

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

  

the company’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for talent including engineering personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships factset’s failure to attract and retain talented employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

  

a decline in equity returns andor fixed income may impact the buying power of investment management clients 

  

approximately 825 of the company’s annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

  

u ncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause factset to lose clients and users 

  

factset’s sellside clients that perform ma advisory work capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 175 of its revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks while improvements have been observed in the current fiscal year the global investment banking industry continues to experience uncertainty and consolidation which directly impacts the number of prospective clients and users within the sector a lack of available credit would impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect the company’s financial results and future growth 

  

 

 

    

volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth 

  

sales cycles for factset may fluctuate and be extended in times where the financial markets are volatile the decision to purchase the factset service often requires managementlevel sponsorship which often leads factset to engage in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed as uncertainties in the financial markets may cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments the cycle associated with the purchase of the company’s service offerings typically depends upon the size of the client 

  

competition in factset’s industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

  

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products with competitors ranging in size from smaller highly specialized singleproduct businesses to multibillion dollar companies while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors may offer price incentives to attract new business competitive pricing pressures did not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations during fiscal 2015 or in any other fiscal year presented however future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions may also result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services in recent years factset has seen clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors by selecting vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for factset 

  

each year more and more free or relatively inexpensive information becomes available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for factset while the company believes its service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other added value factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources factset’s business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows 

  

the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates as 70 of factset’s employees and 48 of its leased office space are located outside the us these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial results and cash flows the company’s primary exposures relate to expenses denominated in british pound sterling euros japanese yen indian rupee and philippine peso this exposure has increased over the past 12 months primarily as the company’s international employee base has risen 12 since august 31 2014 and represented 70 of the factset workforce at august 31 2015 factset’s nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 307 million while its nonus dollar denominated expenses are estimated to be 2054 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 1747 million although factset believes that its foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances the company’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on its results of operations 

  

a prolonged or recurring outage at factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

  

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations however a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers and any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective   

  

 

 

  

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing data sets or products 

  

factset is a provider of global financial and economic information on companies worldwide aggregating third party content from more than 220 data suppliers 100 news sources and 80 exchanges clients have access to the data and content found within the factset databases which they can combine and utilize in nearly all of the company’s applications these databases are important to the company’s operations as they provide clients with key information such as company fundamentals estimates global equity ownership ma data events and transcripts earnings and other equity and fixed income data factset has entered into third party content agreements with varying lengths which in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice 

  

factset seeks to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each major type of financial data though certain data sets on which factset relies have a limited number of suppliers the company makes every effort when reasonable to locate alternative sources to ensure factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier these data sets include without limitation 1 equity pricing from exchanges such as nasdaq 2 global exchange indices 3 sp cusip distribution 4 sp ratings and 5 moody’s investor service corporate ratings factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier and no single vendor or data supplier represented more than 10 of factsets total data expenses in any fiscal year presented the company combines data from commercial databases into its own dedicated single online service which the client accesses to perform their analysis the failure of factset to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights   

  

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms enter into settlements stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients or vendors under contractual provisions of various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue incurring expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

  

changes in securities laws and regulations may increase expenses or may harm demand 

  

many of factset’s clients operate within a highly regulated environment in light of the recent conditions in the us financial markets and economy the us congress and federal regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry the information provided by or resident in the service factset provides to its clients could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving its clients which could result in requests for information from factset that could be expensive and time consuming in addition clients subject to investigations or legal proceedings may be adversely impacted possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reductions in assets under management or diminished operations that would adversely affect the company’s revenues 

  

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset’s operating results 

  

factset is party to lawsuits in the normal course of business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings  contained in part i of this report 

  

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

  

factset is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes tax liability or effective tax rates in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before income taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations including its provision for income taxes

results of operations   

  

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report on form 10k 

 

   

revenues 

  

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

revenues in fiscal 2015 were 10068 million up 94 compared to fiscal 2014 our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2015 were increases in asv clients and users accelerated demand for our fixed income portfolio products portfolio analytics “pa” suite of products sales of equity attribution and multi asset class risk models additional purchases of our portfolio services solutions expansion of our proprietary content and continued growth of our rms offering 

  

annual subscription value 

  

as of august 31 2015 asv was 1058 billion up 92 organically from a year ago asv at a given point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscription services being supplied to our clients with proper notice to us our clients are able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time subject to certain contractual limitations 

  

   

  

we believe that our organic asv growth of 92 in fiscal 2015 and 73 in fiscal 2014 highlight the strength of our subscription business model we continue to focus on expanding the business by providing superior analytical applications premier global content and unmatched client service the 92 increase in organic asv during fiscal 2015 relates to broadbased global growth from both the buy and sellside we have seen accelerated demand for our fixed income portfolio products pa suite of products sales of equity attribution and multi asset class risk models our stable of valueadded products in the equity and fixed income analytics suite provided the company with strong sales in our european and asia pacific segments organic asv growth of 92 excludes 10 million of asv from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2015 and a 39 million detriment from foreign currency 

  

 

 

    

asv from our us operations was 7148 million up 87 organically from a year ago international asv totaled 3431 million as of august 31 2015 up 102 organically from a year ago and represented 324 of our companywide total organic asv growth rates from buy and sellside clients rose to 90 and 98 respectively the percentage of our total asv derived from buyside clients decreased slightly from 826 a year ago to 825 at august 31 2015 

  

growth in the number of users and clients of factset 

  

during fiscal 2015 we added 183 net new clients which excludes 50 new clients acquired from the acquisition of code red in february 2015 increasing the number of clients by 67 over the prior year including the 50 new clients from code red our total client count was 2976 as of august 31 2015 the addition of new clients is important to us as we anticipate that it lays the groundwork to provide additional services in the future consistent with our strategy of increasing sales of workstations applications and content at our existing clients annual client retention as of august 31 2015 was greater than 95 of asv and 94 when expressed as a percentage of clients an increase from 93 as of the end of fiscal 2014 we believe these statistics underscore the power of our business model as the large majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to factset throughout each year at august 31 2015 our largest individual client accounted for 2 of total subscriptions and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15 of total client subscriptions consistent with the prior year 

  

at august 31 2015 there were 62205 professionals using factset an increase of 7609 users from a year ago during the last twelve months our investment management clients added 4203 net new users while our investment banking clients added 3406 net new users our user count within the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 alone increased by 3210 users compared to 2113 in the year ago fourth quarter marking it our largest ever quarterly increase significant additions came from both our investment management and banking clients the fourth quarter typically includes new users from both the buy and sellside as our larger clients bring in new hire classes and this quarter we saw sizable new hire classes at our banking clients growth during 2015 in both the ipo and ma markets has also helped improve business for our banking clients in addition during the just completed fiscal year we released a new user interface that emphasizes ease of use and search which we believe contributed to our net user increase in fiscal 2015 

  

growth within portfolio analytics 

  

our pa suite of products including our fixed income in pa product continues to be well received within our client base and was a source of revenue growth during fiscal 2015 our clients have recognized the value of these applications and their capabilities in analyzing securities and portfolios the pa suite includes separate products and covers a range of workflows around portfolios the number of clients and users subscribing to pa fixed income in pa style performance and risk “spar” risk and portfolio publishing continued to grow as this suite is comprehensive and includes highly desired applications for portfolio attribution risk quantitative analysis portfolio publishing and returns based style analysis clients continue to find value in our ability to serve as a single solution for their analytics risk and publishing needs over a variety of asset classes which enables them to analyze securities and portfolios based on a variety of asset classes 

  

increased demand for portfolio services solutions 

  

our solutions in the portfolio services space continued to do well our services offer turnkey integration robust and transparent reconciliation and standardized and custom reporting options our team of specialists monitors and remedies issues as they occur during all stages of the client’s workflow from data extraction to analytical enrichment through report generation and data delivery as clients look for areas to outsource services around data integration enrichment quality control and process monitoring they are turning more and more to our managed services in this space 

  

expansion of our proprietary content 

  

our proprietary content also continues to be a strong product line for us as well as a growing opportunity for us to expand our data feed business we continue to be successful in licensing proprietary factset data especially factset fundamentals and factset estimates as our global content sales team pursues expanding the distribution of our content this type of data is licensed in feed form and includes asreported financials etf data  analytics enterprise data governance callstreet and ownership data feeds are consumed by a wide range of clients including existing large factset clients and some outside of our core client base that do not manage money or provide sellside services in addition streetaccount our condensed news product sells strongly across all factset user types and continues to be in demand due to the ability of our clients to receive uptotheminute news offered both through and outside the factset workstation 

  

 

 

    

research management solutions rms 

  

on february 6 2015 we acquired code red whose primary line of business is to provide research management technologies to the investment community including endowments and foundations institutional asset managers sovereign wealth funds pensions and hedge funds with the addition of code red to factsets existing research management solution we now offer an rms for all our clients workflows at the time of acquisition code red had annual subscriptions of 93 million for fiscal 2015 the acquisition of code red added incremental revenue of 52 million together with our internal research notes product our rms solutions continued to grow particularly in the fourth quarter as clients now have a choice between our hosted and local solutions 

  

effects of foreign currency 

  

the positive revenue drivers disclosed above were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency including a weaker japanese yen british pound sterling and euro foreign currency movements reduced revenues by 34 million during fiscal 2015 compared to a reduction of 12 million in fiscal 2014 

  

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

revenues in fiscal 2014 were 9203 million up 73 compared to fiscal 2013 revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2014 were the addition of 200 new clients and 3628 users  a 73 increase in organic asv continued growth in our portfolio analytics suite of products rising sales of our wealth management workflow solution expansion of proprietary content stabilization within sellside client base and incremental revenues from the acquisitions of revere and matrix organic asv growth of 73 excludes 12 million of asv acquired from revere and matrix during fiscal 2014 and a 08 million detriment from foreign currency

revenues from our us segment increased 87 to 6788 million in fiscal 2015 compared to 6246 million a year ago our fiscal 2015 us revenue growth rate of 87 reflects increases in the number of users and clients of factset within the us a rise in sales of our pa suite of products continued demand for our proprietary content 52 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of code red and a strong performance by our us investment management sales team our us buyside sales team has seen sustained demand for our fixed income portfolio products multiasset class risk and stress testing attribution and publishing products revenues from our us operations accounted for 674 of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2015 down from 679 a year ago as our international asv growth rate surpassed our us asv growth rate by 150 basis points

european revenues advanced 106 year over year which was attributable to increases in client and user counts continued growth in asv from european sellside clients and robust sales of pa subscriptions partially offset by the negative effects of foreign currency foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our european growth rate by 40 basis points the asia pacific revenue growth rate of 120 was primarily due to net new user and client growth increased pa subscriptions and our proficiency in selling additional services to existing clients partially offset by negative foreign currency impact attributable to the change in the value of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our asia pacific growth rate by 350 basis points 

  

 

 

    

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013

operating expenses 

  

   

   

   

cost of services 

  

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

cost of services increased 146 to 4053 million as compared to the same period a year ago expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of services was 403 in fiscal 2015 an increase of 190 basis points from a year ago the increase was driven by higher employee compensation including stockbased compensation partially offset by lower computer depreciation 

  

employee compensation including stockbased compensation when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 210 basis points during fiscal 2015 due to new classes of consultants engineers and product developers hired in the past 12 months new additions at our proprietary content collection locations the addition of 32 employees from the code red acquisition an increase in variable compensation and annual base salary increases over the last 12 months we have added 344 net new employees involved with content collection 252 net new engineering and product development employees and 124 net new consultants as we continue to focus on servicing our existing client base expanding our content and improving our applications in addition of the total incremental 62 million expense recorded in fiscal 2015 from the vesting of performancebased equity instruments and changes in the senior leadership responsible for the company’s salesforce 24 million was reported within cost of services expenses associated with the operation of the code red business increased cost of services by 35 million during fiscal 2015 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce including stockbased compensation from equity based awards granted amortization of acquired intangible assets and computerrelated expenses 

  

partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2015 was a reduction in computer depreciation expense which decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2015 compared to a year ago this decrease was primarily due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and costeffective servers in our data centers 

  

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

cost of services increased 154 to 3537 million in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of services was 384 in fiscal 2014 an increase of 270 basis points from fiscal 2013 the increase was driven by higher employee compensation additional third party data costs and incremental costs from the revere and matrix acquisitions partially offset by lower computerrelated expenses including depreciation 

  

employee compensation including stockbased compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 300 basis points during fiscal 2014 excluding compensation attributable to the acquired revere and matrix workforces the increase in employee compensation was 250 basis points largely due to increased employee headcount and annual employee base salary increases in fiscal 2014 we hired 202 net new software engineers and 70 net new consultants dedicated to the development enhancement and support of our products third party data costs when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points during fiscal 2014 many of our data contracts are driven by our user and client count so as we continue to grow in these metrics so do our datarelated costs user count rose by 7 while clients grew 10 in fiscal 2014 thus driving up our third party data costs expenses associated with the operations of revere and matrix increased the cost of services when expressed as a percentage of revenues by 80 basis points during fiscal 2014 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce stockbased compensation from equitybased awards granted incremental third party data costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets 

  

 

 

  

partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2014 was a reduction in computerrelated expenses computerrelated expenses including computer depreciation and maintenance costs decreased 30 basis points in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and costeffective servers in our data centers

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

sga expenses increased 19 to 2695 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to 2644 million in fiscal 2014 expressed as a percentage of revenues sga expenses decreased 190 basis points to 268 in fiscal 2015 due to lower employee compensation and lower occupancy costs which include rent and depreciation of furniture and fixtures 

  

employee compensation including stockbased compensation when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 130 basis points due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus sga of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2015 84 was within our software engineering content collection and product development teams which are all included within cost of services as such sga employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services occupancy costs when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 60 basis points primarily due to furniture and leasehold improvements becoming fully depreciated lower rent expense from the strengthening of the us dollar and the timing of acquiring new real estate space however certain occupancy costs such as rent are temporary and are being driven by the timing of acquiring new space to support our growing employee population 

  

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

sga expenses decreased 63 to 2644 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to 2823 million in 2013 expressed as a percentage of revenues sga expenses decreased 420 basis points to 287 for fiscal 2014 due to lower employee compensation including stockbased compensation partially offset by higher employee travel and entertainment “te” expenses 

  

employee compensation when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 440 basis points from fiscal 2013 due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus sga and a prior year stockbased compensation charge of 164 million from the vesting of market metrics and streetaccount performancebased options of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2014 79 derived from our software engineering content collection and product development teams which are all included within cost of services as such sga employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services   

  

partially offsetting the overall decrease in sga expenses was higher te expense which rose by 20 basis points when expressed as a percentage of revenues the primary drivers for this increase were more client visits by our salesforce higher plane and hotel prices and increased interoffice travel due to our expanding worldwide presence 

  

operating income and operating margin

operating income increased 98 to 3319 million in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year our operating margin for fiscal 2015 was 330 up from 328 a year ago operating margin in fiscal 2015 was negatively impacted by a 32 million pretax charge related to changes in the senior leadership of our sales teams and a 30 million pretax charge primarily related to the vesting of performancebased equity instruments operating income in fiscal 2014 included 30 million of pretax charges related to vesting of performancebased equity instruments and the settlement of a legal claim excluding these charges our fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin was 336 compared to the fiscal 2014 adjusted operating margin of 332 revenue growth of 94 and net foreign currency benefits totaling of 112 million aided our current year operating margin expansion

operating income by segment 

  

   

our operating segments are aligned with how we manage the business and the demographic markets in which we serve our internal financial reporting structure is based on three reportable segments us europe and asia pacific which we believe helps us better manage the business and view the markets we serve sales consulting data collection product development and software engineering are the primary functional groups within each segment each segment records compensation expense including stockbased compensation amortization of intangible assets depreciation of furniture and fixtures amortization of leasehold improvements communication costs professional fees rent expense travel marketing office and other direct expenses expenditures associated with our data centers third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the us segment and are not allocated to the other segments the content collection centers located in india and the philippines benefit all of our segments and thus the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues

operating income from our us business advanced 48 to 1730 million during fiscal 2015 compared to 1650 million a year ago the increase in operating income is primarily attributable to 541 million of incremental revenues and a decrease in computer depreciation partially offset by a rise in employee compensation expense us revenue growth was driven by increases in the number of users and clients of factset within the us a rise in sales of our pa suite of products continued demand for our proprietary content 52 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of code red and a strong performance by our us investment management sales team excluding the acquired code red workforce us employee headcount increased 70 over the prior year leading to higher employee compensation costs during fiscal 2015 computerrelated expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and costeffective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers 

  

european operating income increased 152 during fiscal 2015 to 1163 million due to revenue growth of 106 and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base partially offset by increases in employee compensation thirdparty data costs and occupancy expenses the higher employee compensation costs were due to a 175 increase in headcount over the prior year the increase in occupancy costs which includes rent expense was due to an increase in leased space in london finally the increased thirdparty data costs were due to the increased number of users year over year as many of our data contracts are driven by our user and client count 

  

asia pacific operating income increased 175 to 426 million compared to 363 million a year ago the increase was due to incremental revenues of 82 million and the effects of favorable foreign currency fluctuations on our expense base partially offset by higher employee compensation the higher employee compensation costs were due an 110 increase in headcount from the prior year

income taxes 

  

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

the fiscal 2015 provision for income taxes was 927 million up from 919 million a year ago the 09 increase was due to a 100 increase in pretax income offset by the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit in december 2014 the reenactment of the credit was retroactive to january 1 2014 and extended through the end of the 2014 calendar year prior to the reenactment of the tax credit we had not been permitted to factor it into our effective tax rate because it was not enacted tax law the reenactment resulted in a discrete income tax benefit of 51 million during fiscal 2015 additionally we recognized tax benefits of 37 million related to finalizing prior year tax returns and other discrete tax items 

  

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

the fiscal 2014 provision for income taxes was 919 million up 196 million or 272 from 723 million in fiscal 2013 this increase was due to a 120 increase in pretax income and the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit on december 31 2013 which limited our ability to realize income tax benefits from the rd tax credit to only four out of twelve months during fiscal 2014

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

net income increased 65 to 2115 million and diluted earnings per share increased 106 to 492 during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 drivers of the increase included a 73 rise in revenues lower stockbased compensation as a result of the fiscal 2013 aftertax charge of 129 million and a 37 decrease in diluted shares outstanding from share repurchases these increases were partially offset by a higher annual effective tax rate from the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit incremental employee compensation within cost of services due to the hiring of 202 net new software engineers and 70 net new consultants a rise in third party data costs from additional users and clients added and higher employee te

net cash used in investing activities was 649 million during fiscal 2015 a decrease of 58 million over the prior year due to a 121 million decrease in cash used in business acquisitions and a 17 million increase in proceeds from sales of shortterm investments net of purchases partially offset by a 79 million increase in cash used for capital expenditures

we expect that for at least the next 12 months our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash additionally to fund our acquisition of portware llc “portware” announced on september 22 2015 and closed on october 16 2015 we entered into an amendment the “second amendment” dated as of september 21 2015 amending and expanding the existing credit agreement dated february 6 2015 and borrowed an additional 2650 million on october 16 2015 the maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts is september 21 2018 for more information on the portware acquisition see note 21 subsequent events in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8

capital needs 

  

longterm debt 

on february 6 2015 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” between factset as the borrower and bank of america na as the lender the “lender” at that date the credit agreement provided for a 350 million revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” under which we could request borrowings until its maturity date of february 6 2018 the credit agreement also allowed us to arrange for additional borrowings for an aggregate amount of up to 2650 million provided that any such request for additional borrowings was in a minimum amount of 250 million 

  

 

 

    

for purposes of funding our acquisition of code red on february 6 2015 we borrowed 350 million in the form of a eurodollar rate loan the “loan” under the revolving credit facility the proceeds of the loan made under the credit agreement could be used for permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes there are no prepayment penalties if we elect to prepay the loan prior to its scheduled maturity date the principal balance is payable in full on the maturity date the 350 million we borrowed under the loan bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to the eurodollar rate plus 050 and is reported as longterm debt within our consolidated balance sheet at august 31 2015 the eurodollar rate is defined in the credit agreement as the rate per annum equal to onemonth libor interest on the loan is payable quarterly in arrears and on the maturity date during fiscal 2015 we paid approximately 01 million in interest on our outstanding loan amount 

  

on september 21 2015 we amended the credit agreement to borrow an additional 2650 million the “second amendment” in order to fund our acquisition of portware which was announced on september 22 2015 and closed on october 16 2015 the maturity date on all outstanding loan amounts which total 3000 million as of october 30 2015 is september 21 2018 the second amendment also allows factset subject to certain requirements to arrange for additional borrowings with the lender for an aggregate amount of up to 4000 million provided that any such request for additional borrowings must be in a minimum amount of 250 million 

  

as of august 31 2015 we owed no commitment fees since we borrowed the thenfull amount of the revolving credit facility on february 6 2015 other fees incurred such as legal costs to draft and review the credit agreement totaled less than 01 million and were capitalized as loan origination fees these loan origination fees are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan using the effective interest method and totaled less than  01 million in fiscal 2015 

  

the credit agreement contains covenants restricting certain factset activities which are usual and customary for this type of loan in addition the credit agreement requires that we maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as measured by total funded debtebitda below a specified level as of the end of each fiscal quarter we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the credit agreement as of august 31 2015 

  

as of august 31 2015 the fair value of our longterm debt was 350 million which we believe approximates carrying amount as the terms and interest rates approximate market rates given its floating interest rate basis 

  

letters of credit 

from time to time we are required to obtain letters of credit in the ordinary course of business approximately 10 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with our current leased office space as of august 31 2015 these standby letters of credit contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios as of august 31 2015 and 2014 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit

foreign currency exposure 

  

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity 

  

our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 307 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are estimated to be 2054 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 1747 million our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where approximately 70 of our employees are located as of august 31 2015 during fiscal 2015 foreign currency movements increased operating income by 112 million as compared to a 17 million decrease to operating income during fiscal 2014

at august 31 2015 and 2014 we had no offbalance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating offbalance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes 

  

share repurchase program

during fiscal 2015 we repurchased 17 million shares for 2528 million under the existing share repurchase program as compared to 25 million shares for 2754 million during fiscal 2014 including the expansion 1342 million remains authorized for future share repurchases as of august 31 2015 

  

contractual obligations 

  

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2015 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 

 

  

   

   

   

   

   

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and the timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreedupon amounts for any of our obligations

significant accounting policies 

  

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

business combinations 

  

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms our significant assumptions and estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

  

 

 

  

performancebased equity awards 

  

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which allows for the issuance of performancebased equity awards to employees accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performancebased equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest at the end of each reporting period management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels however there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part 

  

july 2012 performancebased option grant review 

in july 2012 we granted 241546 performancebased employee stock options which are eligible to vest in 20 tranches depending upon future streetaccount user growth through august 31 2017 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the first growth target as outlined within the terms of the grant was achieved thus 20 or 48314 options vested on august 31 2013 the second 20 tranche vested on august 31 2014 as a result of accelerated expansion of street account users during fiscal 2014 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the third growth target was achieved thus the third 20 tranche vested on august 31 2015 as of august 31 2015 we estimate that the fourth 20 tranche will vest by august 31 2017 resulting in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 06 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 20 years a change up or down in the actual financial performance levels achieved by streetaccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2015 and 2014 was 593 million and 576 million respectively 

  

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators occur the impairment test requires management to make judgments in connection with identifying reporting units assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units assigning goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit factset has three reporting units which are consistent with the operating segments reported as there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment the reporting units evaluated for potential impairment were the us europe and asia pacific which reflects the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations 

  

we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information goodwill is tested for impairment based on the present value of discounted cash flows and if impaired written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset 

  

 

 

  

we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 consistent with previous years at which time it was determined that there were no indications of impairment with the fair value of each of the company’s reporting units significantly exceeding carrying value the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2015 and 2014 was 3083 million and 2856 million respectively 

  

intangible assets consist of certain acquired content databases client relationships software technology noncompete agreements and trade names resulting from previous acquisitions and depending on the nature of the intangible asset are amortized on either a straightline or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and twenty years the remaining useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31 2015 and 2014 intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31 2015 and 2014 was 401 million and 419 million respectively our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and domestic production activities deductions our annual effective tax rate was 278 303 and 267 in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements 

  

as of august 31 2015 we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 68 million including 13 million of accrued interest recorded as noncurrent taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements when applicable we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled if recognized the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes for this reason we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

  

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

  

 

 

    

new accounting pronouncements 

  

see note 3 summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the company’s consolidated financial statements included in item 8 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption which we include here by reference 

  

management changes 

  

our chairman and ceo philip hadley stepped down as ceo effective july 1 2015 he remains an employee of factset and continues to serve as our chairman of the board of directors mr hadley age 53 has served as our ceo since september 2000 our president 19year factset veteran philip snow was named ceo effective july 1 2015 mr snow age 51 was also elected to our board of directors effective march 16 2015 

  

in addition on january 21 2015 we hired scott miller as our new executive vice president global director of sales mr miller succeeded michael frankenfield and reports directly to mr snow mr frankenfield who has been with factset since 1989 and had been in his current role since 2009 remains with us as a vice chairman and works in a senior executive sales advisory position in addition on march 16 2015 we appointed mark hale as our new executive vice president chief operating officer mr hale succeeded peter walsh and reports directly to mr snow mr walsh who has been with factset since 1999 and had been in his current role since 2009 remains with us focusing on various discrete projects 

  

lastly in june 2015 we hired edward bakergreene our firstever chief human resources officer to oversee and grow our critically important employee talent pool 

  

market trends 

  

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations major equity indices continue to experience volatility approximately 825 of our asv is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

  

our investment banking clients that perform ma advisory work provide capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 175 of our asv a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth 

  

we service ma departments capital markets and equity research these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of our clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments 

  

forwardlooking factors

we intend that all forwardlooking statements we make will be subject to safe harbor protection of the federal securities laws as found in section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 these statements involve certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements such risks and uncertainties include among others those listed in part 1 item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k we do not intend and undertake no obligation to update any of our forwardlooking statements after the date of this annual report to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances 

  

business outlook 

    

the following forwardlooking statements reflect our expectations as of october 16 2015 given the number of risk factors uncertainties and assumptions discussed below actual results may differ materially we do not intend to update our forwardlooking statements until our next quarterly results announcement other than in publicly available statements 

  

first quarter fiscal 2 016 expectations includes the impact from the acquisition of portware which was completed on october 16 2015 

  

   

   

   

   

   

dividend payment 

  

on august 10 2015 we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 044 per share the cash dividend of 182 million was paid on september 15 2015 to common stockholders of record on august 31 2015 using our existing cash generated by operations 

  

 

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro japanese yen indian rupee and philippine peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 307 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are estimated to be 2054 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 1747 million to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency 

  

as of august 31 2015 we maintained the following foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure 

  

   

   

   

as of august 31 2015 the gross notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was rs40 billion the gross notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase british pound sterling with us dollars was £105 million the gross notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with us dollars was €181 million 

  

there were no other outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts at august 31 2015 a loss on derivatives of 06 million was recorded into operating income in fiscal 2015 compared to a loss of 03 million a year ago the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings the related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 

  

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2015 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 86 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base had we not had any hedges in place as of august 31 2015 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2015 would result in a decrease in operating income by 152 million over the next twelve months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2015 would increase the fair value of total assets by 284 million and equity by 256 million 

  

 

 

    

interest rate risk 

  

the fair market value of our cash and investments at august 31 2015 was 1824 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value our investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and as such are classified as investments shortterm on our consolidated balance sheet it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events 

  

as of august 31 2015 the fair value of our longterm debt was 350 million which approximated its carrying amount given its floating interest rate basis and was determined based on quoted market prices for debt with a similar maturity the debt bears interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to 050 plus the eurodollar rate which is defined in the agreement as the rate per annum equal to onemonth libor during fiscal 2015 we paid approximately 01 million in interest on our outstanding loan amount it is anticipated that the fair market value of our debt will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates and we do not believe that the value of our debt has been significantly impacted by current market events

factset seeks to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each major type of financial data however this is not possible for all types of data certain datasets that factset relies on have a limited number of suppliers although the company makes every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available which is why factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier in order to meet the needs of its clients the company has entered into third party content agreements with varying lengths and in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates and in other cases on shorter notice no single vendor or data supplier represented 10 or more of factsets total data expenses in any fiscal year presented 

  

client subscription growth

despite competing market data products and services factset believes it can offer clients a much more complete solution because it has one of the broadest sets of functionalities factset provides indepth analytics and superior client service while offering complete content solutions through a desktop user interface or a data feed factset enjoys high barriers to entry and believes it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases the company currently offers in addition factsets applications supported by its client support and service offerings are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysisscreening capabilities they offer as a result the companys products have become central to investment analysis and decisionmaking for clients during fiscal 2014 factset experienced doubledigit growth in client wins against its competitors which underscores the power of the company’s product offering and dedication to client service as well as strengthened factset’s position within its industry

additional information 

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

   




 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 

  

risk factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset’s forwardlooking statements made by or on the company’s behalf include without limitation 

  

factset must continue to introduce new products and enhancements to maintain its technological position 

the market for factset is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards new technologies or industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis and the company’s new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements 

  

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

many of factset’s products as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation their misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of company security measures could expose factset its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company brand and reputation 

  

competition in factset’s industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products its competitors range in size from multibillion dollar companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors may offer price incentives to acquire new business competitive pricing pressures did not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations during fiscal 2014 or in any other fiscal year presented however future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions can also result in clients’ seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services in recent years factset has seen clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors by selecting vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

 

 

  

volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth 

sales cycles for factset can fluctuate and be extended in times where the financial markets are volatile the decision to purchase the factset service often requires managementlevel sponsorship as a result factset often engages in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed because uncertainties in the financial markets can cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments the cycle associated with the purchase of the company’s service offerings depends upon the size of the client 

  

uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause factset to lose additional clients and users 

factset’s sellside clients that perform ma advisory work capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 174 of its revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks while improvements have been observed in the current fiscal year the global investment banking industry continues to experience uncertainty consolidation and business failures which directly impacts the number of prospective clients and users within the investment banking sector a lack of available credit would impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect the company’s financial results and future growth 

  

a decline in equity returns andor fixed income may impact the buying power of investment management clients 

approximately 826 of the company’s annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

  

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for factset 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for factset while the company believes its service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other added value factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources factset’s business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

the company’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for talent including engineering personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships factset’s failure to attract and retain talented employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

  

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows 

the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because 69 of factset’s employees and 45 of its leased office space are located outside the us these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial results and cash flows the company’s primary exposures relate to expenses denominated in british pound sterling euros japanese yen indian rupee and philippines peso this exposure has increased over the past 12 months primarily because the company’s international employee base has risen 5 since august 31 2013 factset’s nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 28 million while its nonus dollar denominated expenses are 196 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 168 million although factset believes that its foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances the company’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on its results of operations 

  

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing datasets or products 

factset is a provider of global financial and economic information on companies worldwide clients have access to the data and content found within these databases which they can combine and utilize in nearly all of the company’s applications these databases are important to the company’s operations because they provide its clients with key information such as company fundamentals estimates global equity ownership ma data events and transcripts earnings and other equity and fixed income data factset aggregates third party content from more than 190 data suppliers 90 news sources and 80 exchanges the company has entered into third party content agreements with varying lengths the agreements in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates in other cases on shorter notice 

  

 

 

  

certain datasets that factset relies on have a limited number of suppliers although the company makes every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available these datasets include without limitation 1 equity pricing from exchanges such as nasdaq 2 global exchange indices 3 sp cusip distribution 4 sp ratings and 5 moody’s investor service corporate ratings however factset is not dependent on any one third party data supplier in order to meet the needs of its clients the company combines data from commercial databases into its own dedicated single online service which the client accesses to perform their analysis the failure of factset to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights   

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms enter into settlements require factset to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients or vendors under contractual provisions of various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue incurring expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

  

a prolonged or recurring outage at factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations however a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers and any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

  

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

factset is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes tax liability or effective tax rates in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before income taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations including its provision for income taxes 

  

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset’s operating results

we also successfully changed factset’s leadership structure to position us well for future success philip snow was named president e ffective july 1 2014 and will be leading our sales and operations teams the expected result is to generate more collaboration between these two teams and expand on our competitive position in the financial information industry

product developments to enhance our workflow solutions 

at factset we are dedicated to building tools to support the workflows of our traditional asset management and investment banking base as well as to extend our core competency to encompass wealth managers sales  trading private equity and hedge funds in order to achieve this goal we set aggressive goals for fiscal 2014 that involved improving the ease of use and speed of our entire product line we invested heavily in new data center technologies as well as our mobile platforms including factset for the ipad and the iphone our goal is to make factset a critical component of the daily workflow for all user classes from the most dataintensive quantitative analyst to clevel executives at our clients 

  

our major fiscal 2014 product developments are highlighted as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

another key development in our continual quest to enhance the factset workstation was created through a new agreement we entered into with quick corporation a japanbased financial information services company in the nikkei inc group together factset and quick will work to integrate the nikkei group’s highquality content with our own global content and workflow solutions in order to provide a premium factset service for redistribution within our asia segment 

  

 

 

  

faster technology 

during fiscal 2014 we made great strides in the execution of project nexgen nextgen is our ongoing assessment of the technologies we use to build support and deploy factset product we continued our mission to evolve away from large mainframe computers to a more distributed environment powered by a vast array of smaller faster and more costeffective machines throughout the year we converted several frontend products and major subsystems to make use of our new technology platform in many cases with dramatic improvements in computational speed and ease of use we also continued our investment in the stateoftheart grid of servers and software systems that support our industryleading fixed income analytics platform fixed income analytical services “fias” our new fias service allows our clients to outsource a significant portion of their fixed income data validation and reconciliation process to factset helping to improve the quality of our fixed income portfolio analysis product line 

  

refinement of our proprietary content 

as our database product lines mature we are no longer focused on hiring massive numbers of collection specialists we now have the opportunity to refine our collection processes the net effect of collecting data more efficiently is improved timeliness accuracy and coverage all of which have translated into increased usage of our proprietary content 

  

fiscal 2014 enhancements to our proprietary content are highlighted as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

continued focus on client service 

client service is a key component of our business model we support our software with a team of financial data and modeling experts client service is performed each and every day via email text instant messaging or phone client touches are a key metric by which we measure the success of our service according to our fiscal 2014 global client satisfaction survey 97 of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with factset’s support the depth of our software the data behind the models and the complex mathematics behind the answers each create an opportunity for us to forge close working relationships with our user community 

  

our reward for investing in a consulting group comprised of several hundred professionals is client loyalty as evidenced by an annual client retention rate of greater than 95 of asv for several years in a row our consulting teams have been trained to listen to our clients’ needs and transfer this knowledge directly to the product development teams helping us transform suggestions into new or enhanced product offerings educating our clients is also an important component of our service not only do we teach our users the nuances of our software and content offerings but factset personnel are often thoughtleaders in a particular area of financial modeling in our rapidly evolving industry as a result clients look to factset as a trusted partner to stay on the cutting edge of financial modeling and analysis during fiscal 2014 nearly 1800 clients attended live or online factset training sessions more than 4000 investment bankers were trained on how to use our systems clients completed 34000 elearning courses in our online library and clients referenced our online help and reference library nearly 700000 times 

  

 

 

  

results of operations   

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report on form 10k 

  

   

revenues 

  

fiscal 201 4 compared to fiscal 201 3 

revenues in fiscal 2014 were 9203 million up 73 compared to fiscal 2013 our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2014 were increases in clients and users continued growth in our portfolio analytics suite of products rising sales of our wealth management workflow solution expansion of proprietary content stabilization within sellside client base and incremental revenues from the recent acquisitions of revere and matrix  

  

growth in the number of clients and users of factset 

during fiscal 2014 we added 200 net new clients as compared to 108 added during 2013 bringing our total client count to 2743 as of august 31 2014 this growth represents an 85 increase in net client additions during the last twelve months as compared to the same period one year ago included in our august 31 2014 client count are 43 clients acquired from the recent revere and matrix acquisitions during the just completed fourth quarter our total client count expanded by 81 compared to 60 in the same period a year ago the addition of new clients is important to us as we anticipate that it lays the groundwork for the ability to provide additional services in the future consistent with our strategy of increasing sales of workstations applications and content at our existing clients our client growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 marked the highest number of client additions that we have ever obtained within a single quarter annual client retention as of august 31 2014 was greater than 95 of asv and 93 when expressed as a percentage of clients an increase from 92 as of the end of fiscal 2013 and our first increase in that metric since august 2011  we believe these statistics underscore the power of our business model as the large majority of our clients maintain their subscriptions to factset throughout each year at august 31 2014 our largest individual client accounted for 2 of total subscriptions and annual subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 15 of total client subscriptions consistent with prior fiscal years 

  

at august 31 2014 there were 54596 professionals using factset an increase of 3628 users from a year ago during the last twelve months our investment management clients added 3449 net new users while our investment banking clients added 179 net new users our user count within the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 alone increased by 2113 users compared to 1409 in the year ago fourth quarter marking this our largest quarterly increase in over three years with significant additions coming from both our investment management and banking clients we observed higher than expected new hire classes at our banking clients as new users increased by 179 compared to a contraction of 35 users during fiscal 2013 we believe this increase is due to observed improvements in the ipo and ma marketplaces coupled with benefits realized from the reinvestment in our wealth management and portfolio analytics suite of products in order to enhance value for our sellside clients as of august 31 2014 our sellside clients represent 174 of our asv 

  

increased subscriptions in our portfolio analytics “pa” suite of products 

our portfolio analytics suite of products including our fixed income in pa product continues to be well received within our client base and was a source of revenue growth for fiscal 2014 the pa suite covers a wide range of workflows around portfolios during fiscal 2014 we saw increased demand from our clients for tools to assist them with multiasset risk modeling which we addressed through the 2014 release of our mac risk model in addition to enhancements to our equity and fixedincome analytics reporting and attribution products we have experienced success in marketing workstations to our users interested in investing in equities and corporate debt requiring a focus on credit analysis addressing this need we introduced several improvements to our suite of reports covering debt and liquidity analysis during fiscal 2014 

  

 

 

  

in addition to the enhancements to our pa products the total number of clients and users subscribing to this suite of products continued to grow we believe this steady growth indicates that our suite remains comprehensive and has highly desired applications for portfolio attribution risk quantitative analysis portfolio publishing and returns based style analysis we continue to see existing clients expand their use of our pa and buy more services that integrate within the portfolio analytics suite 

  

continued sales of our wealth management workflow solution 

wealth management continued to be a growing area for us during fiscal 2014 as our wealth management clients and users benefit from the ability to tailor our workstations to accommodate their needs and improve their competitive position in the past fiscal year we have focused product suite and sales teams to address the workflows of these particular clients aiming to deliver the valueadded service and comprehensive easy to generate reports our wealth management clients continue to express interest in products which are not included within the standard wealth management packages we offer we have found that our clients are using more of our pa suite of products in a manner similar to institutional investors this usage has helped continue our trend of increasing wealth management users for the past five years 

  

expansion of our proprietary content 

we continue to be successful in licensing our proprietary factset data especially factset fundamentals and factset estimates as our global content sales team pursues expanding the distribution of our content this type of data is licensed in feed form and includes ownership transcripts ma and corporate hierarchy data data feeds are consumed by a widerange of clients including existing large factset clients and some outside of our core client base that do not manage money or provide sellside services expansion of our data feed business has created new revenue opportunities for us and with the improvement in our database technology and faster networks many clients have a desire to import and analyze data on their own as a result we have created the technology and content infrastructure to deliver standard or highly customized data feeds for our clients 

  

in addition streetaccount our condensed news product sells strongly across all factset user types and continues to be in demand due to the ability of our clients to receive uptotheminute news offered both through and outside the factset workstation another source of growth within our content set is factset revere revere’s classification hierarchy and supply chain data is now available in the factset workstation by leveraging this data clients can help better identify investment opportunities and measure risk exposure lastly in may 2014 we signed an agreement with quick corp to develop a premium factset service for redistribution in asia by combining our industryleading global content and workflow solutions with the nikkei group’s highquality content 

  

s tabilization within s ell s ide c lient b ase 

asv from our investment banking clients increased 16 during fiscal 2014 as we observed improvements in the ipo and ma marketplaces coupled with benefits realized from the reinvestment in our wealth management and portfolio analytics suite of products in order to enhance value for our sellside clients as of august 31 2014 our sellside clients represented 174 of our asv in addition we experience some seasonality with our investment banking side clients with our fourth quarter typically a strong quarter for new banking hires we saw this trend in the just completed fourth quarter as user count at our investment banking clients increased by 1252 professionals during the past three months 

  

incremental revenue from the acquisitions of revere and matrix 

in september 2013 we acquired the assets of revere data whose taxonomy and supply chain relationship data complements our commitment to provide our clients with unique and insightful content sets at the time of the acquisition revere had annual subscriptions of 5 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we acquired matrix solutions whose primary line of business is to provide intelligence to the uk financial services industry and complements our market metrics business at the time of the acquisition matrix had annual subscriptions of 7 million the acquisitions of revere and matrix increased our global revenue growth rate by 145 basis points during fiscal 2014 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

revenues in fiscal 2013 were 8581 million up 65 compared to fiscal 2012 revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2013 were the use of our advanced applications such as pa growth in our client count and total users incremental revenue from the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012 the expansion of our market metrics business growth of our proprietary content sales and increased usage of our wealth management workflow solutions 

  

 

 

  

revenues by geographic region 

  

   

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

revenues from our us segment increased 64 to 6246 million in fiscal 2014 compared to 5869 million a year ago revenue growth was driven by the addition of users and clients sales of our pa suite of products growth in our wealth management solutions increased demand for our proprietary content and increment revenue from the revere acquisition which increased our us growth rate by 80 basis points revenue growth was partially offset by a contraction in the market metrics business during fiscal 2014 which lowered our us growth rate by 60 basis points 

  

international revenues increased 90 to 2957 million during fiscal 2014 excluding foreign currency effects and the matrix acquisition the year over year international revenue growth rate was 67 comprised of 50 for europe and 122 for asia pacific revenues from international operations accounted for 321 of our consolidated revenues during fiscal 2014 up from 316 a year ago primarily as a result of incremental revenues from the matrix acquisition 

  

european revenues advanced 89 year over year due to sales of our advanced applications additional users and clients and incremental revenue from the matrix acquisition which increased the european growth rate by 360 basis points the asia pacific revenue growth rate of 94 was primarily due to our ability to sell our global content expansion into new markets within asia selling additional services to existing clients and new client and user growth partially offset by a weaker japanese yen which lowered the asia pacific revenue growth rate by 280 basis points 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

our us segment revenues increased 66 to 5869 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 our revenue growth rate in the us was the result of increased sales of advanced applications such as pa growth in client count and total users expansion of the market metrics business growth in wealth management workflow solutions and incremental revenues from the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012 international revenues rose 62 from fiscal 2012 due to a broad selection of global proprietary content clients licensing advanced applications and increases in user and client counts the impact from foreign currency decreased international revenues in fiscal 2013 by 80 basis points european revenues advanced 58 to 2088 million while asia pacific revenues grew 78 to 624 million holding currencies constant the asia pacific revenue growth in fiscal 2013 was 113 

  

annual subscription value asv 

as of august 31 2014 asv was 964 million up 73 organically from fiscal 2013 asv at a given point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscription services being supplied to our clients with proper notice to us our clients are able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time subject to certain contractual limitations 

  

  

  

   

asv from our us operations was 6512 million up 67 organically from a year ago international asv totaled 3124 million as of august 31 2014 up 83 organically from a year ago and represented 324 of our companywide total the percentage of our total asv derived from buyside clients increased from 816 a year ago to 826 at august 31 2014 organic asv growth rates from buy and sellside clients rose to 85 and 16 respectively 

  

 

 

  

the 73 increase in organic asv during fiscal 2014 was driven by the addition of 200 new clients and 3628 users which included the effects of higher than expected new hire classes at our banking clients growth in sales to our wealth management clients increased demand for our pa products and expanded sales of our proprietary content organic asv growth of 73 excludes 12 million of asv acquired from revere and matrix during fiscal 2014 and a 05 million detriment from foreign currency 

  

fiscal 2013 growth in organic asv of 49 million or 59 excludes the impact from foreign currency primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen the rise in asv in 2013 was driven by continued growth of pa the addition of 108 net new clients and 1425 new users the expansion of our market metrics business a rise in proprietary content sales and increased usage of our wealth management workflow solutions 

  

we believe that our asv growth of 73 in fiscal 2014 and 59 in fiscal 2013 highlight the stability and strength of our subscription business model we continue to focus on expanding the business by providing superior analytical applications premier global content and unparalleled client service

cost of services increased 154 to 3537 million as compared to the same period a year ago expressed as a percentage of revenues cost of services was 384 in fiscal 2014 an increase of 270 basis points from a year ago the increase was driven by higher employee compensation additional third party data costs and incremental costs from the revere and matrix acquisitions partially offset by lower computerrelated expenses including depreciation 

  

employee compensation including stockbased compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 300 basis points during fiscal 2014 excluding compensation attributable to the acquired revere and matrix workforces the increase in employee compensation was 250 basis points and due to increased employee headcount and providing annual employee base salary increases since september 1 2013 we have hired 202 net new software engineers and 70 net new consultants who are dedicated to the development enhancement and support of our products third party data costs when expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 10 basis points during fiscal 2014 many of our data contracts are driven by our user and client count so as we continue to grow in these metrics so do our datarelated costs user count rose by 7 while clients grew 10 year over year thus driving up our third party data costs expenses associated with the operations of revere and matrix increased cost of services when expressed as a percentage of revenues by 80 basis points during fiscal 2014 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce stockbased compensation from equity based awards granted incremental third party data costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets 

  

partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2014 was a reduction in computerrelated expenses computerrelated expenses including computer depreciation and maintenance costs decreased 30 basis points in fiscal 2014 as compared to a year ago due to the continued use of fully depreciated equipment and our transition to more efficient and costeffective servers in our data centers 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

cost of services increased 112 to 3064 million in fiscal 2013 compared to 2755 million in fiscal 2012 cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues was 357 in 2013 which was 150 basis points higher than fiscal 2012 due to higher employee compensation expense associated with new hires in consulting engineering and content additional streetaccount expenses and increased stockbased compensation partially offset by lower third party data costs 

 

employee compensation including stockbased compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 190 basis points during fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012 due to new hires in software engineering and consulting increased headcount in our proprietary content collection operations located in india and the philippines and salary increases year over year 

 

 

 

  

excluding 69 million of compensation attributable to the streetaccount workforce the increase in employee compensation was 110 basis points over fiscal 2012 during 2013 we increased headcount at our collection facilities in india and the philippines by 408 added approximately 98 net new engineering and product development employees and 49 net new consultants streetaccount expenses increased cost of services by approximately 100 basis points in fiscal 2013 due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce stockbased compensation expense from equity based awards granted to the new employees and the amortization of acquired intangible assets 

  

partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2013 were lower levels of third party data costs data costs expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due to a slower growth rate in users a reduction in callstreet third party collection fees lower variable fees payable to data vendors based on deployment of their content over the factset platform partially offset by incremental market metrics data collection costs

employee compensation when expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 440 basis points from fiscal 2013 due to a higher percentage of our employee base working in a cost of services capacity versus sga and a prior year stockbased compensation charge of 164 million from the vesting of market metrics and streetaccount performancebased options of our total employee headcount increase in fiscal 2014 79 was within our software engineering content collection and product development teams which are all included within cost of services as such sga employee compensation declined compared to the growth in cost of services   

  

partially offsetting the overall decrease in sga expenses was higher te expense which rose by 20 basis points when expressed as a percentage of revenues the primary drivers for this increase were more client visits by our salesforce higher plane and hotel prices and increased interoffice travel due to our expanding worldwide presence 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

sga expenses increased 97 in fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012 expressed as a percentage of revenues sga expenses increased 100 basis points to 329 in 2013 due to incremental stockbased compensation from the vesting of the market metrics and streetaccount performancebased stock options partially offset by a decline in variable employee compensation due to the vesting of performancebased stock options granted in connection with the acquisition of the market metrics and streetaccount businesses an incremental 164 million in stockbased compensation expense was recognized in sga during fiscal 2013 the incremental 164 million of stockbased compensation increased sga expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues from 310 to 329 

  

operating income and operating margin 

  

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

operating income increased 122 to 3022 million in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year our operating margin for fiscal 2014 was 328 up from 314 a year ago the fiscal 2013 market metrics and streetaccount performancebased stock option charge of 183 million 19 million within cost of services and 164 million in sga reduced our fiscal 2013 operating margin by 210 basis points it is our philosophy to expand profitability over the longterm by reinvesting in the company to grow the topline as opposed to expanding our operating margin our industry is highly competitive so we must continue to invest in our services in order to maintain our position as a premium provider of financial data and analytics the fiscal 2014 operating margin was 70 basis points lower than the prior year adjusted operating margin of 335 as calculated by adding back the 183 million stockbased compensation charge due to acquisitions of revere and matrix in fiscal 2014 which lowered our 2014 operating margin by 80 basis points higher te and data costs and incremental employee compensation within cost of services these reductions were partially offset by a 73 increase in revenues a reduction in computerrelated expenses and lower sga employee compensation 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

operating income declined 13 during fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012 due to higher performancebased stock option expense salary increases year over year and additional hiring within the sales engineering and content collection teams partially offset by lower third party data costs from a slower growing user base and reduced callstreet third party collection fees employee head count grew 9 during fiscal 2013 to a total of 6258 employees at august 31 2013 in addition the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012 negatively impacted fiscal 2013 operating margin by 30 basis points due to higher employee compensation costs and the amortization of acquired intangibles 

  

 

 

  

operating income by segment 

  

   

our operating segments are aligned with how we including our chief operating decision maker manage the business and the demographic markets in which we operate our internal financial reporting structure is based on three reportable segments us europe and asia pacific which we believe helps us better manage the business and view the markets we serve sales consulting data collection and software engineering are the primary functional groups within each segment each segment records compensation including stockbased compensation amortization of intangible assets depreciation of furniture and fixtures amortization of leasehold improvements communication costs professional fees rent expense travel marketing office and other direct expenses expenditures associated with our data centers third party data costs and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the us segment and are not allocated to the other segments the content collection centers located in india and the philippines benefit all of our segments and thus the expenses incurred at these locations are allocated to each segment based on a percentage of revenues 

  

fiscal 201 4 compared to fiscal 201 3 

operating income from our us business increased 190 to 1650 million during fiscal 2014 compared to 1387 million a year ago the increase in operating income is attributable to 378 million of incremental revenues a decrease in computer depreciation and a fiscal 2013 pretax charge of 183 million related to vesting of performancebased stock options which did not recur in fiscal 2014 of the total pretax stockbased compensation charge of 183 million 181 million was recorded within the us segment as it related to primarily usbased businesses operating income growth was partially offset by increases in employee compensation within cost of services a rise in te expenses incremental legal fees and additional expenses from the revere acquisition us revenue growth was driven by an increase in the number of clients and users of factset the continued use of our advanced applications such as pa and growth in sales of wealth management excluding the acquired revere workforce us employee headcount increased 68 over the prior year leading to higher employee compensation costs during fiscal 2014 computerrelated expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and costeffective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers additional expenses from the acquisition of revere lowered us operating income by 10 million for fiscal 2014 

  

european operating income advanced 70 basis points during fiscal 2014 to 1009 million due to revenue growth of 89 partially offset by increases in employee compensation and the impact of the matrix acquisition additional expenses from the acquisition of matrix lowered european operating income by 21 million 

  

asia pacific operating income increased 188 to 363 million compared to 305 million a year ago the increase in asia pacific operating income is from incremental revenues of 59 million partially offset by higher employee compensation the asia pacific revenues growth of 94 during fiscal 2014 was primarily due to our ability to sell our global content expansion into new markets within asia selling additional services to existing clients and new client and user growth 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

operating income from our us business decreased 75 during fiscal 2013 compared to 2012 the decline in operating income in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the pretax charge of 183 million related to the vesting of performancebased stock options higher employee compensation within cost of services and an increase in costs from the june 2012 acquisition of streetaccount partially offset by a 66 increase in us revenues lower third party data costs and a decline in intangible asset amortization expense the us revenue growth was driven by the continued use of our advanced applications such as pa growth in the market metrics suite of products incremental revenues from streetaccount sales of our wealth management solution and growth in the number of clients of factset 

  

european operating income increased 50 to 1002 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in european operating income was due to an 114 million increase in revenues lower employee variable compensation expense a reduction in te spending and lower amortization expense as previously acquired intangible assets became fully amortized european revenues advanced 58 in fiscal 2013 to 2088 million due to the broader selection of global proprietary content and increases in user and client counts and clients licensing advanced applications 

  

asia pacific operating income increased 106 to 305 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in asia pacific operating income was from 45 million of incremental revenues and lower operating expenses due to the impact of foreign currency asia pacific revenue growth year of 78 was due to growth in the global content offering the expansion of our realtime news and quotes and new client and user growth 

  

 

 

  

income taxes net income and diluted earnings per share

income taxes 

  

fiscal 201 4 compared to fiscal 201 3 

the fiscal 2014 provision for income taxes was 919 million up 196 million or 272 from 723 million a year ago this increase was due to a 120 increase in pretax income and the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit on december 31 2013 which limited our ability to realize income tax benefits from the rd credit to only four out of twelve months during fiscal 2014 if the us federal rd tax credit had been reenacted by august 31 2014 the fiscal 2014 annual effective tax rate would have been 287 for comparative purposes excluding the 72 million of income tax benefits in 2013 the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 would have been 293 the adjusted annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 of 287 including a hypothetical full year of rd benefits is 60 basis points lower than the adjusted rate for 2013 due to incremental foreign income taxed at rates lower than the us which lowered the rate by 40 basis points 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2013 our provision for income taxes was 723 million down 159 from 2012 due to income tax benefits of 72 million primarily from the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit in january 2013 and the finalization of the fiscal 2012 tax return our effective tax rate is based on current enacted tax laws and as such prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2013 it did not reflect the rd tax credit in any months of 2012 as the rd credit expired on december 31 2011 the reenactment of the rd tax credit was retroactive to january 1 2012 and resulted in an actual effective tax rate of 267 for the full fiscal 2013 year 

  

net income and diluted earnings per share 

  

fiscal 201 4 compared to fiscal 201 3 

net income increased 65 to 2115 million and diluted earnings per share increased 106 to 492 during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 drivers for the increase include incremental revenues of 622 million or 73 lower stockbased compensation as a result of the 129 million in aftertax charge recorded in fiscal 2013 and a 37 decrease in diluted shares outstanding from share repurchases in the last 12 months the increases in net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 were partially offset by a higher annual effective tax rate from the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit incremental employee compensation within cost of services due to the hiring of 202 net new software engineers and 70 net new consultants a rise in third party data costs from additional users and clients added during the last 12 months and higher employee te 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

net income rose 52 to 1986 million and diluted earnings per share increased 80 to 445 during fiscal 2013 compared to 2012 included in fiscal 2013 were income tax benefits of 016 per diluted share from the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit and the finalization of the fiscal 2012 tax return partially offset by the aftertax charge of 129 million or 029 per diluted share related to the vesting of performancebased stock options drivers of net income and diluted earnings per share growth in fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 were higher levels of revenue lower third party data costs a decline in the amortization of intangible assets and a reduction in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding partially offset by higher compensation costs

foreign currency 

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity

contractual obligations 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here

all of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources future cash dividends will depend on our earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors considered relevant by us and is subject to final determination by our board of directors 

  

significant accounting policies 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

  

critical accounting estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

  

accrued compensation 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 15 of our total employee compensation is variable and discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation as of august 31 2014 was 373 million compared 352 million as of august 31 2013 

  

business combinations 

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent third party appraisal firms our significant assumptions and estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

  

 

 

  

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and domestic production activities deductions our annual effective tax rate was 303 267 and 313 in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest is classified as income tax expense in the financial statements 

  

as of august 31 2014 we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 55 million including 11 million of accrued interest recorded as noncurrent taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements when applicable we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled if recognized the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes for this reason we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

  

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by numerous factors such as changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

  

performancebased equity awards 

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which allows for the issuance of performancebased equity awards to employees accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performancebased equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest at the end of each reporting period management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels however there is no current guarantee that such options will vest in whole or in part 

  

november 201 1 a nnual employee performancebased option grant review 

in november 2011 we granted 665551 performancebased employee stock options none of these performancebased stock options vested because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2013 these performancebased options were recorded as forfeitures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

  

november 2012 annual employee performancebased option grant review 

in november 2012 we granted 1011510 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that vest is based on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2014 based upon the actual organic asv and diluted eps growth in the past two years 20 or 185014 net of options previously forfeited became eligible for vesting as of august 31 2014 which results in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 21 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 31 years the remaining 80 of performancebased options previously outstanding were recorded as forfeitures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 

  

 

 

  

july 2012 performancebased option grant review 

in july 2012 we granted 241546 performancebased employee stock options which are eligible to vest in 20 tranches depending upon future streetaccount user growth through august 31 2017 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the first growth target was achieved thus 20 or 48314 options vested as of august 31 2013 the second 20 tranche vested on august 31 2014 as a result of accelerated expansion of streetaccount users in addition due to the accelerated 2014 growth and forecasted future usage growth we estimated that the third 20 tranche will vest by august 31 2017 this reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that will vest to a total of 60 we were required to record a pretax stockbased compensation charge of 14 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 the change in estimate also resulted in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 09 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 30 years a change up or down in the actual financial performance levels achieved by streetaccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands 

  

   

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2014 

  

matrix and revere performancebased option grants 

in connection with the acquisitions of matrix and revere during fiscal 2014 factset granted 165949 and 36695 performancebased stock options respectively the options granted to key employees of matrix will vest only if asv and operating margin targets related to the matrix business are met during a five year measurement period ending december 23 2018 and the option holders remain employed by factset as of august 31 2014 factset did not believe these targets are probable of being achieved and as such no stockbased compensation expense has been record or is expected to be realized in connection with these options of the 36695 performancebased stock options granted in connection with the revere acquisition factset currently estimates that 18553 options will vest based upon the achievement of certain asv and operating margins during the measurement period ending august 31 2015 this results in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 05 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 4years 

  

revere restricted stock units 

in connection with the acquisitions of revere factset granted 7744 performancebased restricted stock units of the 7744 performancebased restricted stock units granted 3872 are estimated to vest based upon our belief that certain asv and operating margin targets will be achieved during the measurement period ending august 31 2017 as of august 31 2014 unamortized stockbased compensation of 03 million will be amortized to compensation expense over the remaining vesting period of 40 years the remaining 3872 performancebased restricted stock units are expected to be forfeited 

  

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2014 was 576 million 

  

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

  

 

 

  

intangible assets 

intangible assets consist of certain acquired content databases client relationships software technology noncompete agreements and trade names resulting from previous acquisitions and depending on the nature of the intangible asset are amortized on either a straightline or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and twenty years the remaining useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31 2014 and 2013 intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31 2014 and 2013 was 419 million and 362 million respectively our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

valuation of goodwill 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment the guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount this accounting standard update became effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and its adoption has not had an impact on our consolidated financial statements because we have not elected to first assess qualitative factors but have performed the quantitative analysis instead 

  

we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information we determined that there were three reporting units during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 which are consistent with our operating segments because there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 were us europe and asia pacific which reflects the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 and given the significant headroom of fair value in excess of carrying value we determined that there were no reporting units that were deemed at risk and there had been no impairment the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2014 and 2013 was 2856 million and 2446 million respectively 

  

we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption which we include here by reference 

  

market trends 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations major equity indices continue to experience volatility approximately 826 of our asv is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

  

 

 

  

our investment banking clients that perform ma advisory work provide capital markets services and equity research account for approximately 174 of our asv a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth 

  

we service ma departments capital markets and equity research these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of our clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma capital markets and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments

first quarter fiscal 2 015 expectations 

       

dividend payment 

on august 14 2014 we declared a regular quarterly dividend of 039 per share the cash dividend of 162 million was paid on september 16 2014 to common stockholders of record on august 29 2014 using our existing cash generated by operations 

  

 

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro japanese yen indian rupee and philippine peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 28 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 196 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 168 million per year to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency 

  

as of august 31 2014 we maintained foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75 of our indian rupee exposure through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and approximately 50 of our philippines peso exposure through the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet at august 31 2014 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was rs25 billion and 07 million respectively at august 31 2014 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase philippine pesos with us dollars was php2886 million and 01 million respectively a loss on derivatives of 03 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2014 as compared to a loss of 10 million during each of fiscal 2013 and 2012 the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings the related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 

  

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2014 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 46 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base had we not had any hedges in place as of august 31 2014 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2014 would result in a decrease in operating income by 189 million over the next twelve months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2014 would increase the fair value of total assets by 280 million and equity by 253 million 

  

interest rate risk 

the fair market value of our cash and investments at august 31 2014 was 1364 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value our investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and as such are classified as investments shortterm on our consolidated balance sheet it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events

competition 

the market for providing accurate financial information and software solutions to the global investment community is highly competitive the global financial information services industry in which factset competes includes both large and wellcapitalized companies as well as smaller niche firms international and us competitors include market data suppliers news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply the company with financial information included in the factset workstation however the number of data providers servicing the financial industry is in many ways smaller than in prior years and decades the main competitors to factset are bloomberg lp thomson reuters inc and standard  poor’s capital iq bloomberg and thomson reuters comprise approximately 31 and 30 respectively of the market share in the 25 billion global market data and analysis space other competitors and competitive products include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications such as msci inc morningstar inc dealogic plc interactive data corporation dow jones  company inc markit group limited blackrock solutions the yield book inc rimes technologies corporation and wilshire associates incorporated  many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those sold by the company factset’s development of its own robust sets of proprietary content combined with its news and quotes offering have resulted in more direct competition with the largest financial data providers as more services overlap and firms look to cut costs clients are forced to choose just one financial data service provider 

  

despite competing market data products and services factset believes it can offer clients a much more complete solution because it has one of the broadest sets of functionalities factset provides indepth analytics and superior client service while offering complete content solutions through a desktop ui or a data feed factset enjoys high barriers to entry and believes it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases the company currently offers in addition factsets applications supported by its client support and service offerings are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysisscreening capabilities they offer as a result the companys products have become central to investment analysis and decisionmaking for clients while clients may add reduce or cancel services at almost any time switching costs may be high lastly the growth of factset globally means the company can service clients in almost every country 

   

client subscription growth 

annual subscription value at any given point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients at august 31 2013 asv was 888 million up 6 organically from a year ago the increase in asv during fiscal 2013 was driven by broadbased growth across geographical segments continued use of factset advanced applications such as portfolio analysis increased usage of wealth management workflow solutions expansion of the market metrics business continued growth of in proprietary content sales additional clients and users the rollout of annual price increase and increased demand of streetaccount news these growth drivers were partially offset by lower than forecasted new asv from the company’s investment banking clients as the banks continued their reduction in spending and hiring

data centers 

factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems  the company’s global technology infrastructure supports its operations and is designed to facilitate the reliable and efficient processing and delivery of data and analytics to its clients factset’s data centers contain multiple layers of redundancy to enhance system performance including maintaining processing and storing data at multiple data centers user connections are load balanced between data centers and in the event of a site failure equipment problem or regional disaster the remaining centers have the capacity to handle the additional load factset continues to be focused on maintaining a global technical infrastructure that allows the company to support its growing business 

  

factset is evolving away from large mainframe computers to a more distributed environment powered by a vast array of smaller faster and more costeffective machines as part of a multiphase project to be executed over several years factset converted many databases and released several applications on this new platform during fiscal 2013 in addition to investing in the future via this nextgen initiative the company continued to ensure that its existing mainframe architecture functions at the highest level 

  

the company continues to operate fully redundant data centers in virginia and new jersey these data centers handle factset’s entire client capacity in addition the company maintains a vast private wide area network that provides a highspeed direct link between the client’s local network and the data content and powerful applications found on factset’s mainframe machines 

 

 

 

 

corporate history 

the following timeline depicts factset’s growth within the financial industry over the past 35 years 

  

  

investment in content collection 

factset began its investment in content collection in 2000 in order to gain control of the content that its clients needed therefore reducing the dependency on data providers the first step to build the content business was to identify content experts which involved the acquisition of data companies strategically factset assembled a more complete database solution for clients by acquiring lionshares mergerstat callstreet jcf truecourse europrospectuscom a copy of the worldscope database from thomson and streetaccount in the past five years factset created production centers for data collection in india and the philippines which included the identification of new office space the hiring of thousands of new employees and setting up a data collection infrastructure that is the foundation of factset content as of august 31 2013 approximately 55 or 3428 employees at factset focus on content collection the goal for factset content is to find ways to differentiate from competitors along with increasing the timeliness and accuracy of the data and depth of coverage 

  

during fiscal 2013 progress was made in the debt capital structure and fixed income data factset prioritized this content set due to its importance to its clients doing company fixed income and portfolio analysis this targeted approach along with continuously striving to exceed client expectations increased user satisfaction in fiscal 2013 in addition data feeds are an area of focus for the company instead of thinking of data purely as a way to solve a client’s workstation problem the focus was selling data to other parts of those firms where a workstation wasn’t appropriate another way to monetize company content factset provides workflow and productivity solutions and by expanding the company’s presence in the feed business factset is further solving clients problems in another dimension of the marketplace lastly the factset fundamentals team increased timeliness across all markets while also maintaining quality

additional information 

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

 

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 

  

risk factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset’s forwardlooking statements made by or on the company’s behalf include without limitation 

  

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

many of factset’s products as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation their misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of company security measures could expose factset its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company brand and reputation 

  

volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth 

sales cycles for factset can fluctuate and be extended in times where the financial markets are volatile the decision to purchase the factset service offering often requires prospective clients to provide managementlevel sponsorship as a result factset often engages in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed during the client decision process because uncertainties in the financial markets can cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments the cycle associated with the purchase of the company’s service offerings depends upon the size of the client and is subject to a number of significant risks that have impacted asv growth and over which factset has little or no control including broader financial market volatility adverse economic conditions clients budgeting constraints internal selection procedures and changes in client personnel 

  

a decline in equity returns may impact the buying power of factset’s investment management clients 

major equity indices and the global economy have experienced increased levels of volatility approximately 816 of the company’s annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

  

uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause factset to lose additional clients and users 

the global investment banking industry continues to experience uncertainty consolidation and business failures this consolidation has resulted in a reduction in the number of prospective clients and users within the investment banking sector factset’s sellside clients who perform ma advisory work and equity research account for approximately 184 of its revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the continued lack of available credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect the company’s financial results and future growth 

  

factset must continue to introduce new products and enhancements to maintain its technological position 

the market for factset is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards new technologies or industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis and the company’s new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements 

 

 

 

 

the factset brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of the company and its business may be affected by how factset is perceived in the marketplace 

factset’s ability to attract and retain clients is affected by external perceptions of brand and reputation reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity could damage the company’s reputation with clients prospects and the general public although factset monitors developments for areas of potential risk to its reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results 

   

a prolonged or recurring outage at factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations however a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers and any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

  

increased competition in factset’s industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products its competitors range in size from multibillion dollar companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors may offer price incentives to acquire new business competitive pricing pressures did not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations during fiscal 2013 or in any other fiscal year presented however future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions can also result in clients’ seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services in recent years factset has seen clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors by selecting vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for factset 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for factset weak economic conditions also can result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources while the company believes its service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other added value factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources factset’s business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

the company’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for talent including engineering personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships factset’s failure to attract and retain talented employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

  

malicious ignorant or illegal employee acts regarding insider information 

misappropriation of insider information by an employee could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business improper disclosure of the companys insider information could expose factset to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the companys brand and reputation 

  

factset’s ability to integrate newly acquired companies 

factset has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions from time to time acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into factset’s operations and there can be no assurances that factset will manage acquisitions successfully the related risks include the company’s failure to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business factset reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in its industry factset may be required to record a charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on its results of operations 

 

 

 

 

risks of doing business internationally 

during fiscal 2013 approximately 32 of the company’s revenue was generated outside the us as of august 31 2013 the company employed 4370 employees outside the us representing 70 of the employee headcount worldwide and a 12 increase in the last 12 months because factset sells its services outside the us the company is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations including the impact of recessions and market fluctuations adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates difficulty in the enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements difficulties in successfully adapting the company’s products and services to the language regulatory and technology standards of other countries resistance of local cultures to foreignbased companies and difficulties engaging local resources inflation natural disasters in developing countries and political and economic instability 

  

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing datasets or products 

factset is a provider of global financial and economic information on companies worldwide clients have access to the data and content found within these databases which they can combine and utilize in nearly all of the company’s applications these databases are important to the company’s operations because they provide its clients with key information such as company fundamentals estimates global equity ownership ma data events and transcripts earnings and other equity and fixed income data factset aggregates thirdparty content from more than 170 data suppliers 100 exchanges and 90 news sources the company has entered into thirdparty content agreements with varying lengths from as long as five years to as short as on an adhoc basis the agreements in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates in other cases on shorter notice 

  

certain datasets that factset relies on have a limited number of suppliers although the company makes every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available these datasets include without limitation 1 equity pricing from exchanges such as nasdaq 2 global exchange indices 3 sp cusip distribution 4 sp ratings and 5 moody’s investor service corporate ratings however factset is not dependent on any one thirdparty data supplier in order to meet the needs of its clients the company combines the data from commercial databases into its own dedicated single online service which the client accesses to perform their analysis the failure of factset to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of factset’s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 

factset’s success depends significantly upon its proprietary technology factset has registered trademarks and copyrights for many of its products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate factset enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees clients data suppliers and vendors the company seeks to protect its software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws while factset does not believe it is dependent on any one of its intellectual property rights the company does rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect its proprietary rights despite these efforts existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection in addition it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of factset content or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use its proprietary information in addition factset cannot be certain that others will not develop or acquire substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology or that equivalent or better products will not be marketed in competition with its services thereby substantially reducing the value of its proprietary rights 

  

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights   

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms enter into settlements require factset to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients or vendors under contractual provisions of various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue incurring expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

   

 

 

 

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows 

the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because 70 of factset’s employees and 45 of its leased office space are located outside the us these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial results and cash flows the company’s primary exposures relate to expenses denominated in euros british pound sterling japanese yen indian rupee and philippines peso this exposure has increased over the past 12 months primarily because the company’s international employee base rose 12 since august 31 2012 factset’s nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 15 million while its nonus dollar denominated expenses are 169 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 154 million per year although factset believes that its foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances the company’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on its results of operations 

  

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

factset is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes tax liability or effective tax rates in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before income taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations including its provision for income taxes 

  

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset’s operating results 

factset is party to lawsuits in the normal course of business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings  contained in part i of this report 

  

changes in securities laws and regulations may increase expenses or may harm demand 

many of factset’s clients operate within a highly regulated environment in light of the recent conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry the information provided by or resident in the service factset provides to its clients could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving its clients which could result in requests for information from factset that could be expensive and time consuming in addition clients subject to investigations or legal proceedings may be adversely impacted possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reductions in assets under management or diminished operations that would adversely affect the company’s revenues

technology – faster machines and more efficient data integration 

our business is dependent on our ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on our computerbased networks and systems  factset’s global technology infrastructure supports our operations and is designed to facilitate the reliable and efficient processing and delivery of data and analytics to clients we are evolving away from large mainframe computers to a more distributed environment powered by a vast array of smaller faster and more costeffective machines as part of a multiphase nextgen project to be executed over several years we converted many databases and released several applications on this new platform during fiscal 2013 roughly twothirds of all active factset users consume data and analytics from our nextgen linux environment an example of improved speed through the nextgen project is company guide now delivers insights into a company within seconds on the new platform 

  

in addition to investing in the future via the nextgen initiative we continued to ensure that our existing mainframe architecture functions at the highest level through the following technology enhancements released during fiscal 2013 

  

    

refining our proprietary content and data collection processes 

in a relatively short period of time we have hired thousands of new employees and set up a data collection infrastructure that is the foundation of all the factset content offered today as of august 31 2013 approximately 55 or 3428 employees focus on content collection the goal for factset content is to find ways to differentiate from competitors along with increasing the timeliness and accuracy of the data and depth of coverage during fiscal 2013 we made great progress in refining our collection processes focusing on timeliness accuracy coverage completeness cost and usage the net effect of collecting data more efficiently was a decrease in headcount growth and improved timeliness accuracy and coverage the following were several areas whereby we refined and improved our existing proprietary content during fiscal 2013 

  

   

   

   

   

    

 

 

 

growth across all geographies and key metrics 

fiscal 2013 was another successful year for our company as we once again attained record levels of revenues net income diluted earnings per share and free cash flow our just completed fourth quarter produced our best quarter in terms of both client and user additions since fiscal 2011 indicating a strong growth story we continued our history of gaining new clients and users both in the us and worldwide as new and existing clients continue to value our functionality and content we were able to achieve this growth allwhile returning over 388 million to stockholders over the last 12 months through our regular quarterly dividends and shares repurchases

results of operations   

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report on form 10k 

 

   

revenues 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

revenues in fiscal 2013 were 8581 million up 65 compared to the prior year growth was broadbased as we gained positive momentum through adding new clients users and sales in all our us european and asia pacific geographic regions our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2013 were the continued use of our advanced applications such as portfolio analysis “pa” growth in our client count and total users incremental revenue from the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012 the expansion of our market metrics business continued growth of our proprietary content sales and subscriptions annual price increases and increased usage of our wealth management workflow solutions 

  

continued use of our advanced applications such as portfolio analysis 

our portfolio analytics suite of products including our fixed income in pa product continues to be well received within our client base and was a source of revenue growth during fiscal 2013 clients have been buying equity pa seats as they have begun to hire again an encouraging trend that we hope will continue clients have also increased purchases of various other applications within that suite of products within the suite our fixed income in pa product has grown at very attractive rates compared to a year ago as this suite is comprehensive and includes highly desired applications for portfolio attribution risk quantitative analysis portfolio publishing and returns based style analysis the just completed fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was our best quarter in fiscal 2013 for subscription contributions from portfolio publishing spar and our suite of third party risk providers whose models and optimizers are fully integrated in pa 

  

growth in our client count and total users 

a keystone of growth for us is new client acquisition and in the just completed fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we delivered our highest number of net new client wins in the past seven years we have now experienced client growth for 15 consecutive quarters and the total number of clients was 2500 at august 31 2013 this is a net increase of 108 clients during the past 12 months and compares to 155 net new clients during fiscal 2012 new clients typically begin at lower subscription levels and grow over the first few years annual client retention as of august 31 2013 was greater than 95 of asv and 92 when expressed as a percentage of clients consistent with a year ago these metrics indicate to us that our clients are loyal and when we lose clients it is often as a result of ma activity or a business failure that results in firm closure at august 31 2013 our largest individual client accounted for 2 of total subscriptions and annual subscriptions from the ten largest clients did not surpass 15 of total client subscriptions consistent with august 31 2012 

  

at august 31 2013 there were 50925 professionals using factset an increase of 1425 users from a year ago users were flat among investment banking clients but the overall user count still increased during fiscal 2013 due to expansion in our investment management business in the past 12 months our investment management client base has added approximately 1460 users while our investment banking clients have contracted by 35 users investment banking clients remained cautious in fiscal 2013 as they closely reviewed and scrutinized their user populations and rightsized their populations based on how they perceive market opportunities while expanding their users in the fourth quarter due to new hire classes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 total user count increased by 1409 compared to only 61 in the third quarter and 1057 in the year ago fourth quarter the just completed fourth quarter increase was the highest number of user additions for factset since 2011 with significant adds at both investment management and banking clients we believe that although headcount at our investment banking clients is still under pressure this recent new user trend should allow us to make gains on the investment management side which constitutes approximately 184 of our revenues 

 

 

 

 

incremental revenue from the acquisition of streetaccount 

on june 29 2012 we acquired streetaccount to complement our news offering with distilled and crucial market moving information for investment management and banking institutions our streetaccount product receives high client praise as we continue to expand the unique ways the product can make our user base more efficient streetaccount added 115 million of revenue to our operations during fiscal 2013 the revenue growth rate during fiscal 2013 of 65 was positively impacted by 120 basis points from the acquisition of streetaccount excluding streetaccount revenue the revenue growth during fiscal 2013 would have been 53 over the prior year period 

  

expansion of our market metrics business 

our market metrics business continues to be a strong contributor on a relative basis to our growth our market metrics local market share suite of products which was introduced in fiscal 2012 continues to perform well this suite includes mutual fund variable annuity and life insurance analytical products and applications for wholesalers that have enabled senior management to understand the value and penetration of their own products in local markets in greater detail than they have been able to examine before in addition market metrics experienced new growth in the european marketplace during 2013 

  

continued growth of our proprietary content sales and subscriptions 

we continue to be successful in licensing our proprietary factset data especially factset fundamentals and factset estimates this type of data is licensed in feed form and includes ownership transcripts ma and corporate hierarchy data data feeds are consumed by a widerange of clients including existing large factset clients and some outside of our core client base that do not manage money or provide sell side services in addition streetaccount has developed new features that offer timely information to our users in an easy to consume format 

  

annual price increases 

as factset has done for the past several years we issued annual price increases during fiscal 2013 these price increases impacted the majority of our us and nonus investment management clients and resulted in asv growth of 125 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to 129 million a year ago the annual price increases implemented in january 2013 for us investment management clients and march 2013 for nonus investment management clients grew revenues by 78 million during fiscal 2013 

  

increased usage of our wealth management workflow solutions 

during fiscal 2013 we have expanded the factset footprint within our wealth management clients by configuring solutions for their workflow we have experienced positive rates of client and user acquisition both in the us and in europe as we believe we have an effective offering for that segment of the market we have managed to displace competitors in our deployment of our workstations at wealth management clients which is still a relatively new area for us 

  

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

revenues in fiscal 2012 were 8058 million up 109 compared to the prior year included in this total was 18 million from the acquisition of streetaccount on june 29 2012 our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2012 were the continued use of our advanced applications such as pa growth in the number of clients and users new features and enhancements to our competitive product suite expanded deployment of our proprietary data annual price increases the ability to access factset for the ipad and the iphone increased usage of factset in excel by both buy and sellside users growth in our market metrics business and an annual client retention rate that is greater than 95 of asv and 92 in terms of clients these revenue drivers were partially offset by themarketscom cancellation of an earnings estimates feed from us 

  

revenues by geographic region 

  

   

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

our us segment revenues increased 66 to 5869 million in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 growth in our us segment revenues reflects sales of advanced applications such as pa growth in our client count and total users expansion of the market metrics business growth in our wealth management workflow solutions an annual price increase and incremental revenues from the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012 our us investment management client annual price increase implemented in january 2013 drove revenues up by approximately 61 million in fiscal 2013 the acquisition of streetaccount added 115 million of revenue to the us segment during fiscal 2013 as compared to only 18 million in fiscal 2012 these increases were partially offset by a net investment banking user count decrease of 35 due to the pressures faced by many sellside firms today 

   

 

 

 

international revenues in fiscal 2013 were 2712 million an increase from 2553 million in fiscal 2012 the impact from foreign currency decreased international revenues by 20 million year over year european revenues advanced 58 to 2088 million due to a broad selection of global proprietary content an annual price increase for the majority of our nonus investment management clients in march 2013 increases in user and client counts and clients licensing our advanced applications asia pacific revenues grew to 624 million up 78 from a year ago the foreign currency impact attributable to the change in the value of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar decreased revenues by 20 million in fiscal 2013 holding currencies constant asia pacific revenue growth year over year was 113 primarily due to our ability to sell additional services to existing clients and new client and user growth over the last 12 months in march 2013 we issued our annual price increase for the majority of our nonus investment management clients resulting in incremental revenue of 17 million during fiscal 2013 revenues from international operations accounted for 316 of our consolidated revenues during 2013 down slightly from 317 a year ago driven by incremental revenue from streetaccount as well as the strengthening of the us dollar against the japanese yen 

  

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

revenues from our us segment increased 106 to 5505 million in fiscal 2012 compared the same period a year ago our revenue growth rate in the us reflects strong client and user count growth the expanded deployment of our proprietary content an increase in the number of pa users annual price increases and incremental revenues from market metrics international revenues rose 115 in fiscal 2012 due to offering a broader selection of global proprietary content an annual price increase for the majority of our nonus investment management clients in march 2012 increases in user and client counts and clients licensing our advanced applications the impact from foreign currency increased international revenues by 05 million year over year european revenues advanced 105 to 1974 million while asia pacific revenues grew to 579 million up 152 from a year ago holding currencies constant asia pacific revenue growth year over year was 142 

  

annual subscription value asv 

at august 31 2013 asv was 888 million up 59 organically over the prior year asv at a given point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscription services being supplied to our clients with proper notice to us our clients are able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time 

 



  

   

asv from our us operations was 606 million up 58 from a year ago international operations added 11 million in new asv to 282 million during fiscal 2013 representing 32 of our companywide total the percentage of our total asv derived from investment management clients increased from 808 a year ago to 816 at august 31 2013 due to growth in their user and client counts combined with the cautious nature of our sellside clients that led to delays in purchasing decisions 

  

the fiscal 2013 growth in organic asv of 49 million excludes the impact from foreign currency primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen the rise in asv in 2013 was driven by continued growth of pa the net addition of 108 new clients and 1425 new users the expansion of our market metrics business annual price increases a rise in proprietary content sales and increased usage of our wealth management workflow solutions as noted earlier in january 2013 we issued annual price increases for our us investment management clients resulting in asv growth of 91 million and in march 2013 we issued annual price increases for our nonus investment management clients increasing asv by 34 million 

  

fiscal 2012 experienced asv growth of 68 driven by broadbased growth across geographical segments continued use of factset advanced applications such as pa expanded deployment of proprietary data growth in the number of clients and users increased usage of factset in excel by both buy and sellside users growth in the market metrics local market share suite of products a high annual client retention rate annual price increases for the majority of the company’s investment management clients and the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012 these growth drivers were partially offset by a cancellation of an earnings estimates feed to themarketscom as a result of its acquisition by standard  poor’s capital iq and a decline in asv from investment banking clients in the past 12 months as the banks continued their reduction in spending and hiring in january 2012 we issued annual price increases for our us investment management clients resulting in asv growth of 102 million and in march 2012 we issued annual price increases for our nonus investment management clients increasing asv by 27 million 

   

 

 

 

we believe that our continued asv growth in both fiscal 2013 and 2012 highlight the stability of our subscription business model we continue to combine our analytic applications premier global content and client service to foster growth and the expansion of our business 

  

operating expenses 

  

   

 cost of services in fiscal 2013 includes an incremental 19 million from the vesting of performancebased stock options granted in connection with the acquisition of the market metrics business in june 2010 and the streetaccount business in june 2012 these options vested in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013 respectively when the market metrics and streetaccount businesses accelerated to achieve stretch growth targets established on the date of grant 

  

 sga expenses in fiscal 2013 includes an incremental 164 million from the vesting of performancebased stock options granted in connection with the acquisition of the market metrics and streetaccount businesses 

  

 included in operating expenses during fiscal 2011 was an incremental 79 million of stockbased compensation related to an increase in the estimated number of performancebased options scheduled to vest the revised estimate reflects a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of performancebased options scheduled to vest and be expensed 

  

nongaap financial measures  operating income and operating margin calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” have been adjusted in the table below to exclude a fiscal 2013 pretax charge of 157 million related to the vesting of market metrics performancebased stock options a fiscal 2013 pretax charge of 26 million related to the vesting of streetaccount performancebased stock options and a fiscal 2011 pretax charge of 79 million related to an increase in the estimated number of performancebased options scheduled to vest the incremental stockbased compensation recorded during fiscal 2013 reduced operating income by 183 million and operating margin by 210 basis points while the 79 million pretax charge in fiscal 2011 reduced the operating margin by 110 basis points we use these nongaap financial measures both in presenting our results to stockholders and the investment community and in our internal evaluation and management of the business we believe that the nongaap financial measures provided in the table below are useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving goals investors may benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and may also facilitate comparisons to its historical performance the presentation of these nongaap financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap

cost of services 

  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

cost of services increased 112 to 3064 million in fiscal 2013 as compared to 2755 million in the same period a year ago cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues was 357 in 2013 which was 150 basis points higher than in 2012 due to higher employee compensation expense associated with new hires in consulting engineering and content additional streetaccount expenses and increased stockbased compensation partially offset by lower thirdparty data costs 

  

employee compensation including stockbased compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 190 basis points during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due to new hires in software engineering and consulting increased headcount in our proprietary content collection operations located in india and the philippines and salary increases year over year excluding 69 million of compensation attributable to the streetaccount workforce the increase in employee compensation was 110 basis points over the same period last year during 2013 we have increased headcount at our collection facilities in india and the philippines by 408 at august 31 2013 approximately 55 of our employees were involved with content collection in addition to the hiring of employees at our primary content collection sites we grew by approximately 98 net new engineering and product development employees and 49 net new consultants in the past year streetaccount expenses increased cost of services by approximately 100 basis points due to compensation paid to the acquired workforce stockbased compensation expense from equity based awards granted to the new employees and the amortization of acquired intangible assets 

  

higher compensation was also driven by increased stockbased compensation expense due to the vesting of performancebased stock options granted in connection with the acquisition of the market metrics business in june 2010 and the streetaccount business in june 2012 an incremental 19 million in stockbased compensation expense was recognized in cost of services during 2013 

  

in connection with our acquisition of the market metrics business in june 2010 we granted 746415 performancebased stock options which would vest only if accelerated stretch revenue targets were achieved related to the market metrics business and option holders remain employed by factset these options vested in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 when the market metrics business accelerated to achieve the stretch revenue growth targets established on the date of grant resulting in a pretax stockbased compensation charge of 157 million of which 02 million was recorded within cost of services and 155 million within sga the stockbased compensation charge was equal to the grant date fair value of the stock options awarded at the time of the acquisition and represented a cumulative adjustment from a change in the vesting based on achieving the accelerated revenue targets 

  

in june 2012 we acquired the streetaccount business and subsequently in july granted 241546 performancebased employee stock options which are eligible to vest in 20 tranches depending upon future streetaccount user growth through august 31 2017 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the streetaccount business accelerated to achieve the first usage growth target established on the date of grant thus the first 20 or 48314 options vested on august 31 2013 in addition due to the accelerated fourth quarter growth and forecasted future usage growth we estimated that the second 20 tranche will vest by august 31 2017 this vesting reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that will vest to a total 40 which required us to record a pretax stockbased compensation charge of 26 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 of which 17 million was recorded within cost of services and the remaining 09 million within sga 

  

partially offsetting the growth in cost of services during fiscal 2013 were lower levels of third party data costs data costs expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2013 compared to the same period in fiscal 2012 as a result a slowing growth rate in users a reduction in callstreet third party collection fees lower variable fees payable to data vendors based on deployment of their content over the factset platform partially offset by incremental market metrics data collection costs the disparity between third party data cost growth and our overall revenue growth is a result of our continued investment in factset proprietary databases a longterm strategic initiative that is not only costeffective but allows us to create a unique content offering to power our analytical tools

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 1520 of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation as of august 31 2013 was 352 million compared 359 million as of august 31 2012 

  

business combinations 

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms our significant assumptions and estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

   

 

 

 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and domestic production activities section 199 deductions our annual effective tax rate was 267 313 and 284 in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest and related penalties if applicable on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements 

  

as of august 31 2013 we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 54 million including 10 million of accrued interest recorded as noncurrent taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheet unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements when applicable we adjust the previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination results when the position is effectively settled if recognized the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes for this reason we regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

  

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by lower earnings than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher earnings than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the postacquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

  

performancebased equity awards 

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which allows for the issuance of performancebased equity awards to employees accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performancebased equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest at the end of each reporting period management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels 

   

 

 

 

november 2010 annual employee performancebased option grant review 

in november 2010 we granted 734334 performancebased employee stock options none of these performancebased stock options vested because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2012 this reflected a lower performance level than previously estimated and accordingly decreased the number of options that will vest to zero which required us to reverse 14 million of stockbased compensation during fiscal 2012 these performancebased options were recorded as forfeitures in fiscal 2012 

  

november 2011 annual employee performancebased option grant review 

in november 2011 we granted 665551 performancebased employee stock options none of these performancebased stock options vested because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2013these performancebased options were recorded as forfeitures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

  

november 2012 annual employee performancebased option grant review 

in november 2012 we granted 1011510 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that vest is based on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2014 at august 31 2013 we estimated that 20 or 202302 of the performancebased stock options would vest which results in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 36 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period however a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved during fiscal 2014 could result in the following changes to the company’s current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands 

  

   

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2013 

  

july 2012 performancebased option grant review 

in july 2012 we granted 241546 performancebased employee stock options which are eligible to vest in 20 tranches depending upon future streetaccount user growth through august 31 2017 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the streetaccount business accelerated to achieve the first usage growth target established on the date of grant thus the first 20 or 48314 options vested on august 31 2013 in addition due to the accelerated fourth quarter growth and forecasted future usage growth we estimated that the second 20 tranche will vest by august 31 2017 this reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that will vest to a total 40 which required us to record a pretax stockbased compensation charge of 26 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the change in estimate also results in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 12 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of 40 years a change up or down in the actual financial performance levels achieved by streetaccount in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to the current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands 

  

   

 the first 20 of the grant vested during fiscal 2013 and as such there is no remaining expense to be recognized as of august 31 2013 

  

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2013 

  

market metrics performancebased option grant 

in connection with the acquisition of the market metrics business in june 2010 we granted 746415 performancebased stock options which would vest only if accelerated stretch revenue targets were achieved related to the market metrics business and option holders remain employed by us these options vested in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 when the market metrics business accelerated to achieve the stretch revenue growth targets established on the date of grant resulting in a pretax stockbased compensation charge of 157 million the pretax stockbased compensation charge of 157 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was equal to the grantdate fair value of the stock options awarded at the time of the acquisition and represented a cumulative adjustment from a change in the vesting based on achieving the accelerated revenue targets as of august 31 2013 none of these performancebased stock options remain unvested 

   

 

 

 

other performancebased option grants 

we granted 229635 performancebased employee stock options between january 2011 and july 2011 that vest based on achieving certain asv targets of this total 133958 vested during fiscal 2012 53285 vested during fiscal 2013 and 9301 were forfeited due to employee terminations at august 31 2013 we estimate that 7964 of these performancebased stock options will vest based on forecasted asv growth resulting in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 01 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period the remaining 25127 performancebased stock options outstanding are expected to be forfeited 

  

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2013 was 654 million 

  

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

  

intangible assets 

intangible assets consist of certain acquired content databases client relationships software technology noncompete agreements and trade names resulting from previous acquisitions and depending on the nature of the intangible asset are amortized on either a straightline or an accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and twenty years the remaining useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization if the estimate of the remaining useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life there were no adjustments to the useful lives of intangible assets subject to amortization during any of the periods presented these intangible assets have no assigned residual values as of august 31 2013 and 2012 intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset no impairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented the carrying value of intangible assets as of august 31 2013 and 2012 was 362 million and 434 million respectively our ongoing consideration of the recoverability could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

valuation of goodwill 

in september 2011 the fasb issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment the guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount this accounting standard update became effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and its adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements because we did not elect to first assess qualitative factors but performed the quantitative analysis instead 

   

 

 

 

we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information we determined that there were three reporting units during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 which are consistent with our operating segments because there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 were us europe and asia pacific which reflects the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 and determined that there were no reporting units that were deemed at risk and there had been no impairment the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2013 and 2012 was 2446 million and 2458 million respectively 

  

we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption which we include here by reference 

  

market trends 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations major equity indices continue to experience volatility approximately 816 of our annual subscription value is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

  

our investment banking clients who perform ma advisory work and equity research account for approximately 184 of our annual subscription value a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth 

  

we service equity research and ma departments these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of our clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro japanese yen indian rupee and philippine peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 15 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 169 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 154 million per year to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency 

  

as of august 31 2013 we maintain foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 75 of our indian rupee exposure through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2016 40 of our net british pound exposure through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2014 and 50 of our philippines peso exposure through the end of fiscal 2014 we are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet at august 31 2013 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was rs29 billion and 77 million respectively at august 31 2013 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase british pounds with us dollars was £68 million and 01 million respectively at august 31 2013 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase philippine pesos with us dollars was php5159 million and 02 million respectively a loss on derivatives of 10 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings the related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 

   

 

 

 

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2013 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 55 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base had we not had any hedges in place as of august 31 2013 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2013 would result in a decrease in operating income by 148 million over the next twelve months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2013 would increase the fair value of total assets by 290 million and equity by 264 million 

  

interest rate risk 

the fair market value of our cash and investments at august 31 2013 was 2094 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less and are reported at fair value our investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and as such are classified as investments shortterm on our consolidated balance sheet it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events

competition 

the market for providing accurate financial information and software solutions to the global investment community is highly competitive the global financial information services industry in which factset competes includes both large and wellcapitalized companies as well as smaller niche firms international and us competitors include market data suppliers news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply the company with financial information included in the factset workstation the main competitors and competitive products include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications such as bloomberg lp thomson reuters inc standard  poor’s including capital iq msci inc dealogic plc interactive data corporation dow jones  company inc markit group limited the yield book inc polypaths llc and wilshire associates incorporated many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those sold by the company 

despite competing market data products and services factset believes it has one of the broadest sets of functionalities an indicator of the companys competitive position is that it has been able to introduce higher premiumbased pricing across its client base despite ongoing competition from larger vendors factset enjoys high barriers to entry and believes it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases the company currently offers in addition factsets applications supported by its client support and service offerings are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysisscreening capabilities they offer as a result the companys products have become central to investment analysis and decisionmaking for clients while clients may add reduce or cancel services at almost any time switching costs may be high 

recent market trends 

the global equity indices have experienced significant volatility in recent years which has had an impact on the solvency size and buying power of some of factset’s clients despite this challenging climate factset has consistently grown revenues and the company anticipates continued volatility in the financial markets factset believes that these continued volatile market conditions increase the value of factset’s ability to consolidate services for clients including deploying realtime news and quotes and advancing the sales of proprietary content 

yeartodate global equity returns have been impressive thus far in 2012 however this trend is currently shortterm and factset must continue to offer better service than its competitors more relevant content and enhanced applications that bring all the pieces together for a smooth efficient client experience these efforts continue to be the focus for fiscal 2013 as factset looks towards growth and success over the longterm

additional information 

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

 

 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 

risk factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset’s forwardlooking statements made by or on the company’s behalf include without limitation 

a decline in equity returns may impact the buying power of factset’s investment management clients 

major equity indices  eg  dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp 500 and nasdaq composite and the global economy have experienced increased levels of volatility approximately 81 of the company’s annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty may affect factset’s revenues and liquidity 

current global economic and financial market conditions and the potential for the prolongation of the global economic recession could adversely affect factset’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity the worldwide impact of market uncertainty including european economic and financial uncertainty related to sovereign debt issues could materially impact clients including large accounts causing them to go out of business entirely defer reduce or not increase the volume of the subscriptions they purchase from factset in the future or terminate existing relationships a variety of other uncontrollable and changing factors including inflationary pressures political or social unrest terrorist attacks oil prices natural disasters in a specific country or region trade protection measures and health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic could have a material adverse effect on factset’s business and liquidity 

uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause factset to lose additional clients and users 

the global investment banking industry continues to experience uncertainty consolidation and business failures this consolidation has resulted in a reduction in the number of prospective clients and users within the investment banking sector factset’s sellside clients who perform ma advisory work and equity research account for approximately 19 of its revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the continued lack of available credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect the company’s financial results and future growth 

volatility in the financial markets may delay the spending pattern of clients and reduce future asv growth 

sales cycles for factset can fluctuate and be extended in times where the financial markets are volatile the decision to purchase the factset service offering often requires prospective clients to provide managementlevel sponsorship as a result factset often engages in relatively lengthy sales efforts purchases and incremental asv may therefore be delayed during the client decision process because uncertainties in the financial markets can cause clients to remain cautious about capital and data content expenditures particularly in uncertain economic environments the cycle associated with the purchase of the company’s service offerings depends upon the size of the client and is subject to a number of significant risks that have impacted asv growth and over which factset has little or no control including broader financial market volatility adverse economic conditions clients budgeting constraints internal selection procedures and changes in client personnel 

factset must continue to introduce new products and enhancements to maintain its technological position 

the market for factset is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards new technologies or industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis and the company’s new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements 

 

  

  

  

undetected errors or failures found in new products and product enhancements may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of the company’s products 

factset’s products may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations at any point but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released despite significant testing by factset and by current and potential clients errors may not be found in new products until after release factset’s data may also inadvertently include errors made by human misinterpretation of news and other types of information although factset attempts to prevent or correct errors they may result in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance damage to the company’s reputation client dissatisfaction and reductions in revenues and margins any of which could harm our business 

increased competition in factset’s industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products its competitors range in size from multibillion dollar companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors may offer price incentives to acquire new business competitive pricing pressures did not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations during fiscal 2012 or in any other fiscal year presented however future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions can also result in clients’ seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services in recent years factset has seen clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors by selecting vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected 

increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for factset 

in recent years more free or relatively inexpensive information has become available particularly through the internet and this trend may continue the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for factset weak economic conditions also can result in clients seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources while the company believes its service offering is distinguished by such factors as customization timeliness accuracy easeofuse completeness and other added value factors if users choose to obtain the information they need from public or other sources factset’s business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

the factset brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of the company and its business may be affected by how factset is perceived in the marketplace 

factset’s ability to attract and retain clients is affected by external perceptions of brand and reputation reputational damage from negative perceptions or publicity could damage the company’s reputation with clients prospects and the general public although factset monitors developments for areas of potential risk to its reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results 

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

many of factset’s products as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation their misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of company security measures could expose factset its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company brand and reputation 

a prolonged or recurring outage at factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations however a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers and any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

 

  

  

  

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt factset’s operations 

despite factset’s implementation of network security measures its servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with the company’s computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on factset’s business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine the company’s own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm factset’s business operating results and financial condition to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations by clients factset’s business operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

malicious ignorant or illegal employee acts regarding insider information 

misappropriation of insider information by an employee could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business improper disclosure of the companys insider information could expose factset to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the companys brand and reputation 

factset’s ability to integrate newly acquired companies 

factset has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions from time to time acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into factset’s operations and there can be no assurances that factset will manage acquisitions successfully the related risks include the company’s failure to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business factset reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in its industry factset may be required to record a charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on its results of operations 

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

the company’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for talent including engineering personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships factset’s failure to attract and retain talented employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

an unforeseen increase in factset’s employee cost structure may reduce growth the company’s operating income 

increases in factset’s cost structure related to hiring benefit costs salary levels variable compensation and other factors may reduce growth in operating income   if the company is unable to manage operating costs as anticipated or operating costs are higher than expected factset’s operating results may fluctuate significantly factset has made significant investments in its employee base in recent years factset also made adjustments to employee salaries to remain competitive and benefit costs have also increased if employee compensation expenses exceed the company’s expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly factset’s profitability may be reduced and results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected 

risks of doing business internationally 

during fiscal 2012 approximately 32 of the company’s revenue was generated outside the us as of august 31 2012 the company employed 3895 employees outside the us representing 68 of the employee headcount worldwide and a 10 increase in the last 12 months because factset sells its services outside the us the company is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations including the impact of recessions and market fluctuations adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates difficulty in the enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements difficulties in successfully adapting the company’s products and services to the language regulatory and technology standards of other countries resistance of local cultures to foreignbased companies and difficulties engaging local resources inflation natural disasters in developing countries and political and economic instability 

 

  

  

  

factset’s ability to integrate and market factset proprietary data as a high quality asset 

the company offers proprietary datasets that include the latest most accurate information available wherever possible including fundamentals estimates ownership corporate new issues people private equity and venture capital mergers and acquisitions corporate events and transcripts fixed income global filings and benchmark data factset understands that data is part of a broader investment process so the company makes timeliness and reliability a priority in order to ensure accuracy timeliness and reliability of the data factset must continue to build on its content collection operations to populate the proprietary content databases this complex process involves hiring training and retaining thousands of employees and successfully deploying collection software and processes 

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing datasets or products 

factset is a provider of global financial and economic information on companies worldwide clients have access to the data and content found within these databases which they can combine and utilize in nearly all of the company’s applications these databases are important to the company’s operations because they provide its clients with key information such as company fundamentals estimates global equity ownership ma data events and transcripts earnings and other equity and fixed income data factset aggregates thirdparty content from more than 85 data suppliers and over 100 news sources and exchanges the company has entered into thirdparty content agreements with varying lengths from as long as five years to as short as on an adhoc basis the agreements in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates in other cases on shorter notice 

certain datasets that factset relies on have a limited number of suppliers although the company makes every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available these datasets include without limitation 1 equity pricing from exchanges such as nasdaq 2 global exchange indices 3 sp cusip distribution 4 sp ratings and 5 moody’s investor service corporate ratings however factset is not dependent on any one thirdparty data supplier in order to meet the needs of its clients the company combines the data from commercial databases into its own dedicated single online service which the client accesses to perform their analysis the failure of factset to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of factset’s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 

factset’s success depends significantly upon its proprietary technology factset has registered trademarks and copyrights for many of its products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate factset enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees clients data suppliers and vendors the company seeks to protect its software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws while factset does not believe it is dependent on any one of its intellectual property rights the company does rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect its proprietary rights despite these efforts existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection in addition it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of factset content or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use its proprietary information in addition factset cannot be certain that others will not develop or acquire substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology or that equivalent or better products will not be marketed in competition with its services thereby substantially reducing the value of its proprietary rights 

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights 

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms enter into settlements require factset to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients or vendors under contractual provisions of various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue incurring expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

catastrophic events could adversely affect factset’s business 

catastrophic events such as abrupt political change terrorist acts conflicts or wars may cause damage or disruption to the economy financial markets and factset’s clients the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts wars or political unrest have created many economic and political uncertainties although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events they could unsettle the financial markets or result in a decline in the financial industry’s spending which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues further such disruptions could cause further instability in the financial markets or the spending of factset’s clients and prospects upon which the company depends on 

 

  

  

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows 

the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because 68 of factset’s employees and 45 of its leased office space are located outside the us these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial results and cash flows the company’s primary exposures relate to nonus dollar denominated expenses within europe japan india and the philippines this exposure has increased over the past 12 months primarily because the company’s international employee base rose 10 since august 31 2011 the financial statements of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses factset’s nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 17 million while its nonus dollar denominated expenses are 163 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 146 million per year to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations the company utilizes derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts although factset believes that its foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances the company’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on its results of operations 

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

factset is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes tax liability or effective tax rates in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before income taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its provision for income taxes and tax liability 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset’s operating results 

factset is party to lawsuits in the normal course of business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings  contained in part i of this report 

changes in securities laws and regulations may increase expenses or may harm demand 

many of factset’s clients operate within a highly regulated environment in light of the recent conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry the information provided by or resident in the service factset provides to its clients could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving its clients which could result in requests for information from factset that could be expensive and time consuming in addition clients subject to investigations or legal proceedings may be adversely impacted possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reductions in assets under management or diminished operations that would adversely affect the company’s revenues 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the us established the new federal bureau of consumer financial protection the “bcfp” and will require the bcfp and other federal agencies to implement many new rules while the general framework of the reforms is set forth in the doddfrank act it provides for numerous studies and reports and the adoption and implementation of rules and regulations by regulatory agencies over the following four years to clarify and implement the acts requirements fully factset believes that it is too early to know the precise longterm impact on its business of the increased regulation of financial institutions demand could be negatively impacted by the deferral of purchase decisions by its clients until the new regulations have been adopted and the full impact and expense of the new regulatory environment is more clearly understood the doddfrank act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types many of which may have an impact on factset’s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways accordingly it is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the doddfrank act and the forthcoming implementing rules and regulations will have on the company and the financial services industry additionally as a publiclytraded company factset is subject to significant regulations including the doddfrank act and the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 there are significant corporate governance and executive compensationrelated provisions in the doddfrank act that require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas factset’s efforts to comply with these requirements could result in an increase in its operating and compliance costs 

 

  

  

  

changes in accounting may affect factset’s reported earnings and operating income 

factset prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles and accompanying accounting standards implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of its business are highly complex and involve judgments changes in accounting rules their interpretation or changes in the company’s business could significantly change its reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures without a comparable underlying change in cash flows from operations in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements factset uses certain estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and managements knowledge of current events and actions that factset may undertake in the future significant estimates have been made in areas that include receivable reserves accrued compensation allocation of purchase price to assets and liabilities acquired income taxes stockbased compensation valuation of goodwill and useful lives and valuation of fixed and intangible assets in addition factset makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion and therefore actual results may differ 

internal controls may be ineffective 

effective internal controls are necessary to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 factset is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including managements assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in its implementation its business and operating results could be adversely impacted

partially offsetting new lease agreements entered into during fiscal 2012 was the consolidation of the east grinstead office into the larger london office this consolidation was completed in march 2012 and resulted in a reduction in leased office space by 3853 rentable square feet at the time factset exited the office space in east grinstead in march 2012 there were seven months remaining on the lease and less than 01 million in remaining rental payments due

fiscal 2012 in review 

our fiscal 2012 results continue to demonstrate the success factset has had in the marketplace the strength of our business model continues to generate stockholder value as illustrated by our doubledigit revenue and diluted earnings per share growth robust top and bottomline growth was achieved despite volatility in the financial markets that may have interrupted shortterm buying patterns from our clients as the economy remains volatile results indicate our philosophy of consistently investing for the future is paying off each of our key operating metrics experienced healthy growth as we added 155 net new clients and 1400 new users since august 31 2011

we have experienced net new client growth for 11 consecutive quarters it is rewarding to see net new client growth for 11 consecutive quarters against a backdrop of economic volatility where we have seen uncertain economic times stifle new firm creation and extend the timeframes clients take to make large spending decisions the total number of factset clients as of august 31 2012 was 2392 a net increase of 155 clients during the past 12 months as compared to 127 net new clients during fiscal 2011 excluding the streetaccount acquisition we added 57 net new clients during the fourth quarter of 2012 this represented the highest quarterly total in six years adding new clients is one of the first steps for us in increasing asv new clients typically begin at lower asv levels and grow over the first few years at august 31 2012 our largest individual client accounted for 2 of total subscriptions and annual subscriptions from the ten largest clients did not surpass 16 of total client subscriptions consistent with august 31 2011 

at august 31 2012 there were 49500 professionals using factset an increase of 1400 users from a year ago users declined among sellside clients but the overall user count still increased by 1400 on a net new basis during fiscal 2012 due to penetration on the buyside in the past 12 months our investment management client base has added approximately 1900 users while our investment banking clients have contracted by 500 users these investment banking clients were cautious in fiscal 2012 as they closely reviewed and scrutinized their user populations and rightsized their populations based on how they perceive market opportunities many of them experienced headcount reductions which lowered our investment banking user count however in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 total user count increased by 1100 due to growth in both the investment management and banking businesses this user count growth was strong when considering the high season of hiring for sellside banks is in the summer and our belief that new hires declined by approximately 20 compared to 2011 

new features and enhancements to our competitive product suite 

though global market volatility resulted in a business environment less favorable to our clients factset continued to provide a highly competitive product suite despite widespread expense reduction programs at our clients fiscal 2012 saw factset gain market share as a result our client and user counts expanded to record highs we successfully released new features and enhancements to the factset workstation during fiscal 2012 speed and software stability improvements were highlights and made our system even more compelling to our clients as in the prior year our client product usage growth rate exceeded our subscription growth rate signaling that we delivered more value per dollar of subscription to our clients 

realtime users have increased every quarter since the product was released in 2002 realtime news and quotes is a product that services the needs of a global investor and continues to be a source of revenue growth for us deployment of realtime news and quotes has resulted in a significant increase in user count over the last 12 months in addition the ability for our end users to access more than 85 premium thirdparty content providers and 100 exchanges and integrate their own data for use in factset applications continues to support revenue growth 

expanded deployment of our proprietary data 

factset proprietary content has been a solid contributor to our total revenue growth in fiscal 2012 as our proprietary multiyear content initiative took form during fiscal 2012 we believe that several of our content offerings have become superior to those of our competitors enhancements to a multitude of our content offerings were incorporated into factset during fiscal 2012 we have been successful in licensing proprietary factset data and in particular factset fundamentals and factset estimates the types of data licensed in feed form include ownership transcripts ma and corporate hierarchy data among others data feeds are consumed by a range of clients including existing large factset clients and some who do not manage money or provide sellside services 

 

  

  

annual price increase 

as factset has done for the past several years we issued annual price increases during fiscal 2012 these price increases impacted the majority of our us and nonus investment management clients and resulted in asv growth of 13 million during 2012 as compared to 11 million a year ago the annual price increases implemented in january 2012 for us investment management clients and march 2012 for nonus investment management clients grew revenues by 82 million during fiscal 2012 compared to last year the annual price increases implemented in january and march 2011 contributed an additional 4 million in revenues in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

factset mobility 

we went mobile in fiscal 2012 with factset for the ipad and the iphone supplementing our flagship workstation offering with the same data and analytical products on mobile devices client feedback for these offerings has been extremely positive and embeds our service even further into our clients’ daily workflows 

increased usage of factset in excel by both buy and sellside users 

weve been pleased by the increased usage of factset in excel by both buy and sellside users this increased client engagement level was brought about by the release of sidebar a year ago which is the new factset for excel sidebar enhances the workflow of the user by making it simple and easy to customize and derive great value straight from excel one of the most widelyused software platforms in our industry 

annual client retention rates 

consistent with last year our annual client retention rate was greater than 95 of asv at august 31 2012 as a percentage of actual clients the annual retention rate was 92 at august 31 2012 also consistent with last year we believe these statistics which have remained consistent since last year despite a volatile global economy demonstrate to us that our clients continue to be engaged with our services and derive value from them 

growth in the market metrics business 

the market metrics mutual fund local market share product that we introduced last year has been performing well in addition to mutual funds we have expanded the local market share suite of products to include variable annuity life insurance and applications for wholesalers the local market share suite of products has enabled senior management to understand the value and penetration of their own products in local markets in greater detail than they have been able to examine before 

acquisition of streetaccount 

on june 29 2012 we acquired streetaccount to complement our news offering with distilled and crucial market moving information for buy and sellside institutions at the time of acquisition streetaccount had annual subscriptions of 114 million during fiscal 2012 streetaccount added 18 million of revenue to our operations however the acquisition of sa did not have an impact on our fourth quarter diluted earnings per share 

partially offsetting the positive revenue drivers discussed above was a cancellation of an earnings estimates feed to themarketscom as a result of its acquisition by sp capital iq and a decline in asv from investment banking clients in the past 12 months as the banks continued their reduction in spending and hiring in late 2010 capital iq a standard  poor’s business and a subsidiary of the mcgrawhill companies acquired the research and estimates business of themarketscom factset had previously negotiated an agreement to provide themarketscom with an earnings estimates feed and this agreement was subsequently cancelled in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 reducing asv by 41 million however total user count was not impacted as a result of the cancellation because the agreement provided an earnings estimates feed without any workstations 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

revenues in fiscal 2011 were 7265 million up 133 from 6411 million in 2010 increased revenues were from successes across our product suite and in all geographic locations the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was a record quarter for us as asv grew by 37 million rising to 779 million at august 31 2011 during fiscal 2011 our user count increased by 5300 net new clients rose to 127 and annual subscriptions increased by 93 million organically broadbased growth was the catalyst for accelerating our asv growth rate to 14 in fiscal 2011 our investment management clients experienced strong growth and for much of fiscal 2011 the global financial markets were in positive territory thus encouraging many of our clients to invest in people and in their business partnerships this positive business environment coupled with our strategy of continual product and service enhancements translated into progress in each of our key metrics we also invested heavily in the product during 2011 releasing four new versions each with many new features and improvements in speed and stability our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2011 were broadbased growth across our geographical segments clients continued use of our advanced applications such as portfolio analysis growth in the number of clients and users new functionality within factset that improves our clients’ workflows by consolidating multiple services into one platform the expanded deployment of our proprietary data incremental revenue from the acquisition of market metrics on june 1 2010 an increase in the client retention rate and annual price increases 

 

  

  

  

revenues by geographic region 

 

 

revenues from our us segment increased 106 to 5505 million in fiscal 2012 compared the same period a year ago our revenue growth rate in the us reflects strong client and user count growth the expanded deployment of our proprietary content an increase in the number of pa users annual price increases incremental revenues from market metrics and the acquisition of streetaccount the annual price increase for our us investment management clients in january 2012 drove revenues up by approximately 68 million in fiscal 2012 streetaccount added 18 million of revenue to the us segment since its acquisition in june 2012

our us segment revenue increased 143 to 4976 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 2010 excluding the acquisition of market metrics on june 1 2010 us revenues grew 113 in fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period a year ago international revenues were up 113 to 2289 million in fiscal 2011 compared to the same period a year ago the impact from foreign currency increased international revenues by 14 million year over year european revenues advanced 105 due to offering a broader selection of global proprietary content coupled with user and client growth excluding the impact of foreign currency asia pacific revenue growth was 109 year over year the annual price increases for our us investment management and banking and brokerage clients in january 2011 drove revenues up by approximately 6 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to 5 million in fiscal 2010 

annual subscription value “asv” 

at august 31 2012 asv was 843 million up 7 organically over the prior year asv at a given point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscription services being supplied to our clients with proper notice to us our clients are able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time 

 

 

 

  

 

asv from our us operations was 572 million up 28 million from a year ago excluding acquired streetaccount asv asv from international operations increased 25 million since the beginning of the fiscal year and totaled 271 million at august 31 2012 representing 32 of our companywide total the percentage of our total asv derived from investment management clients increased from 79 a year ago to 81 at august 31 2012 

 

  

  

  

the increase in asv during fiscal 2012 was driven by broadbased growth across geographical segments continued use of factset advanced applications such as pa expanded deployment of proprietary data growth in the number of clients and users increased usage of factset in excel by both buy and sellside users growth in the market metrics local market share suite of products a high annual client retention rate annual price increases for the majority of the company’s investment management clients and the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012 which at the time of acquisition had annual subscriptions of 114 million these growth drivers were partially offset by a cancellation of an earnings estimates feed to themarketscom as a result of its acquisition by standard  poor’s capital iq and a decline in asv from investment banking clients in the past 12 months as the banks continued their reduction in spending and hiring as noted earlier in january 2012 we issued annual price increases for our us investment management clients resulting in asv growth of 10 million and in march 2012 we issued annual price increases for our nonus investment management clients increasing asv by 3 million 

fiscal 2011 experienced asv growth of 14 driven by purchases of growth in the number of clients and users the expanded deployment of proprietary data an increase in the client retention rate asv growth in the market metrics business and an annual price increase for our clients in january 2011 we implemented an annual price increase for the majority of our us investment management clients and a smaller percentage of our us global banking and brokerage business this price increase resulted in asv growth during fiscal 2011 of 9 million in addition in march 2011 we rolled out an annual price increase for our nonus investment management clients which increased asv by 2 million 

we believe that our continued asv growth in both fiscal 2012 and 2011 highlight the stability of our subscription business model we continue to combine our analytic applications premier global content and client service to foster growth and the expansion of our business 

  

operating expenses 

 

  

 included in operating expenses during fiscal 2011 was an incremental 79 million of stockbased compensation related to an increase in the estimated number of performancebased options scheduled to vest the revised estimate reflects a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of performancebased options scheduled to vest and be expensed the pretax stockbased compensation charge of 79 million reduced the company’s operating margin by 110 basis points from 339 to 328 during fiscal 2011

lower computer depreciation and amortization of intangible assets expense partially offset higher compensation and data costs during fiscal 2012 compared to the same period a year ago computerrelated expenses including depreciation and computer maintenance costs decreased 55 basis points in fiscal 2012 as compared to a year ago due to the transition to more efficient and costeffective servers in our data centers and the use of fully depreciated servers the cost per server and related maintenance continues to decline as we have become more efficient in our data centers amortization of intangible assets declined 25 basis points from a year ago as additional intangible assets became fully amortized during 2012 while revenues increased over the same period by 11 amortization expense from intangible assets acquired from the streetaccount acquisition in june 2012 was not material to fiscal 2012

lower third party data costs computerrelated expenses and communication costs partially offset the overall increase in cost of services during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 third party data costs expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 80 basis points for the twelve months ended august 31 2011 compared to the same period in fiscal 2010 due to a reduction in data expense associated with the end of the thomson reuters transition services agreement and the increased focus on collecting more proprietary content which is recorded as employee compensation as opposed to paying for third party data content computerrelated expenses including depreciation and computer maintenance costs decreased 70 basis points expressed as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2011 as compared to a year ago due to the continued use of fully depreciated servers communication costs expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to implementing more cost effective means to connect clients to our data centers

operating income from our us business increased 11 to 1500 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 1353 million a year ago the increase in operating income was primarily due to 529 million of incremental revenues lower interoffice travel a prior year internal us sales conference that did not reoccur in fiscal 2012 lower computer depreciation and a decline in intangible asset amortization expense partially offset by higher employee compensation within cost of services and an increase in data costs our revenue growth of 106 in the us reflects strong client and user count growth the expanded deployment of our proprietary content an increase in the number of pa users annual price increases incremental revenues from market metrics and 18 million in revenues from the acquisition of streetaccount computerrelated expenses decreased due to the transition to more efficient and costeffective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers us employee headcount increased 7 over the prior year leading to higher employee compensation costs in fiscal 2012 

european operating income increased 20 to 954 million during fiscal 2012 compared to the same period a year ago the increase in european operating income is due to an 187 million increase in revenues lower employee variable compensation expense a reduction in te spending and lower amortization expense as previously acquired intangible assets become fully amortized european revenues advanced 105 to 1974 million due to our broader selection of global proprietary content an annual price increase for the majority of our nonus investment management clients in march 2012 increases in user and client counts and clients licensing our advanced applications

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

operating income from our us segment increased 8 to 1353 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 1250 million a year ago the increase in operating income was primarily due to 622 million of incremental revenues and lower data and computerrelated expenses partially offset by higher employee compensation including incremental performancebased stock option expense and a rise in our te spend our revenue growth in the us reflects client and user growth incremental revenues from market metrics we expanded the number of pa users and an increase in the client retention rate variable fees payable to data vendors based on deployment of their content over the factset platform declined as the result of increased client usage of our proprietary content computerrelated expenses decreased due to the continued use of fully depreciated servers the increase in employee compensation is due to an 18 headcount growth in the us and higher stockbased compensation expense to reflect the incremental charge from performancebased stock options 

european operating income increased 10 to 796 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 722 million in the same period a year ago the 10 growth in european operating income was due to a 170 million increase in revenues and lower variable fees payable to data vendors partially offset by higher te expenses the increase in european revenues was due to increases in user and client counts a broader offering of global proprietary content increased licenses to clients for our advanced applications and growth in our realtime news and quotes european te expenses rose primarily due to a 25 increase in airline ticketing fees and hotel stays in order to visit more clients as well as more trips to our data content collection operations in india and the philippines

other income income taxes net income and diluted earnings per share   

 

  

 included in the provision for income taxes during fiscal 2011 were income tax benefits of 63 million from the finalization of the fiscal 2010 tax return and the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit in december 2010 our effective tax rate is based on current enacted tax laws and as such prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2011 it did not reflect the rd tax credit in any months of fiscal 2011 as the rd credit expired on december 31 2009 the reenactment of the credit was retroactive to january 1 2010 and resulted in an actual effective tax rate of 284 for the full fiscal 2011 year 

other income 

  

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

other income rose by 11 million during fiscal 2012 due to our 15 million purchase of shortterm certificates of deposit in october 2011 these deposits have maturities of less than one year and resulted in interest income of 11 million during fiscal 2012 excluding our returns on the shortterm certificates of deposit our average annualized return on cash and cash equivalents remained relatively flat at 32 basis points during fiscal 2012 compared to 33 basis points in fiscal 2011 at no time during fiscal 2012 and 2011 did a component of our cash cash equivalents and investments portfolio experience a decline in value due to a ratings change default or increase in counterparty credit risk 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

other income during fiscal 2011 was consistent with fiscal 2010 levels as the federal reserve maintained low us interest rates which kept returns on our cash and cash equivalents low 

income taxes 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

the provision for income taxes was 859 million up 26 from 679 million in fiscal 2011 due a 15 increase in pretax income year over year and income tax benefits of 63 million recorded in fiscal 2011 from the finalization of the fiscal 2010 tax return and the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit in december 2010 our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 313 290 basis points higher than our annual effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 primarily due to the income tax benefits previously disclosed the fiscal 2011 annual effective tax rate before discrete items of 63 million was 309 or 40 basis points lower than the 2012 effective tax rate due to the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit on december 31 2011 we expect that the us federal rd tax credit will be reenacted as it has been for the past 30 years however we are not permitted to factor it into our effective tax rate unless it is part of currently enacted tax law as such the expiration of the rd credit negatively impacted our fiscal 2012 annual effective tax rate by 130 basis points 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

during fiscal 2011 the provision for income taxes decreased 6 to 679 million as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to income tax benefits of 63 million from the finalization of the fiscal 2010 tax return and the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit in december 2010 partially offset by an 8 increase in income before income taxes our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 before discrete items of 63 million was 309 200 basis points lower than our annual effective tax rate before discrete items of 329 in fiscal 2010 the decrease year over year was primarily due to higher levels of nonus taxable income increased rd activity which increased our related rd tax credit and a rise in our domestic production activities section 199 deduction 

net income and earnings per share 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

net income rose 10 to 1888 million and diluted earnings per share increased 14 to 412 during fiscal 2012 compared to the same period a year ago included in fiscal 2011 were income tax benefits of 013 per diluted share from finalizing our 2010 us tax return and the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit partially offset by a pretax charge of 79 million 54 million aftertax or 011 per diluted share related to an increase in the estimated number of performancebased stock options that were eligible to vest drivers of net income and diluted earnings per share growth in fiscal 2012 were higher levels of revenue lower te decreased computer depreciation and amortization of intangible assets and a reduction in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding partially offset by higher compensation and a higher effective tax rate due to the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit 

 

  

  

  

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

net income rose 14 to 1710 million and diluted earnings per share increased 15 to 361 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 as mentioned above fiscal 2011 included income tax benefits of 013 per diluted share partially offset by a pretax charge of 79 million or 011 per diluted share drivers of net income and diluted earnings per share growth were higher levels of revenue lower data costs decreased computerrelated expenses a lower effective tax rate and a reduction in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding partially offset by higher compensation including incremental performancebased stock option expense and additional te spend it remains our philosophy to expand over the longterm by investing in our employees to retain our position as a premium provider of financial information and analytical tools 

  

foreign currency 

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity 

 

our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 17 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 163 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 146 million per year our foreign currency exchange exposure is related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where approximately 68 of our employees are located during fiscal 2012 foreign currency movements increased operating income by 13 million in fiscal 2011 operating income decreased by 01 million from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 

during fiscal 2012 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 90 of our indian rupee exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 75 of our indian rupee exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and 50 of our indian rupee exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 additional foreign currency forward contracts were entered into to hedge approximately 50 of our net euro exposure through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2013 at august 31 2012 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was 363 million and 24 million respectively at august 31 2012 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with us dollars were €81 million and 01 million respectively at august 31 2012 there were no other outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts a loss on derivatives for during fiscal 2012 of 10 million was recorded into operating income in our consolidated statements of income compared to a gain of 42 million a year ago

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 1890 million or 27 of our total assets at august 31 2012 compared with 1817 million at august 31 2011 or 28 of our total assets all of our operating and capital expense requirements were financed entirely from cash generated from our operations our cash and cash equivalents increased 74 million in the past 12 months due to cash provided by operations of 2320 million 337 million from the exercise of employee stock options and 112 million of tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements partially offset by cash outflows of 1536 million related to stock repurchases dividend payments of 500 million capital expenditures of 225 million the purchase of the streetaccount business for 213 million net of cash acquired 150 million from purchases of investments and 70 million from the effect of exchange rate changes on our foreign cash balances 

free cash flow generated over the last twelve months was 2094 million up 18 over the prior year and exceeded net income by 11 free cash flow during fiscal 2012 was generated from a record level of net income positive working capital changes higher noncash expenses and a year over year decline in capital expenditures working capital improvements of 87 million were from stronger accounts receivable collections in the past 12 months and a reduction in tax payments due to stock option exercises since august 31 2011 our accounts receivable balance has decreased by 10 million while organic asv is up 53 million over the same period reflecting an improvement in our dso from 35 to 32 days we have seen our dso decrease substantially over the past several years as we continued to optimize our internal billing and collection systems 

net cash used in investing activities was 588 million during fiscal 2012 due to the acquisition of streetaccount in june 2012 for 213 million net of cash acquired capital expenditures of 225 million and the purchase of 15 million of certificates of deposit with maturity dates ranging from nine to twelve months from purchase date net cash used in investing activities was 295 million higher in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to the acquisition of streetaccount and purchase of time deposits partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we relocated our new hampshire data center to a new facility in new jersey which resulted in our capital expenditures being higher in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2012 

net cash used in financing activities was 1587 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to 1991 million in the same period a year ago due to a reduction in share repurchases of 629 million partially offset by lower proceeds from employee stock plans a decrease in tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements and higher dividend payments based on a 15 increase in the regular quarterly dividend in fiscal 2012 we repurchased 16 million shares for 1527 million under the program in fiscal 2011 we repurchased 23 million shares for 2166 million proceeds from employee stock exercises decreased from 431 million in fiscal 2011 to 337 million in 2012 as the number of employee stock option exercises decreased by 05 million stock options through quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases we have returned 204 million to our stockholders over the past 12 months 

we expect that for at least the next 12 months our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of our cash as of august 31 2012 our total cash and cash equivalents was 1890 million with no outstanding borrowings we believe our liquidity including cash on hand cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate will be sufficient to meet our shortterm and longerterm operating requirements as they occur including working capital needs capital expenditures dividend payments stock repurchases and financing activities refer to the section contractual obligations for the table summarizing our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2012 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

our cash and cash equivalents decreased 141 million in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 as a result of cash outflows of 2166 million related to stock repurchases dividend payments of 439 million and capital expenditures of 293 partially offset by cash provided by operations of 2071 million 431 million from the exercise of employee stock options 183 million of tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements and 73 million from the effect of exchange rate changes on our foreign cash balances 

free cash flow of 178 million during fiscal 2011 was generated from net income higher noncash expenses and tax benefits from stock option exercises during the year resulting in lower income tax payments partially offset by increased capital expenditures and a decline in working capital from an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued compensation our accounts receivable balance net of reserves increased 153 million since august 31 2010 due to organic asv growth of 93 million in fiscal 2011 incremental outstanding receivables due from market metrics clients and the invoicing of a small percentage of our clients annually in advance during fiscal 2011 at august 31 2011 our dso was 35 days up from 31 days a year ago but down from 37 days at august 31 2009 accrued compensation decreased from 486 million at august 31 2010 to 415 million at august 31 2011 based on the timing of accrued payroll in the us 

 

  

  

net cash used in investing activities was 293 million in fiscal 2011 due to capital expenditures of 293 million of which 68 was for computer equipment including additional server equipment for our virginia and new jersey data centers and laptop computers and peripherals for our growing employee base the remaining 9 million or 32 of capital expenditures was for the build out of new space in paris and new york as well as the continued expansion of leased office space in india and the philippines 

net cash used in financing activities was 1991 in fiscal 2011 due to share repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by proceeds from employee stock plans during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 23 million shares for 2166 million under the program as compared to spending 193 million in fiscal 2010 higher dividend payments of 55 million were made in fiscal 2011 because our board of directors approved a 17 increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the company’s dividend payment in june 2011 proceeds from employee stock exercises decreased by 122 million because the number of employee stock option exercises decreased by 08 million stock options 

capital resources 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 225 million during fiscal 2012 down from 293 million a year ago capital spending levels were 68 million lower in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 as we relocated our data center from new hampshire to new jersey in december 2010 and in that process we purchased several new servers and upgraded many other existing mainframe machines approximately 131 million or 58 of capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 were for computer equipment including upgrading our mainframe server equipment held in our data centers and laptop computers and peripherals for our growing employee base the remaining 42 of capital expenditures was for office expansions primarily for the build out of new space in norwalk new york and hong kong as well as the continued expansion of leased office space in the philippines we continue to expand aggressively to meet the needs of our growing global footprint including new lease agreements entered into during fiscal 2012 our worldwide leased office space increased to approximately 807000 square feet at august 31 2012 up 11 from august 31 2011 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 were 293 million up from 208 million in fiscal 2010 approximately 192 million or 68 of capital expenditures were for computer equipment and the remainder for office expansions computer equipment purchases during fiscal 2011 included new equipment to fitout our data center in new jersey additional blade servers to increase the capacity and processing speed of our virginia and new jersey data centers and laptop computers for our growing employee base the remaining 88 million of capital expenditures were for the build out of space in paris and new york as well as the continued expansion of leased office space in india the philippines and japan 

capital needs 

we currently have no outstanding indebtedness other than the letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business approximately 43 million of standby letters of credit have been issued in connection with our current leased office space as of august 31 2012 these standby letters of credit contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios at august 31 2012 we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the standby letters of credit as of august 31 2012 and 2011 we maintained a zero debt balance and were in compliance with all covenants 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at august 31 2012 and 2011 we had no offbalance sheet financing or other arrangements with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities established for purposes of facilitating offbalance sheet financing or other debt arrangements or for other contractually limited purposes 

share repurchase program 

during fiscal 2012 we repurchased 16 million shares for 1527 million under the existing share repurchase program on may 8 2012 our board of directors approved a 200 million expansion of the existing share repurchase program including the expansion 1898 million remains authorized for future share repurchases at august 31 2012 repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations 

on june 13 2011 our board of directors approved an expansion of their existing share repurchase program by an additional 200 million during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 23 million shares for 2166 million under the program including the expansion 142 million remained authorized for future share repurchases as of august 31 2011 

 

  

  

  

contractual obligations 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2012 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

  

 

 

 

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations 

dividends 

on may 8 2012 our board of directors approved a 15 increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with our dividend payment on june 19 2012 of 031 per share or 124 per share per annum this is the seventh consecutive year that our annual dividend has been increased by more than 10 resulting in a five year annual dividend growth rate of 21 

during fiscal years 2012 and 2011 our board of directors declared the following dividends 

 

 

all of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources future cash dividends will depend on our earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors considered relevant by us and is subject to final determination by our board of directors 

 

  

  

  

significant accounting policies 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

critical accounting estimates 

  

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

revenue recognition and receivable reserves 

our revenues are derived from monthtomonth subscriptions to services such as workstations also referred to as users content and applications subscription revenue is earned each month as the service is rendered to clients on a monthly basis revenue is recognized when the client subscribes to factset services the service has been rendered and earned during the month the amount of the subscription is fixed or determinable based on established rates quoted on an annualized basis and collectability is reasonably assured 

accounts receivable are unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from clients located around the globe we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and do not require collateral we maintain reserves for potential writeoffs and these losses have historically been within expectations aged client receivables are analyzed each month and our collection efforts are directed accordingly we review recent history of client receivable writeoffs analyze trends in aged client receivables and general market conditions to estimate our accounts receivable reserve at august 31 2012 and 2011 the receivable reserve was 18 and 20 million respectively  

accrued compensation 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 1520 of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation as of august 31 2012 was 359 million compared 372 million as of august 31 2011 

business combinations 

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms our significant assumptions and estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and domestic production activities section 199 deductions our effective tax rate was 313 284 and 324 in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

 

  

  

we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest and related penalties if applicable on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements 

as of august 31 2012 we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 55 million including 10 million of accrued interest recorded as noncurrent taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements if recognized essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by lower earnings than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher earnings than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the postacquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

performancebased equity awards 

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which allows for the issuance of performancebased equity awards to employees accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performancebased equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest at the end of each reporting period management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels 

october 2009 annual employee performancebased option grant review 

in october 2009 we granted 900665 performancebased employee stock options 100 of these performancebased stock options are expected to vest because we achieved organic asv and diluted earnings per share growth of more than 10 on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended august 31 2011 this reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that will vest which required us to record an incremental 58 million of stockbased compensation during fiscal 2011 the 58 million of additional stockbased compensation represented the cumulative adjustment to change the vesting percentage from 60 to 100 as of august 31 2011 

november 2010 annual employee performancebased option grant review 

in november 2010 we granted 734334 performancebased employee stock options none of these performancebased stock options granted vested because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2012 this reflected a lower performance level than previously estimated and accordingly decreased the number of options that will vest to zero which required us to reverse 14 million of stockbased compensation during fiscal 2012 these performancebased options were recorded as forfeitures in fiscal 2012 

 

  

  

november 2011 annual employee performancebased option grant review 

in november 2011 we granted 665551 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that vest is based on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2013 at august 31 2012 we believed that it was not probable we would achieve the required asv and diluted earnings per share growth as our asv growth rate decelerated to 7 as such we estimated that none 0 of the performancebased stock options will vest however a change in the actual financial performance levels we achieve over the next 12 months could result in the following changes to our current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands 

 

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there had been a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2012 

july 2012 performancebased option grant review 

in july 2012 we granted 241546 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that vest is dependent upon future streetaccount user growth through august 31 2017 the five year performance measurement period is based on growing usage of factset and streetaccount at august 31 2012 we estimated that 20 or 48309 of the performancebased stock options will vest based on forecasted streetaccount growth which results in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 15 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period of approximately 30 years a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by us due to unforeseen significant streetaccount growth in future fiscal years could result in the following changes to our current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands 

 

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2012 

other performancebased stock options granted 

 

 

 amounts represent the cumulative catchup adjustment to be recorded if there was a change in the vesting percentage as of august 31 2012 

 

 

  

  

 

performancebased employee restricted stock units granted 

between june 2010 and july 2011 we granted 21102 restricted stock units which entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the awards vest over time a restricted stock unit is a promise to deliver shares to the employee at a future date if certain vesting conditions are met our restricted stock units are performancebased and cliff vest 25 when asv targets are achieved during a six year period restricted stock units are amortized to expense based on a gradedvesting attribution approach over the vesting period a change in the forecasted asv growth in fiscal 2013 could result in a change in the expected vesting period of these restricted stock units requiring us to accelerate the recognition of the remaining unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 01 million as of august 31 2012 

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2012 was 765 million 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

  

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information we determined that there were three reporting units during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 which are consistent with the operating segments reported   because there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment during fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 were us europe and asia pacific which reflects the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 and determined that there were no reporting units that were deemed at risk and there had been no impairment the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2012 and 2011 was 2458 million and 2283 million respectively 

we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset 

new accounting pronouncements

market trends 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations major equity indices  eg  dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp 500 and nasdaq composite continue to experience volatility approximately 81 of our annual subscription value is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

our investment banking clients who perform ma advisory work and equity research account for approximately 19 of our annual subscription value a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth 

  

we service equity research and ma departments these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of our clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments

financial risk management 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect operating results financial position and cash flows we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk through our regular operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge currency exposures as well as to reduce earnings volatility resulting from shifts in market rates we only enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposures our foreign currency market exposures include the euro british pound sterling japanese yen indian rupee and philippines peso the fair market values of all our derivative contracts change with fluctuations in currency rates and are designed so that any changes in their values are offset by changes in the values of the underlying exposures derivative financial instruments are held solely as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 

we are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet the level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding as well as fluctuations in the currency markets during the period the related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 

by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with a major financial institution further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties 

interest rate risk 

the fair market value of our cash and investments at august 31 2012 was 2030 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition and are reported at fair value our investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and as such are classified as investments shortterm on our consolidated balance sheet it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events current market events have not required us to modify materially or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk 

 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro japanese yen indian rupee and philippine peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 17 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 163 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 146 million per year to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency derivative financial instruments are held solely as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 

during fiscal 2012 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 90 of our indian rupee exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013 75 of our indian rupee exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and 50 of our indian rupee exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 additional foreign currency forward contracts were entered into to hedge approximately 50 of our net euro exposure through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2013 at august 31 2012 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase indian rupees with us dollars was 363 million and 24 million respectively at august 31 2012 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with us dollars were €81 million and 01 million respectively at august 31 2012 there were no other outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts a loss on derivatives for during fiscal 2012 of 10 million was recorded into operating income in our consolidated statements of income as compared to a gain of 42 million a year ago 

the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings 

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2012 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 41 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our expense base had we not had any hedges in place as of august 31 2012 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2012 would result in a decrease in operating income by 136 million over the next twelve months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2012 would increase the fair value of total assets by 298 million and equity by 272 million 

interest rate risk 

the fair market value of our cash and investments at august 31 2012 was 2030 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition and are reported at fair value our investments consist of certificates of deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year and as such are classified as investments shortterm on our consolidated balance sheet it is anticipated that the fair market value of our cash and investments will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by current market events

client support 

factset differentiates itself from others in the care and attention it provides to its users one of the company’s top priorities is to ensure that the user always has the most accurate data available and the support it needs to use factset most effectively whether it is a quick question or stepbystep guidance through a complex task factset consultants will help the client find answers and maximize the value of factset in addition to unlimited access to the global support desk every factset client is assigned a consultant who becomes familiar with the user’s needs and processes this knowledge enables the consultant to suggest innovative personal solutions consultants train users assist on projects and answer any questions the client may have 

the global financial information services industry 

over the past decade the industry in which factset operates in has transformed dramatically these changes include a significant increase in crossborder asset flows and global investment activity the evolution and maturation of electronic markets the proliferation of research information from a myriad of sources the increase in alternative strategies and the creation of increasingly complex security instruments 

all of these factors have created opportunities over the years for factset’s clients but they have also resulted in substantially increased complexity in their operations and processes factset believes that the global investment community has clear needs that translate into demand for factset’s solutions 

competition 

the market for providing accurate financial information and software solutions to the global investment community is highly competitive the global financial information services industry in which factset competes includes both large and wellcapitalized companies as well as smaller niche firms international and us competitors include market data suppliers news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply the company with financial information included in the factset workstation the main competitors and competitive products include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications such as thomson reuters inc bloomberg lp standard  poor’s including capital iq dealogic plc bond edge the yield book inc polypaths llc and wilshire associates incorporated many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those sold by the company 

despite the emergence of several competing market data products and services factset believes it has one of the broadest sets of functionalities an indicator of the company’s competitive position is that it has been able to introduce higher premiumbased pricing across its client base despite ongoing competition from larger vendors factset enjoys high barriers to entry and believes it would be difficult for another vendor to quickly replicate the extensive databases the company currently offers in addition factset’s applications supported by its client support and service offerings are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysisscreening capabilities they offer as a result the company’s products have become central to investment analysis and decisionmaking for clients while clients may add reduce or cancel services at any time switching costs may be high 

client relationships 

as of august 31 2011 there were over 48100 users of factset spread across 2237 clients in over 50 countries worldwide approximately 68 of fiscal 2011 revenues are from its client base in the us 25 in europe and the remaining 7 in asia pacific a significant part of the company’s strategy to maintain longterm client relationships involves both consulting services and client training clients are visited by company personnel for handson training and service the company’s help desk operates around the clock and sales and consulting personnel regularly visit clients to enhance support and the value of factset products factset’s consulting teams are designed to give clients a comprehensive understanding of the factset service offering no single client represented 10 or more of the company’s total revenues in any fiscal year presented 

recent market trends 

since the fall of 2008 the global equity indices have experienced significant volatility which has had an impact on the solvency size and buying power of some of factset’s clients and firms facing increasing pressure from regulators and investors to provide operational transparency despite this challenging climate factset has consistently grown quarterly revenues and the company anticipates continued volatility in the financial markets factset believes that these continued volatile market conditions increase the value of factset’s ability to consolidate services for clients including deploying realtime news and quotes and advancing the sales of proprietary content 

  

marketing 

beginning in 2009 factset initiated a global companywide effort to upgrade its clientbase to the new factset while increasing visibility of the new platform in all key markets fiscal 2011 was a strong year for promoting the factset brand from traditional advertising to client events to data sourcing factset’s signature cyan blue could be seen around the world in october 2010 factset unveiled the new tagline “perform or outperform your choice” which appeared in outdoor ads in new york frankfurt zurich london and a few other key areas 

the company has had success in many markets with outdoor advertising such as on taxis train platforms and elevator tvs the most important client events in fiscal 2011 were the two investment process symposiums factset’s symposiums grew from 60 participants in 2009 to almost 400 people this past year in fiscal 2011 factset partnered with dow jones completed a marketing deal with the associated press and continued the relationship with the wall street journal’s best on the street  factset hopes that by continuing to invest more in data sourcing these citations will become a driver of asv 

in addition the company drove consistency in messaging to its user base through enhanced marketing materials sharing insights on the factset website and by extending its web presence through social media outlets including facebook twitter and linkedin 

in fiscal 2012 and beyond factset plans to expand its brand presence along with media in newer markets 

client subscription growth 

annual subscription value “asv” at any given point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to clients at august 31 2011 asv was 779 million up 14 from a year ago of this total 82 of asv derives from investment management clients and the remainder from the sellside firms who perform ma advisory work and equity research the company’s 14 increase in asv during fiscal 2011 was driven by broadbased growth across its geographical segments clients continuing to license advanced applications such as portfolio analysis growth in the number of clients and users through the development of new functionality within factset the expanded deployment of proprietary data including factset fundamentals and estimates an increase in the client retention rate and returns from investing to grow the employee base

additional information 

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

 

   




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 

factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods 

risk factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset’s forwardlooking statements made by or on the company’s behalf include without limitation 

a decline in equity returns may impact the buying power of factset’s investment management clients 

major equity indices  eg  dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp 500 and nasdaq composite and the global economy have experienced increased levels of volatility approximately 82 of the company’s annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause factset to lose additional clients and users 

the global investment banking industry has been experiencing uncertainty consolidation and business failures since 2008 this consolidation has resulted in a reduction in the number of prospective clients and users within the investment banking sector factset’s sellside clients who perform ma advisory work and equity research account for approximately 18 of its revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the continued lack of available credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect the company’s financial results and future growth 

a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty may affect factset’s revenues and liquidity 

current global economic and financial market conditions and the potential for the prolongation of the global economic recession could adversely affect factset’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity the worldwide impact of market uncertainty including the recent european economic and financial uncertainty related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries could materially impact clients including large accounts causing them to go out of business entirely defer reduce or not increase the volume of the subscriptions they purchase from factset in the future or terminate existing relationships a variety of other uncontrollable and changing factors including inflationary pressures political or social unrest terrorist attacks uncertainty in the middle east and africa which could impact oil prices natural disasters in a specific country or region trade protection measures and health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic could have a material adverse effect on factset’s business and liquidity 

factset must continue to introduce new products and enhancements to maintain its technological position 

the market for factset is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards new technologies or industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis and the company’s new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements 

undetected errors or failures found in new products and product enhancements may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of the company’s products 

factset’s products may contain undetected errors or scalability limitations at any point but particularly when first introduced or as new versions are released despite significant testing by factset and by current and potential clients errors may not be found in new products until after release resulting in a loss of or a delay in market acceptance damage to the company’s reputation client dissatisfaction and reductions in revenues and margins any of which could seriously harm business 

  

factset’s ability to integrate and market factset proprietary data as a high quality asset 

the company offers proprietary datasets that include the latest most accurate information available wherever possible including fundamentals estimates ownership corporate new issues people private equity and venture capital mergers and acquisitions corporate events and transcripts fixed income global filings and benchmark data factset understands that data is part of a broader investment process so the company makes timeliness and reliability a priority in order to ensure accuracy timeliness and reliability of the data factset must continue to build on its content collection operations to populate the proprietary content databases as of august 31 2011 there were approximately 2800 employees in hyderabad and manila responsible for collecting data on thousands of global companies using a proprietary factset collection process this complex process involves hiring training and retaining thousands of employees and successfully deploying collection software and processes 

increased competition in factset’s industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products its competitors range in size from multibillion dollar companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors may offer price incentives to acquire new business competitive pricing pressures did not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations during fiscal 2011 or in any other fiscal year presented however future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions can also result in clients’ seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources 

the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services in recent years factset has seen clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors by selecting vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their needs for financial market data if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset the company’s results of operations could be adversely affected 

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

many of factset’s products as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation their misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of company security measures could expose factset its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company brand and reputation 

a prolonged or recurring outage at one of factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations however a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers and any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt factset’s operations 

despite factset’s implementation of network security measures its servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with the company’s computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on factset’s business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine the company’s own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm factset’s business operating results and financial condition to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations by clients factset’s business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

malicious ignorant or illegal employee acts regarding insider information 

misappropriation of insider information by an employee could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business improper disclosure of the company’s insider information could expose factset to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company’s brand and reputation 

factset’s ability to integrate newly acquired companies 

factset has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions from time to time acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into factset’s operations and there can be no assurances that factset will manage acquisitions successfully the related risks include the company’s failure to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business factset reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in its industry factset may be required to record a charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on its results of operations 

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing datasets or products 

factset is a provider of global financial and economic information on tens of thousands of companies worldwide clients have access to the data and content found within these databases which they can combine and utilize in nearly all of the company’s applications these databases are important to the company’s operations because they provide its clients with key information such as company fundamentals estimates global equity ownership ma data events and transcripts earnings and other equity and fixed income data factset aggregates thirdparty content from more than 85 data suppliers and over 100 news sources and exchanges the company integrates content from premier providers such as thomson standard  poor’s ftse interactive data corporation dow jones  company inc northfield information services inc barclays capital intex solutions inc bureau van dijk msci barra apt global insight inc morningstar inc lipper inc russell investments toyo keizai and six telekurs usa inc the company has entered into thirdparty content agreements with varying lengths from as long as five years to as short as on an adhoc basis the agreements in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates in other cases on shorter notice 

certain datasets that factset relies on have a limited number of suppliers although the company makes every effort to assure that where reasonable alternative sources are available these datasets include 1 equity pricing from exchanges such as nasdaq 2 global exchange indices 3 sp cusip distribution 4 sp ratings and 5 moody’s investor service corporate ratings however factset is not dependent on any one thirdparty data supplier in order to meet the needs of its clients the company combines the data from these commercial databases into its own dedicated single online service which the client accesses to perform their analysis the failure of factset to be able to maintain these relationships or the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of factset’s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 

factset’s success depends significantly upon its proprietary technology factset has registered trademarks and copyrights for many of its products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate factset generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees clients data suppliers and vendors the company seeks to protect its software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws while factset does not believe it is dependent on any one of its intellectual property rights the company does rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect its proprietary rights despite these efforts existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection in addition it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of factset content or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use its proprietary information in addition factset cannot be certain that others will not develop or acquire substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology or that equivalent or better products will not be marketed in competition with its services thereby substantially reducing the value of its proprietary rights 

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights 

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms enter into settlements require factset to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients or vendors under contractual provisions of various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue incurring expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

  

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows 

the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because 67 of factset’s employees and 45 of its leased office space are located outside the us these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial results and cash flows the company’s primary exposures relate to nonus dollar denominated expenses within europe japan india and the philippines this exposure has increased over the past twelve months primarily because the company’s international employee base rose 33 since august 31 2010 the financial statements of the company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses factset’s nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 16 million while its nonus dollar denominated expenses are 165 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 149 million per year to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations the company utilizes derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts although factset believes that its foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances the company’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on its results of operations 

risks of doing business internationally 

during fiscal 2011 approximately 315 of the company’s revenue was generated outside the us as of august 31 2011 the company employed 3538 employees outside the us representing 67 of the employee headcount worldwide and a 33 increase in the last twelve months because factset sells its services outside the us the company is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations including the impact of recessions and market fluctuations adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates difficulty in the enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements difficulties in successfully adapting the company’s products and services to the language regulatory and technology standards of other countries resistance of local cultures to foreignbased companies and difficulties engaging local resources inflation natural disasters in developing countries and political and economic instability 

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

the company’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for talent including engineering personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships factset’s failure to attract and retain talented employees could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

factset is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes tax liability or effective tax rates in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before income taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its provision for income taxes and tax liability 

catastrophic events could adversely affect factset’s business 

catastrophic events such as abrupt political change terrorist acts conflicts or wars may cause damage or disruption to the economy financial markets and factset’s clients the potential for future attacks the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security and other actual or potential conflicts wars or political unrest have created many economic and political uncertainties although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events they could unsettle the financial markets or result in a decline in the financial industry’s spending which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues further such disruptions could cause further instability in the financial markets or the spending of factset’s clients and prospects upon which the company depends on 

  

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset’s operating results 

factset is party to lawsuits in the normal course of business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding legal matters see item 3 legal proceedings  contained in part i of this report 

changes in securities laws and regulations may increase expenses or may harm demand 

many of factset’s clients operate within a highly regulated environment in light of the recent conditions in the us financial markets and economy congress and regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry the information provided by or resident in the service factset provides to its clients could be deemed relevant to a regulatory investigation or other governmental or private legal proceeding involving its clients which could result in requests for information from factset that could be expensive and time consuming in addition clients subject to investigations or legal proceedings may be adversely impacted possibly leading to their liquidation bankruptcy receivership reductions in assets under management or diminished operations that would adversely affect the company’s revenues 

the recently enacted doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the us establishes the new federal bureau of consumer financial protection the “bcfp” and will require the bcfp and other federal agencies to implement many new rules while the general framework of the reforms is set forth in the doddfrank act it provides for numerous studies and reports and the adoption and implementation of rules and regulations by regulatory agencies over the next four years to clarify and implement the act’s requirements fully factset believes that it is too early to know the precise longterm impact on its business of the increased regulation of financial institutions demand could be negatively impacted by the deferral of purchase decisions by its clients until the new regulations have been adopted and the full impact and expense of the new regulatory environment is more clearly understood the doddfrank act contains numerous other provisions affecting financial institutions of all types many of which may have an impact on factset’s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways accordingly it is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the doddfrank act and the forthcoming implementing rules and regulations will have on the company and the financial services industry additionally as a publiclytraded company factset is subject to significant regulations including the doddfrank act and the sarbanesoxley act “the sarbanesoxley act” of 2002 there are significant corporate governance and executive compensationrelated provisions in the doddfrank act that require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas factset’s efforts to comply with these requirements could result in an increase in its operating and compliance costs 

changes in accounting may affect factset’s reported earnings and operating income 

factset prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles and accompanying accounting standards implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of its business are highly complex and involve judgments changes in accounting rules their interpretation or changes in the company’s business could significantly change its reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures without a comparable underlying change in cash flows from operations in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements factset uses certain estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and management’s knowledge of current events and actions that factset may undertake in the future significant estimates have been made in areas that include income taxes useful lives of fixed assets and intangibles accrued compensation stockbased compensation and allocation of purchase price to assets and liabilities acquired in addition factset makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion and therefore actual results may differ 

internal controls may be ineffective 

effective internal controls are necessary to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 factset is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in its implementation its business and operating results could be adversely impacted

 revenues 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

revenues in fiscal 2011 were 7265 million up 133 from 6411 million for the same period a year ago increased revenues were from successes across our product suite and in all geographic locations the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 was a record quarter for us as asv grew by 37 million rising to 779 million at august 31 2011 during fiscal 2011 our user count increased by 5300 net new clients rose to 127 and annual subscriptions increased by 93 million organically broadbased growth has been the catalyst for accelerating our asv growth rate to 14 over the past 12 months our investment management clients continue to experience strong growth across all geographies and represented 82 of our total revenues in fiscal 2011 consistent with the prior year for much of fiscal 2011 the global financial markets were in positive territory thus encouraging many of our clients to invest in people and in their business partnerships this generally positive business environment coupled with our strategy of continual product and service enhancements translated into progress in each of our key metrics the new factset application released in september 2009 continues to receive strong reviews from the marketplace we invested heavily in the product during fiscal 2011 releasing four new versions each with many new features and improvements in speed and stability our client product usage growth rate far exceeded our subscription growth rate signaling that we delivered more value per dollar of subscription to our clients than in prior years 

despite the emergence of several competing market data products and services we believe we have one of the broadest sets of functionalities an indicator of our competitive position is that we have been able to introduce price increases across our client base despite ongoing competition from larger vendors in addition factset applications supported by our client support and service offerings are entrenched in the workflow of many financial professionals given the downloading functions and portfolio analysisscreening capabilities they offer 

our revenue growth drivers during fiscal 2011 were broadbased growth across our geographical segments clients continued use of our advanced applications such as portfolio analysis growth in the number of clients and users new functionality within factset that improves our clients’ workflows by consolidating multiple services into one platform the expanded deployment of our proprietary data 17 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of market metrics on june 1 2010 an increase in the client retention rate and annual price increases 

broadbased growth across all geographies 

our sales and consulting staff continued to sell our broad range of products across each geographic region we gained new clients at traditional money managers regional broker dealers and among research and sales departments both in the us and internationally improving market stability during fiscal 2011 resulted in a business environment favorable to our us investment management clients as they continued to experience strong growth across all geographies as a result our client and user counts expanded to record highs across all geographies 

clients continue to license our advanced applications 

equity portfolio analysis spar fixed income in pa and quantitative tools have been among the many valueadded applications that continue to be in demand by our clients as sales of our quantitative products accelerated and led to revenue growth in fiscal 2011 this suite is comprehensive and includes the applications for portfolio attribution risk quantitative analysis portfolio publishing and returns based style analysis beginning in fiscal 2011 the expanded pa suite included axioma models and our single name security exposures application this expanded pa suite of products registered its best quarterly performance of the fiscal year during the third quarter as we continue to increase the pa workstation count the number of clients using fixed income in pa and the number of quantitative users who take advantage of our pa offerings 

  

growth in the number of clients and users of factset 

we experienced net new client growth each quarter during fiscal 2011 as we continue to provide users with improved features and functionality within virtually every report and chart on factset our client count expanded with 127 net new clients and 5300 net new users in the past 12 months at august 31 2011 client count was 2237 a net increase of 50 clients during the past three months professionals using factset increased to 48100 as of august 31 2011 up 2500 users in the last three months and up 5300 users since the beginning of the year at august 31 2011 the average asv per client was 348000 up from 324000 at august 31 2010 and 305000 at august 31 2009 gaining new clients and users enables us to begin a cycle of introducing them to our suite of products so that we can then show users our valueadded applications and content in future periods user count growth of 12 over the past 12 months was derived from both investment management and global banking and brokerage clients 

new functionality within factset that improves our clients’ workflows and consolidate multiple services onto one platform 

factset consolidates data and analytics previously spread across multiple applications onto one comprehensive intuitive interface improving both functionality and ease of use we continue to receive positive feedback on our user interface and believe that we are deepening the engagement level of thousands of users as our broad range of content and functionality is readily accessible through the user interface realtime news and quotes is a product that services the needs of a global investor and continues to be a source of revenue growth for us realtime users have increased every quarter since the product was released in 2002 deployment of realtime news and quotes has resulted in a significant increase in user count over the last 12 months in addition the ability for our end users to access more than 85 premium thirdparty content providers and integrate their own data for use in factset applications continues to support revenue growth we continue to appeal to larger institutions because of our ability to service many different user groups and our ability to deliver intensive computing power and analytics to end users 

expanded deployment of our proprietary data 

we are pleased by the growing returns from our investment in proprietary content as we continue to make timeliness and reliability of data one of our top priorities in fiscal 2011 factset fundamentals was enhanced to deliver high quality standardized data within hours of public filings by us companies factset fundamentals and factset estimates have been strong performers and we continue to invest in those and in our other proprietary databases such as factset economics corporate events and transcripts and ownership we offer proprietary datasets that generally include the latest most accurate information available such as fundamentals estimates ownership corporate events and transcripts corporate new issues people private equity and venture capital mergers and acquisitions fixed income global filings and benchmark data 

incremental revenue from market metrics 

on june 1 2010 we acquired market metrics a market research firm in the us focused on advisorsold investments and insurance products during fiscal 2011 market metrics added 17 million of revenue to our operations primarily from its core business and the introduction of a new local market survey product which enabled fund managers to understand the value and penetration of their own products in local markets in greater detail than they have been able to examine before 

increase in the client retention rate 

at august 31 2011 our annual client retention remained at greater than 95 of asv consistent with last year however on a client basis our annual client retention rate improved to 92 of clients at august 31 2011 as compared to 90 a year ago this improvement suggests that despite concerns over the global economy our clients are using and purchasing factset services as they continue to derive value from them 

annual price increases 

in january 2011 we implemented an annual price increase for the majority of our us investment management clients and a smaller percentage of our us global banking and brokerage business this price increase resulted in asv growth during fiscal 2011 of 9 million as compared to the prior year price increase of 77 million in addition in march 2011 we rolled out an annual price increase for our nonus investment management clients which increased asv by 20 million as compared to the prior year price increase which added 13 million in asv 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

revenues in fiscal 2010 were 6411 million up 31 from 6220 million for the same period a year ago we delivered solid growth across a range of product areas and geographic regions during fiscal 2010 our user count increased by 5500 net new clients rose by 65 and annual subscriptions increased by 61 million broadbased growth was the catalyst for accelerating our organic asv growth rate to 7 in fiscal 2010 we focused on promoting the new factset workstation and upgrading existing clients to this more intuitive easier to use platform we have gained new clients at traditional money managers regional broker dealers and among research and sales departments both in the us and internationally as new and existing clients continue to value our functionality and content 

  

positive revenue drivers during fiscal 2010 were the expanded deployment of our proprietary data across all geographies including incremental subscriptions to factset fundamentals and estimates the continued development of new functionality within factset that improves our clients’ processes our ability to consolidate multiple services into one through the factset platform enabling our clients to recognize efficiencies in many instances clients continuing to license our advanced applications such as portfolio analysis an annual price increase for our investment management clients 39 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of market metrics on june 1 2010 and a meaningful reduction in the number of client cancels 

partially offsetting the positive revenue drivers discussed above were continued client consolidations firm failures and sellside companies that scaled back expenditures in the first half of fiscal 2010 emphasizing savings over spending during the first six months of fiscal 2010 the sales environment was challenging for us as our sellside clients made changes to stabilize themselves several of our largest banking clients ceased operations as employment contracted across most of the industry resulting in a 09 million decrease in our sellside asv through the first six months of fiscal 2010 

revenues by geographic region 

 

 revenues from our us segment increased to 4976 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 4354 million in the same period a year ago our revenue growth rate in the us reflects strong client and user growth the expanded deployment of our proprietary content our realtime news and quotes capabilities incremental revenues from market metrics a reduction in client cancellations our annual price increase and expanding the number of pa users the annual price increase for our us investment management and banking and brokerage clients in january 2011 drove revenues up by approximately 6 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to 5 million in fiscal 2010 excluding the acquisition of market metrics on june 1 2010 us revenues grew 113 in fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period a year ago 

international revenues in fiscal 2011 were 2289 million an increase from 2057 million in the prior year period the impact from foreign currency increased international revenues by 14 million year over year european revenues advanced to 1787 million due to increases in user and client counts offering a broader selection of global proprietary content clients licensing our advanced applications and growth in our realtime news and quotes asia pacific revenues grew to 503 million up from 441 million a year ago the foreign currency impact attributable to the change in the value of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar increased revenues by 14 million in fiscal 2011 holding currencies constant asia pacific revenue growth year over year was 109 largely due to our ability to sell additional services to existing clients the ability to bring on new clients and users over the last 12 months growth in our global content offering and the expansion of our realtime news and quotes revenues from international operations accounted for 315 of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2011 as compared to 321 in the year ago quarter 

during fiscal 2010 us revenues increased 27 while international revenues increased 38 compared to fiscal 2009 the impact from foreign currency reduced international revenues by 09 million in fiscal 2010 european revenues advanced 32 to 1616 million and asia pacific revenues grew to 441 million up 62 from fiscal 2009 our revenue growth rates in fiscal 2010 reflect modest client and user growth our realtime news and quotes capabilities included in the new factset and the expanded deployment of our proprietary partially offset by client consolidations firm failures and sellside companies that scaled back expenditures in the first half of fiscal 2010 

annual subscription value asv 

asv at a given point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next 12 months from all subscription services being supplied to our clients with proper notice to us our clients are generally able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time at august 31 2011 asv was 779 million up 14 from a year ago of this total 82 of asv is derived from investment management clients and the remainder from the sellside firms who perform ma advisory work and equity research asv from our us operations was 533 million an increase of 67 million during fiscal 2011 asv from international operations increased to 246 million at august 31 2011 representing 32 of the companywide total asv growth of 14 in fiscal 2011 was driven by purchases of advanced applications growth in the number of clients and users the expanded deployment of proprietary data an increase in the client retention rate asv growth in the market 

  

metrics business and an annual price increase for our clients we believe that our continued asv growth at healthy levels highlights the stability of our subscription business model and the improving health of a global client base we continue to combine our analytic applications premier global content and client service to foster growth and the expansion of our business for the seventh consecutive quarter since the recent economic downturn we had asv and user growth in both buyside and sellside clients as noted earlier in january 2011 we implemented an annual price increase for the majority of our us investment management clients and a smaller percentage of our us global banking and brokerage business this price increase resulted in asv growth during fiscal 2011 of 9 million as compared to the prior year price increase of 77 million in addition in march 2011 we rolled out an annual price increase for our nonus investment management clients which increased asv by 20 million as compared to the prior year price increase of 13 million 

excluding 16 million from the acquisition of market metrics and 1 million from the impact of foreign currency asv increased 7 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 drivers of asv growth in fiscal 2010 were existing clients continuing to order additional factset proprietary content portfolio analytics the expansion of user count within our global banking and brokerage clients the increased commitment of our investment management clients and a 9 million annual price increase for our investment management clients worldwide with the financial industry’ recovering from the market lows of 2009 and most major stock indices exhibiting signs of stability our clients entered 2010 with more optimism and were looking for ways to improve their investment process this improved mindset coupled with our strategy of continual product and service enhancement translated into positive asv growth in fiscal 2010 

users and clients 

at august 31 2011 professionals using factset increased to 48100 up 5300 users from the beginning of the year client count was 2237 as of august 31 2011 a net increase of 127 clients during fiscal 2011 at august 31 2011 the average asv per client was 348000 up from 324000 at august 31 2010 and 305000 at august 31 2009 as of august 31 2011 our largest individual client accounted for 2 of total asv subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 16 of total asv as of august 31 2011 consistent with august 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

our client count expanded by 127 net new clients during fiscal 2011 as we saw fewer cancellations and more new clients the decline in cancellations is directly correlated to a decrease in firm closures we’ve experienced healthy user and client growth in all geographic segments as well as in both investment management and investment banking advances in our realtime offering and credit analysis are improving our penetration in investment management clients sellside firms increased the number of new junior bankers due to higher ma volumes and a stronger ipo environment over the past 12 months 

operating expenses 

 

  

 cost of services 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for the twelve months ended august 31 2011 cost of services increased 18 to 2446 million as compared to 2066 million in the same period a year ago cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues was 337 during fiscal 2011 an increase of 150 basis points from fiscal 2010 the increase year over year was driven by higher employee compensation including performancebased stock option expense partially offset by lower levels of third party data costs computerrelated expenses and communication costs 

  

employee compensation including stockbased compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 330 basis points for the twelve months ended august 31 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 due to the continued expansion of our proprietary content collection operations in hyderabad and manila the hiring of new classes of software engineers and consultants around the world increased variable compensation and higher stockbased compensation expense over the last 12 months we have increased our content collection headcount by approximately 729 employees primarily at our facilities in india and the philippines at august 31 2011 approximately 54 of our employees were involved with content collection as compared to 51 a year ago in addition to the hiring of people for our content collection operations we hired over 140 net new software engineers and 180 net new consultants in fiscal 2011 as we continue to improve our applications and service our existing client base stockbased compensation recorded within cost of services was up 32 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to a year ago due to performancebased stock options as disclosed earlier an incremental 79 million of stockbased compensation was recorded in fiscal 2011 related to an increase in the estimated number of performancebased options that will vest the revised estimate reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of performancebased options that will vest and be expensed approximately 19 million of the total pretax charge of 79 million was recorded within cost of services and the remaining 60 million within selling general and administrative expenses 

lower third party data costs computerrelated expenses and communication costs partially offset the overall increase in cost of services during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 third party data costs expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 80 basis points for the twelve months ended august 31 2011 compared to the same period in fiscal 2010 due to a reduction in data expense associated with the end of the thomson reuters transition services agreement and the increased focus on collecting more proprietary content which is recorded as employee compensation as opposed to paying for third party data content annual thirdparty royalty payments were reduced by 17 million in fiscal 2011 computerrelated expenses including depreciation and computer maintenance costs decreased 70 basis points expressed as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2011 as compared to a year ago due to the transition to more efficient and costeffective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers the cost per server and related architecture continues to decline as technological advances continue to be made in servers and other related computer equipment used in our data centers communication costs expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to implementing more cost effective means to connect clients to our data centers 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

cost of services decreased 1 to 2066 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to 2094 million in the same period a year ago cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues was 322 during fiscal 2010 a decline of 145 basis points from fiscal 2009 the decrease year over year was driven by lower levels of third party data costs and a reduction in data vendor royalty payments partially offset by higher employee compensation 

data costs expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 210 basis points for the twelve months ended august 31 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 lower external collection costs were the result of a reduction in data amortization expense associated with the thomson reuters transition services agreement and the termination of a business process outsourcing relationship in may 2009 annual thirdparty royalty payments were reduced by 61 million in fiscal 2010 due to a reduction in purchases of third party data content 

partially offsetting the decrease in cost of services during fiscal 2010 was an increase in employee compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues employee compensation increased 70 basis points during the twelve months ended august 31 2010 due to expanding the number of employees in our offshore proprietary content collection operations and increased variable compensation during fiscal 2010 we increased our data collection headcount by over 900 employees primarily at our offshore facilities in india and the philippines 

selling general and administrative

the rise in sga expenses year over year was partially offset as we recorded a gain on derivatives of 42 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to a gain of 08 million a year ago from foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our euro and british pound sterling currency risk we hedged approximately 95 of our fiscal 2011 exposure to movements in the euro and british pound sterling against the us dollar during the 2010 calendar year since the date the forward contracts were entered into during 2010 the us dollar weakened against both the euro and british pound sterling marketing costs expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 10 basis points in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to the prior year launch of the new factset and the related costs to market the new release

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

operating income from our us segment increased 8 to 1353 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 1250 million a year ago the increase in operating income was primarily due to 622 million of incremental revenues and lower data and computerrelated expenses partially offset by higher employee compensation including incremental performancebased stock option expense and a rise in our te spend our revenue growth in the us reflects client and user growth incremental revenues from market metrics expanding the number of pa users and an increase in the client retention rate variable fees payable to data vendors based on deployment of their content over the factset platform declined as the result of increased client usage of our proprietary content including factset fundamentals factset estimates and factset economics computerrelated expenses including depreciation and computer maintenance costs decreased due to the transition to more efficient and costeffective servers in our data centers in addition to the continued use of fully depreciated servers the increase in employee compensation is due to an 18 headcount growth in the us and higher stockbased compensation expense to reflect the incremental charge from performancebased stock options 

european operating income increased 10 to 796 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 722 million in the same period a year ago the 10 growth in european operating income was due to a 170 million increase in revenues and lower variable fees payable to data vendors partially offset by higher te expenses the increase in european revenues was due to increases in user and client counts a broader offering of global proprietary content increased licenses to clients for our advanced applications and growth in our realtime news and quotes european te expenses rose primarily due to a 25 increase in airline ticketing fees and hotel stays in order to visit more clients as well as more trips to our data content collection operations in india and the philippines 

asia pacific operating income decreased 4 to 234 million during fiscal 2011 compared to 244 million a year ago the decrease in asia pacific operating income was primarily driven by higher employee compensation due to headcount growth increased occupancy costs from our office expansions in japan and hong kong and higher te expense partially offset by 62 million of incremental revenues year over year the increase in asia pacific employee compensation was from a 19 increase in headcount in our sales offices location in hong kong tokyo mumbai and sydney

 other income 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

other income during fiscal 2011 was consistent with fiscal 2010 levels as the federal reserve maintained low us interest rates which kept returns on our cash and cash equivalents low other income was 06 million for the twelve months ended august 31 2011 compared to 05 million in the same period a year ago our average annualized return on cash and cash equivalents was 37 basis points during fiscal 2011 as compared to 20 basis points in fiscal 2010 at no time during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 did a component of our cash and cash equivalents portfolio experience a decline in value due to a ratings change default or increase in counterparty credit risk 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

other income declined 50 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as the result of the federal reserve lowering us interest rates by more than 200 basis points in 2010 

income taxes 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

during fiscal 2011 the provision for income taxes decreased 6 to 679 million as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to income tax benefits of 6 million from the finalization of the fiscal 2010 tax return and the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit in december 2010 partially offset by an 8 increase in income before income taxes our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 before discrete items of 6 million was 309 200 basis points lower than our annual effective tax rate before discrete items of 329 in fiscal 2010 the decrease year over year was primarily due to higher levels of nonus taxable income increased rd activity which increased our related rd tax credit and a rise in our domestic production activities section 199 deduction 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2010 the provision for income taxes increased 7 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to the lapse of the us federal rd tax credit and higher levels of pretax income partially offset by income tax benefits of 13 million during fiscal 2010 we recorded income tax benefits of 13 million associated with the finalization of our fiscal 2009 tax return adjustments to certain reserves to reflect the lapse of statute of limitations and higher levels of nonus taxable income our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 before discrete items of 13 million was 70 basis points lower than the fiscal 2009 effective tax rate of 336 due to increased nonus income and a higher section 199 deduction 

net income and earnings per share

net income rose 14 to 1710 million and diluted earnings per share increased 15 to 361 in fiscal 2011 compared to a year ago included in fiscal 2011 were income tax benefits of 013 per diluted share from finalizing our 2010 us tax return and the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit drivers of net income and diluted earnings per share growth were higher levels of revenue lower data costs decreased computerrelated expenses a lower effective tax rate and a reduction in the diluted weighted average shares outstanding partially offset by higher compensation including incremental performancebased stock option expense and additional te spend it remains our philosophy to expand over the longterm by investing in our employees to retain our position as a premium provider of financial information and analytical tools 

  

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

net income advanced 1502 million up 4 while diluted earnings per common share rose 5 to 313 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 included in fiscal 2010 were income tax benefits of 003 per diluted share from finalizing our us tax return for 2009 adjusting certain reserves to reflect the lapse of statute of limitations and higher levels of nonus taxable income excluding the income tax benefits of 003 per diluted share in fiscal 2010 and 009 per diluted share in fiscal 2009 our diluted earnings per share grew 7 year over year primarily due a 3 increase in revenues lower data costs and favorable currency rates partially offset by higher compensation expense 

foreign currency 

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income as a component of stockholders’ equity transaction gains and losses that arise from the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in determining net income for the period in which exchange rates change 

our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 16 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 165 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 149 million per year our primary foreign currency exchange exposures are related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where approximately 67 of our employees are located foreign currency movements increased our operating expenses by 15 million and decreased operating income by 01 million during fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2010 operating expenses were reduced by 38 million and operating income increased by 47 million from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 

to reduce variability from foreign currency fluctuations in operating expenses denominated in british pound sterling euro and japanese yen we entered into foreign currency forward contracts during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 95 of our net japanese yen exposure through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 in the second half of fiscal 2010 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 95 of our net euro exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and 95 of our net british pound sterling exposure through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 in designing a specific hedging approach we considered several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures forecasting risk and potential ineffectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings 

at august 31 2011 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase japanese yen with us dollars were ¥165 million and less than 01 million respectively at august 31 2011 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with us dollars were €65 million and 09 million respectively at august 31 2011 there were no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase british pound sterling with us dollars a gain on derivatives of 42 million was recorded into operating income during fiscal 2011 compared to a gain of 08 million in the same period a year ago

cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 1817 million or 28 of our total assets at august 31 2011 compared with 1957 million or 30 of our total assets at august 31 2010 all of our operating and capital expense requirements were financed entirely from cash generated from our operations our cash and cash equivalents decreased 141 million during fiscal 2011 as a result of cash outflows of 2166 million related to stock repurchases dividend payments of 439 million and capital expenditures of 293 million partially offset by cash provided by operations of 2071 million 431 million from the exercise of employee stock options 183 million of tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements and 73 million from the effect of exchange rate changes on our foreign cash balances 

free cash flow generated during fiscal 2011 was 178 million and exceeded net income by 4 in each of the past three years our business model has generated free cash in excess of net income and has average 184 million per year free cash flow in fiscal 2011 was driven by record levels of net income higher noncash expenses and tax benefits from stock option exercises during the year resulting in lower income tax payments partially offset by increased capital expenditures and a decline in working capital from an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued compensation 

our accounts receivable balance net of reserves increased 153 million since august 31 2010 due to organic asv growth of 93 million in fiscal 2011 incremental outstanding receivables due from market metrics clients and the invoicing of a small percentage of our clients annually in advance during fiscal 2011 at august 31 2011 our days sales outstanding “dso” was 35 days up from 31 days a year ago but down from 37 days at august 31 2009 we have seen dsos remain low over the past several years as a result of our highly motivated collection and information systems teams accrued compensation decreased from 486 million at august 31 2010 to 415 million at august 31 2011 based on the timing of accrued payroll in the us 

in addition during fiscal 2011 we remitted estimated tax payments totaling 369 million as compared to 385 million in fiscal 2010 as the result of higher tax benefits from stock option exercises year over year

net cash used in financing activities was 476 million higher in fiscal 2011 as compared to the same period a year ago due to incremental share repurchases and higher dividend payments partially offset by lower proceeds from employee stock plans during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 23 million shares for 217 million under the program as compared to spending 193 million in share repurchases a year ago higher dividend payments of 55 million were made in fiscal 2011 because our board of directors approved a 17 increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with the company’s dividend payment in june 2011 proceeds from employee stock exercises decreased from 553 million in fiscal 2010 to 431 million in 2011 as the number of employee stock option exercises decreased by 771196 stock options through quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases we have returned 261 million to our stockholders over the past 12 months 

we expect our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow our liquidity is a function of our ability to generate cash flows from a combination of efficient operations as of august 31 2011 our total cash and cash equivalents was 1817 million with no outstanding borrowings we believe our liquidity including cash on hand cash from operating activities and other cash flows that we expect to generate will be sufficient to meet our shortterm and longerterm operating requirements as they occur including working capital needs capital expenditures dividend payments stock

free cash flow of 190 million during fiscal 2010 was generated from high levels of net income positive working capital changes and a reduction in capital expenditures the improvement in working capital of 40 million during fiscal 2010 resulted primarily from tax benefits from stock option exercises during the year resulting in lower income tax payments and a 5 decrease in accounts receivable 

net cash used in investing activities increased to 759 million in fiscal 2010 due to 552 million of net cash paid to acquire the market metrics business on june 1 2010 and 208 million of capital expenditures of which 65 were for computer equipments and the remainder covered office space expansion in new york india and the philippines fiscal 2009 included 253 million of net proceeds from the sale of investments as we shifted from fixed income government securities to money market funds

contractual obligations 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2011 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

  

   purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations 

expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations 

share repurchase program 

on june 13 2011 our board of directors approved an expansion of the existing share repurchase program by an additional 200 million during fiscal 2011 we repurchased 23 million shares for 217 million under the program including the expansion 142 million remains authorized for future share repurchases as of august 31 2011 repurchases will be made 

  

from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations

 all of the above cash dividends were paid from existing cash resources future cash dividends will depend on the company’s earnings capital requirements financial condition and other factors considered relevant by us and is subject to final determination by our board of directors 

significant accounting policies 

we describe our significant accounting policies in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 below 

critical accounting estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are derived from monthtomonth subscriptions to services such as workstations also referred to as users content and applications subscription revenue is earned each month as the service is rendered to clients on a monthly basis revenue is recognized when the client subscribes to factset services the service has been rendered and earned during the month the amount of the subscription is fixed and determinable based on established rates quoted on an annualized basis and collectability is reasonably assured 

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2011 was 816 million 

  

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information we determined that there were three reporting units during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 which are consistent with the operating segments reported because there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 were us europe and asia pacific which reflects the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 and determined that there were no reporting units that were deemed at risk and there had been no impairment the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2011 was 2283 million 

we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset 

accrued compensation 

we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 1520 of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation as of august 31 2011 was 372 million 

performancebased equity awards 

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which allows for the issuance of performancebased equity awards to employees accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all performancebased equity awards made to employees based on the estimated fair values of the awards that are expected to vest at the end of each reporting period management must make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets because the number of stock options that vest will be predicated on us achieving these levels 

august 2007 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2007 we granted 896194 performancebased employee stock options none of these performancebased stock options granted vested because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2009 these performancebased options were recorded as forfeitures in august 2009 

  

august 2008 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2008 we granted 1058981 performancebased employee stock options none of these performancebased stock options granted vested because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2010 these performancebased options were recorded as forfeitures in august 2010 

october 2009 annual employee performancebased option grant review 

in october 2009 we granted 900665 performancebased employee stock options 100 of these performancebased stock options are expected to vest because we achieved organic asv and diluted earnings per share growth of more than 10 on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended august 31 2011 this reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that will vest which required us to record an incremental 58 million of stockbased compensation during fiscal 2011 the amount of additional stockbased compensation represented the cumulative adjustment to change the vesting percentage to 100 as of august 31 2011 

november 2010 annual employee performancebased option grant review 

in november 2010 we granted 734334 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that will vest is based on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2012 at august 31 2011 the company estimated that 20 or 146867 of the performancebased stock options will vest which results in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 23 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period a change in the actual financial performance levels we achieve could result in the following changes to our current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands 

 

  

 other performancebased stock options granted 

between june 2010 and july 2011 we granted 978173 performancebased employee stock options that vest based on us achieving certain asv targets over a six year period if 100 of the 978173 performancebased stock options granted were to vest due to unforeseen significant asv growth in future fiscal years we would incur an incremental 162 million of stockbased compensation over the vesting period however as of august 31 2011 we expect that only 204933 of the total 978173 performancebased stock options will vest and be expensed resulting in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 21 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period 

other performancebased employee restricted stock units granted 

between june 2010 and july 2011 we granted 21102 restricted stock units which entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the awards vest over time a restricted stock unit is a promise to deliver shares to the employee at a future date if certain vesting conditions are met our restricted stock units are performancebased and cliff vest 25 when serviced asv targets are achieved during a six year period restricted stock units are amortized to expense based on a gradedvesting attribution approach over the vesting period a change in the forecasted asv growth in future fiscal years could result in a change in the expected vesting period of these restricted stock units requiring us to accelerate the recognition of the remaining unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 06 million as of august 31 2011 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and domestic production activities section 199 deductions our effective tax rate was 284 324 and 317 in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest and related penalties if applicable on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements 

as of august 31 2011 we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 72 million including 09 million of accrued interest recorded as noncurrent taxes payable in the consolidated statement of financial condition unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements if recognized essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by lower earnings than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher earnings than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the postacquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption which we include here by reference 

market trends 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations major equity indices  eg  dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp 500 and nasdaq composite continue to experience volatility approximately 82 of our annual subscription value is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

our sellside clients who perform ma advisory work and equity research account for approximately 18 of our annual subscription value a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the credit crisis that began in august 2007 continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients could encounter similar problems a lack of confidence in the global banking system could cause declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth 

we service equity research and ma departments these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of our clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments

 financial risk management 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect operating results financial position and cash flows we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk through our regular operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge currency exposures as well as to reduce earnings volatility resulting from shifts in market rates we only enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposures our primary foreign currency market exposures include the euro british pound sterling japanese yen indian rupee and philippines peso the 

  

fair market values of all our derivative contracts change with fluctuations in currency rates and are designed so that any changes in their values are offset by changes in the values of the underlying exposures derivative financial instruments are held solely as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 

we are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet the level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding as well as fluctuations in the currency markets during the period the related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 

by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with two major financial institutions further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties 

interest rate risk 

the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents at august 31 2011 was 182 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition and are reported at fair value it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents have been significantly impacted by current market events including the recent credit crisis 

current market events have not required us to modify materially or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro japanese yen indian rupee and philippines peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 16 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 165 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 149 million per year to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency derivative financial instruments are held solely as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 95 of our net japanese yen exposure through the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 in the second half of fiscal 2010 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 95 of our net euro exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and 95 of our net british pound sterling exposure through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings 

at august 31 2011 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase japanese yen with us dollars were ¥165 million and less than 01 million respectively at august 31 2011 the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with us dollars were €65 million and 09 million respectively there were no outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase british pound sterling with us dollars as of august 31 2011 

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2011 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased by 20 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by changes in our euro and japanese yen expense base had we not had any hedges in place as of august 31 2011 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2011 would result in a decrease in operating income by 131 million over the next twelve months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2011 would increase the fair value of total assets by 282 million and equity by 205 million 

interest rate risk 

the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents at august 31 2011 was 182 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition and are reported at fair value it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents have been significantly impacted by current market events including the recent credit crisis

additional information 

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

 

   

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 

factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the following factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect its stock price 

risk factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset’s forwardlooking statements made by or on the company’s behalf include without limitation 

a prolonged decline in equity returns impacting the buying power of factset’s investment management clients 

despite recent market improvements since september 1 2008 major equity indices  eg  dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp 500 and nasdaq composite and the global economy have experienced increased levels of volatility 

approximately 82 of the company’s annual subscription value is derived from its investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

while increased use of factset services among hedge funds is not a significant driver of recent revenue growth the company does have more hedge fund clients today than three years ago a decline in the equity markets could increase the normal rate of hedge fund closures and increase asset redemption rates in the near term many hedge funds rely on performance fees and utilize leverage in addition the rate of closure related to small hedge funds may increase if they were relying on performance fees to cover operating costs 

historically the correlation between the results of the company’s operations and the performance of the global equity markets has not been one to one today the company believes that its market opportunity may be 10 times its current size even if the global equity markets which we service shrink by 10 difficult market conditions may increase the value of the company’s ability to consolidate services for clients including deploying realtime news and quotes and may help advance the sales of proprietary content 

continued uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause us to lose additional clients and users 

the global investment banking industry has been experiencing uncertainty consolidation and business failures since 2008 the uncertainty consolidation and business failures have resulted and are expected to continue to result in a reduction in the number of users and prospective clients from the investment banking sector factset’s sellside clients account for approximately 18 of its revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the continued lack of available credit continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect factset’s financial results and future growth 

factset services equity research and ma departments these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of its clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities the company’s revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments 

a global market crisis and related economic recession may affect factset’s revenues and liquidity 

current global economic and financial market conditions and the potential for a significant and prolonged global economic recession could adversely affect factset’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity the worldwide impact of the recent global economic downturn and related market uncertainty including the recent european economic and 

  

financial uncertainty related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries could materially impact clients including large accounts causing them to go out of business entirely defer reduce or not increase the volume of the subscriptions they purchase from factset in the future or terminate existing relationships changes of this type could significantly affect factset’s business and liquidity or could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 

increased competition in factset’s industry that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products its competitors range in size from multibillion dollar companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors may offer price incentives to acquire new business competitive pricing pressures did not have a material impact on the company’s results of operations during fiscal 2010 or in any other fiscal year presented however future competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions can also result in clients’ seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources 

the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services in the past two years factset saw clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected alternatively clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors by selecting vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their need for financial market data if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

factset must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to maintain its leading technological position 

the market for factset is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards new technologies or industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and product enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis or at all and the company’s new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements 

factset’s ability to integrate and market factset proprietary data as a high quality asset and win new clients 

fiscal 2010 was a year of significant growth in the company’s proprietary content collection efforts in order to meet the needs of our clients factset now offers the following proprietary datasets that include the latest most accurate information available fundamentals estimates ownership corporate new issues people private equity and venture capital mergers and acquisitions corporate events and transcripts fixed income global filings and benchmark data factset understands that data is part of a broader investment process so the company makes timeliness and reliability a priority in order to ensure accuracy timeliness and reliability of the data factset must continue to build on its content collection operations to populate the proprietary content databases as of august 31 2010 there were over 2000 employees in hyderabad and manila responsible for collecting and publishing data on thousands of global companies using a proprietary factset collection process this complex process involves hiring training and retaining thousands of employees and successfully deploying collection software and processes in addition factset must be able to market and sell this proprietary content to new and existing clients 

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

many of factset’s products and services as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of the company’s security measures could expose factset its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company’s brand and reputation 

  

 

a prolonged or recurring outage at one of factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations however the insurance factset carries is likely not to be sufficient to compensate the company fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such material events in addition a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

malicious ignorant or illegal employee acts regarding insider information 

if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls surrounding insider information or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation misappropriation of insider information by an employee which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of the company’s insider information could expose factset its clients or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company’s brand and reputation 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt factset’s operations 

despite factset’s implementation of network security measures its servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with the company’s computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on factset’s business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine the company’s own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm factset’s business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations by clients factset’s business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

factset’s ability to integrate newly acquired companies 

factset has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions from time to time acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into factset’s operations and there can be no assurances that factset will manage acquisitions successfully the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business 

under generally accepted accounting principles factset reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in its industry factset may be required to record a charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on its results of operations 

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing data sets or products 

factset is a provider of global financial and economic information including fundamental financial data on tens of thousands of companies worldwide the company combines hundreds of databases including content regarding tens of thousands of companies and securities from major markets all over the globe into a single online platform of information and analytics clients have access to the data and content found within these databases which they can combine and utilize in nearly all of the company’s applications these databases are important to the company’s operations because they provide its clients with key information such as company fundamentals estimates global equity ownership ma data events and transcripts earnings and other equity and fixed income data 

during fiscal 2010 the company continued to expand its core competency and increased its proprietary content collection efforts in order to meet the needs of its clients all of the company’s proprietary data sets across the entire spectrum of content have been fully integrated into the new factset application however not all of the global financial and economic 

  

data provided by the company to investment professionals is proprietary factset aggregates thirdparty content from more than 85 data suppliers and over 100 news sources and exchanges the company integrates content from premier providers such as thomson standard  poor’s financial services llc ftse idc dow jones  company inc northfield information services inc msci barra apt global insight inc morningstar inc russell investments and six telekurs ltd the company has entered into thirdparty content agreements with varying lengths from as long as five years to as short as on an adhoc basis the agreements in some cases can be terminated on one year’s notice at predefined dates in other cases on shorter notice no single vendor or data supplier represented 10 or more of factset’s total expenses in any fiscal year presented 

the company seeks to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each type of financial data however this is not possible for all types of data certain data sets that factset relies on have a limited number of suppliers although the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available these data sets include 1 equity pricing from exchanges such as nasdaq 2 global exchange indices 3 sp cusip distribution 4 sp ratings and 5 moody’s investor service corporate ratings the data provided to factset clients from each of these databases is essential to the end user’s workflow and financial analysis factset combines the data from these commercial databases into its own dedicated single online service which the client accesses to perform their analysis the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows 

the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because 65 of factset’s employees and over 37 of its leased office space are located outside the us these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial results and cash flows the company’s primary exposures relate to nonus dollar denominated expenses in europe japan india and the philippines this exposure has increased during fiscal 2010 as compared to the year ago period primarily because the company’s international employee base is up 63 from 1627 employees at august 31 2009 to 2660 at august 31 2010 a decrease in the value of the us dollar increases operating expenses from time to time factset enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations factset’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights 

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms enter into settlements require factset to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients including contractual provisions under various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

factset defends its intellectual property rights and combats unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of its rights is difficult while these activities adversely affect us revenues the impact on revenues from outside the us could be more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 

unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of factset’s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 

factset’s success depends significantly upon its proprietary technology factset has registered trademarks and copyrights for many of its products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate factset generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees clients resellers vendors and others the company seeks to protect its software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws while factset does not believe it is dependent on any one of its intellectual property rights the company does rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect its proprietary rights despite these efforts existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection in addition it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of factset content or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use its proprietary information in addition factset cannot be certain that others will not develop or acquire substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology or that equivalent or better products will not be marketed in competition with its services thereby substantially reducing the value of its proprietary rights despite the company’s efforts to protect its proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of its products or to obtain and use information that factset regards as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws in the us litigation may be necessary to protect the company’s proprietary technology which may be timeconsuming and expensive with no assurance of success 

  

 

volatility in general economic conditions 

future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates interest rate increases inflationary pressures or volatile energy prices political or social unrest terrorist attacks economic instability or natural disasters in a specific country or region environmental and trade protection measures political considerations that affect data and service providers and government spending patterns health or similar issues such as pandemic or epidemic difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries factset believes that demand for its solutions could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations disruptions instability or downturns in the economy which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay cancel or reduce any planned expenditures any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company’s revenues expenses and financial condition 

risks of doing business internationally 

during fiscal 2010 approximately 32 of the company’s revenue was generated outside the us because factset sells its services outside the us its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally in addition employee count overseas grew significantly due to the factset content collection operations in india and the philippines as of august 31 2010 the company employed 2660 employees outside the us representing 65 of all employees companywide 

international operations are subject to inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenue or results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

factset’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for technical personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships in order to ensure accuracy timeliness and reliability of the company’s proprietary data factset must continue to hire qualified employees for its content collection operations factset must be successful in the hiring training and retaining of thousands of employees and successfully deploying collection software and processes 

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

factset is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of its business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes tax liability or effective tax rates in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its provision for income taxes and tax liability 

  

 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset’s operating results 

factset is party to lawsuits in the normal course of its business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain matters in which factset is involved see item 3 legal proceedings  contained in part i of this report 

changes in accounting may affect factset’s reported earnings and operating income 

factset prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles and accompanying accounting standards implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of its business are highly complex and involve subjective judgments changes in accounting rules their interpretation or changes in the company’s products or business could significantly change its reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures without a comparable underlying change in cash flows from operations 

in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements factset uses certain estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and management’s knowledge of current events and actions that factset may undertake in the future significant estimates have been made in areas that include income taxes useful lives of fixed assets and intangibles fair value measurements accrued compensation stockbased compensation receivable reserves contingent liabilities and allocation of purchase price to assets and liabilities acquired in addition factset makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion and therefore actual results may differ 

internal controls may be ineffective 

effective internal controls are necessary to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 factset is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in its implementation its business and operating results could be adversely impacted

results of operations 

for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report 

 

 revenues 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

revenues in fiscal 2010 were 6411 million up 31 from 6220 million for the same period a year ago we delivered solid growth across a range of product areas and geographic regions the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 experienced the highest quarterly change in the last two years for both client and user growth during fiscal 2010 our user count increased by 5500 net new clients rose to 65 and annual subscriptions increased by 61 million broadbased growth has been the catalyst for accelerating our organic asv growth rate to 7 over the past 12 months we have been focusing on promoting the new factset workstation and upgrading existing clients to this more intuitive easier to use platform upgrades to the new factset are occurring at a pace inline with our internal goals we have gained new clients at traditional money managers regional broker dealers and among research and sales departments both in the us and internationally as new and existing clients continue to value our functionality and content our buyside clients continue to experience strong growth across all geographies and represented 82 of our total revenues in fiscal 2010 consistent with the prior year 

positive revenue drivers during fiscal 2010 were the expanded deployment of our proprietary data across all geographies including incremental subscriptions to factset fundamentals and estimates the continued development of new functionality within factset that improves our clients’ processes our ability to consolidate multiple services into one through the factset platform enabling our clients to recognize efficiencies in many instances clients continuing to license our advanced applications such as portfolio analysis “pa” an annual price increase for our investment management clients 39 million of incremental revenue from the acquisition of market metrics on june 1 2010 and a meaningful reduction in the number of client cancels 

expanded deployment of our proprietary data 

traditionally factset has been known for its breadth of functionality and outstanding client support and service we are now seeing the benefits of coupling these strengths with proprietary content that we can control and differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ databases the sale and expanded deployment of our proprietary data both on and off the standard factset platform was a revenue driver during 2010 we are pleased by the growing returns from our investment in proprietary content the acceptance rate of factset fundamentals by new and existing clients continues to grow we now offer a more complete robust product with our proprietary content seamlessly integrated into our industryleading software during the past 12 months we have reduced our third party vendor payments related to fundamental and estimates data by 61 million due to clients switching to factset fundamentals and factset estimates from third party vendor databases 

new functionality within factset that improves our clients’ processes and consolidate multiple services into one platform 

in september 2009 we released our newest financial software platform the new factset and have been introducing it to our clients and prospects the new factset consolidates data and analytics previously spread across multiple applications into one comprehensive intuitive interface improving both functionality and ease of use we continue to receive positive feedback on our new user interface and believe that the new factset is deepening the engagement level of thousands of users as our broad range of content and functionality is readily accessible through the new user interface realtime news and quotes is a product that services the needs of a global investor and continues to be a source of revenue growth for us realtime users have increased every quarter since it was released in 2002 deployment of realtime news and quotes has resulted in a significant increase in user count over the last 12 months in conjunction with the release of the new factset in addition the ability for our end users to access more than 85 premium thirdparty content providers and integrate their own data for use in factset applications continues to be a reason for revenue growth we continue to appeal to larger institutions because of our ability to service many different user groups and our ability to deliver intensive computing power and analytics to end users 

  

 

growth in our advanced applications 

during fiscal 2010 our core applications continued to be in demand by our clients as sales of our quantitative products accelerated and led to revenue growth year over year we expanded our pa suite in 2010 to include axioma models which were well received by our client base since september 1 2009 the number of pa users increased by 651 while the number of pa clients rose by 46 the rise in users of pa during the past year was primarily from our largest investment management clients the pa suite is made of eight separate products and describing the growth of one does not always accurately portray how this suite of products has performed and understates the breadth of clients who rely on our advance analytics after this report and going forward we will disclose changes in asv from changes in subscription levels to our advanced analytics products without providing specific metrics on the number of clients and users of pa 

annual price increases for our investment management clients 

an annual price increase was implemented for our us investment management clients in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 and attributed 77 million to our asv growth in the year in addition an annual price increase for our nonus investment management clients was rolled out during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 which increased asv by 13 million 

partially offsetting the positive revenue drivers discussed above were continued client consolidations firm failures and sellside companies that scaled back expenditures in the first half of fiscal 2010 emphasizing savings over spending during the first six months of fiscal 2010 the sales environment was challenging for us as our sellside clients made changes to stabilize themselves several of our largest banking clients ceased operations as employment contracted across most of the industry resulting in a 09 million decrease in our sellside asv through the first six months of fiscal 2010 despite the ongoing volatility in the global markets we continued to focus on our selling efforts and in the second half of fiscal 2010 began to see the results of some sales opportunities that first developed during the recent market downturn although the market is still stabilizing revenues grew 31 year over year 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

revenues in fiscal 2009 advanced to 6220 million from 5755 million in fiscal 2008 revenue growth of 81 in fiscal 2009 was driven by expanded deployment of our proprietary data our realtime news and quotes and clients continuing to license our advanced applications 

sales of proprietary content are a growing source of revenue both new and existing clients continue to deploy factset fundamentals in addition our investment to expand coverage globally and add textual research from sellside firms has led to growth in the demand for factset estimates realtime news and quotes is a product that services the needs of a global investor and continues to be a source of revenue growth for us deployment of realtime news and quotes has been strong over the past four fiscal quarters with a 27 increase in user count year over year our clients continue to license our advanced portfolio applications pa 20 clients rose by 10 in fiscal 2009 with approximately 647 clients consisting of 5640 users subscribed to pa as of august 31 2009 

revenue growth from sellside clients was negative in fiscal 2009 as several of our largest banking clients ceased operations and employment contracted across most of the sellside resulting in a 15 decrease in our sellside user count since september 1 2008 revenues from our investment banking clients expressed as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 18 in fiscal 2009 as compared to 21 in fiscal 2008 however during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we began to see a change in the overall business environment resulting in more capital market transactions and a corresponding decline in our clients’ willingness to trim deployment of financial information systems 

revenues by geographic region 

 

   

 

revenues from our us business increased 27 to 4354 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 4239 million in the same period a year ago revenues from our us business rose 64 in fiscal 2009 up from 3983 million in fiscal 2008 our revenue growth rates in the us reflect modest client and user growth our realtime news and quotes capabilities included in the new factset growth in pa the expanded deployment of our proprietary our annual price increase for us investment management clients 39 million from the acquisition of market metrics partially offset by client consolidations firm failures and sellside companies that scaled back expenditures in the first half of fiscal 2010 the annual price increase for our us investment management clients in january 2010 drove revenues up by approximately 5 million in fiscal 2010 

international revenues in fiscal 2010 were 2057 million an increase of 38 from 1981 million in the prior year period the impact from foreign currency increased international revenues by 09 million year over year european revenues advanced 32 to 1616 million largely related to offering a broader selection of global content and the continued deployment of our portfolio analysis risk and quantitative applications asia pacific revenues grew to 441 million up 62 from the same period a year ago a reflection of our ability to sell additional services to existing clients expansion of our realtime news and quotes that services the needs of a global investor and a reallocation of sellside investment professionals to major nonus money centers revenues from international operations accounted for 32 of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2010 consistent with fiscal 2009 international growth rates were also positively impacted by our annual price increase for nonus investment management clients in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 which increased revenues by approximately 05 million 

international revenues increased 118 in fiscal 2009 up from 1772 million in fiscal 2008 the impact from foreign currency reduced international revenues by 02 million in fiscal 2009 european revenues advanced 110 to 1566 million and asia pacific revenues grew to 415 million up 148 from fiscal 2008 

annual subscription value asv 

asv at a given point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services being supplied to our clients with proper notice to us our clients are generally able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time excluding 16 million from the acquisition of market metrics and 1 million from the impact of foreign currency asv increased 7 over the last twelve months at august 31 2010 asv was 684 million up from the prior year total of 623 million of this total 82 of asv derives from buyside clients and the remainder from the sellside firms who perform ma advisory work and equity research asv from international operations increased from 200 million at august 31 2009 to 218 million at august 31 2010 representing 32 of the companywide total broadbased growth has been the catalyst for accelerating our growth rate to 7 in fiscal 2010 as we saw our client base stabilize drivers of asv growth were existing clients continuing to order additional factset proprietary content portfolio analytics the expansion of user count within our global banking and brokerage clients the increased commitment of our buyside clients and a 9 million annual price increase for our investment management clients worldwide with the financial industry recovering from the market lows of 2009 and most major stock indices exhibiting signs of stability our clients entered 2010 with more optimism and were looking for ways to improve their investment process this improved mindset coupled with our strategy of continual product and service enhancement translated into strong asv growth in fiscal 2010 

asv growth in fiscal 2009 was generated from our ability to license our proprietary content and an improved performance in both the us and international investment management client base which demonstrates our ability to deepen the engagement of existing factset users demand for pa and realtime news and quotes continued to be positive as pa 20 client count grew and our realtime news and quotes experienced a 27 increase in user count year over year success with these applications partially offset the reduction of our asv due to a difficult operating environment for investment banks an already difficult selling environment was amplified by weakening equity markets in fiscal 2009 in the last calendar quarter of 2008 sellside firms scaled back expenditures emphasizing savings over spending cost cuts were significant due to the decline in asset values and the majority of our clients implemented expense reductions these actions reduced our user growth in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the performance of portfolio analytics including factset fundamentals and estimates enhanced our asv growth 

users and clients 

at august 31 2010 professionals using factset increased to 42800 up 5500 users from the beginning of the year client count was 2110 as of august 31 2010 a net increase of 65 clients during fiscal 2010 at august 31 2010 the average asv per client was 324000 up from 305000 at august 31 2009 and 298000 at august 31 2008 user and client growth showed the highest quarterly change in the last two years during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 our client count expanded with 65 net new clients during fiscal 2010 as we saw fewer cancellations and more new clients the decline in cancellations is directly correlated to a decrease in firm closures total user count growth of 5500 professionals over the past 12 months was from both buyside and sellside firms and driven by the combination of advanced factset applications including realtime news and quotes with a vast array of data supported by factset client service 

  

 

at august 31 2009 client count was 2045 a net decline of 40 clients over the prior year sellside firms continued to scale back as the headcount reduction in 2009 was almost entirely sellside driven and was the effect of several large mergers and industrywide employee reductions the lack of available credit throughout most of the fiscal year adversely impacted the number of ma transactions and the profitability of sellside banks 

at august 31 2010 annual client retention was greater than 95 of asv consistent with last year on a client basis our annual retention rate improved to 90 of clients at august 31 2010 as compared to 87 a year ago reflecting a reduction in client turnover although we continue to see client consolidations and firm failures in the industry we are experiencing the success of some longer term sales efforts as firms are more willing to commit to factset to replace other systems demonstrating the value of our service to clients as of august 31 2010 our largest individual client accounted for less than 2 of total asv subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not surpass 16 of total asv as of august 31 2010 consistent with august 31 2009 and down from 17 as of august 31 2008

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

for the twelve months ended august 31 2010 cost of services decreased 1 to 2066 million as compared to 2094 million in the same period a year ago cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues was 322 during fiscal 2010 a decline of 145 basis points from fiscal 2009 the decrease year over year was driven by lower levels of third party data costs and a reduction in data vendor royalty payments partially offset by higher employee compensation 

data costs expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 210 basis points for the twelve months ended august 31 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 lower external collection costs were the result of a reduction in data amortization expense associated with the thomson reuters transition services agreement and the termination of a business process outsourcing “bpo” relationship in may 2009 variable fees payable to data vendors based on deployment of their content over the factset platform declined as the result of increased client usage of our proprietary content including factset fundamentals factset estimates and factset economics annual thirdparty royalty payments were reduced by 61 million in fiscal 2010 due to the deployment of our own proprietary content over the factset platform 

an increase in employee compensation partially offset the overall decrease to cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period a year ago employee compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 70 basis points during the twelve months ended august 31 2010 due to expanding the number of employees in our offshore proprietary content collection operations and increased variable compensation over the last 12 months we have increased our content collection headcount by over 900 employees primarily at our offshore facilities in india and the philippines at august 31 2010 approximately 55 of our employees were involved with content collection as compared to 45 at august 31 2009

employee compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points during fiscal 2009 due to expanding the number of employees primarily for our investment in factset fundamentals which was not in operation before august 2008 the first quarter of fiscal 2009 marked the first full quarter of operations for factset fundamentals employee count as of august 31 2009 was 2962 up 53 over the prior year and was driven by the expansion of factset’s proprietary content operation including the factset fundamentals collection team we discontinued a bpo relationship in may 2009 computer related expenses including computer maintenance costs rose 30 basis points in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the transition to hewlett packard integrity mainframe machines in our data centers 

  

computer maintenance contracts on the new mainframe machines commenced one year after deployment as each were covered under warranty during fiscal 2008 computer depreciation increased 20 basis points in fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2008 because no mainframe machines became fully depreciated during in fiscal 2009 

a reduction in data costs partially offset the overall increase to cost of services in fiscal 2009 data costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 lower data costs were the result of ending a bpo relationship in may 2009 and a reduction in variable fees payable to data vendors based on deployment of their content over the factset platform

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased 6 to 2129 million in fiscal 2010 from 2016 million in fiscal 2009 sga expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues rose 80 basis points to 332 in fiscal 2010 from 324 a year ago the increase was driven by higher employee compensation a rise in travel and entertainment “te” expenses increased occupancy costs including the amortization and depreciation of furniture fixtures and leasehold improvements and higher marketing costs partially offset by foreign currency

te expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 30 basis points during fiscal 2010 compared to the same period in fiscal 2009 primarily due to more client visits and an increase in us traveling overseas during the past 12 months travel has increased to enable us to manage our hyderabad and manila operations as we continue to expand our proprietary content collection total te costs related to air travel and hotel stays by us employees rose by 30 year over year as a result of increased international airline ticketing fees and hotel costs occupancy costs including rent and depreciation of furniture and fixtures expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 65 basis points compared to a year ago due to recent office expansions in new york hyderabad and manila in addition to the acquisition of market metrics on june 1 2010 occupancy costs continue to rise as we further fitout space for our content collection operations in the far east marketing expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points compared to a year ago as we increased the number of advertising campaigns in fiscal 2010 to market the new factset especially in london new york and chicago

employee compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 135 basis points during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to favorable currency rates and reduced headcount growth in the us and europe the us dollar strengthened during fiscal 2009 reducing our international employee compensation base the decrease in te costs expressed as a percentage of revenues of 145 basis points in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due a decrease in the cost per trip a prudent approach to interoffice travel and the occurrence of our engineering conference only in fiscal 2008 

a reduction in employee compensation and te was partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs year in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 occupancy costs including rent and depreciation of furniture and fixtures expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 45 basis points in fiscal 2009 due to recent office expansions in boston new york norwalk hyderabad tokyo and manila 

  

 

operating income and operating margin 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

operating income increased 5 to 2216 million in fiscal 2010 from 2110 million in fiscal 2009 our operating margin during fiscal 2010 was 346 up 70 basis points from 339 a year ago primarily due to lower data costs and foreign currency gains from hedging activities partially offset by higher compensation expense and a rise in te and occupancy costs since 98 of our asv is billed in us dollars the strengthening of the us dollar year over year improved our operating margin 70 basis points foreign currency reduced our operating expenses by 38 million and increased operating income by 47 million during fiscal 2010 over the past 12 months we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 95 of our net euro exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and 95 of our net british pound sterling exposure through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 a continued focus on efficiency and trimming nonessential costs has allowed factset to improve operating income and margin in an environment with 3 revenue growth year over year 

partially offsetting the benefit from favorable currency rates and lower data costs was the continued investment in our personnel employee count grew 39 to 4116 as of august 31 2010 and was driven by the expansion of our proprietary content collection operations in india and the philippines as well as the hiring of consultants and software engineers in the second half of fiscal 2010 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

operating income was up 15 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 our operating margin was 339 in fiscal 2009 an increase of 190 basis points from 320 in fiscal 2008 the 190 basis point increase was primarily due to favorable currency rates cost saving initiatives and incremental stockbased compensation in the prior year the strengthening of the us dollar improved our operating margin by 220 basis points as operating expenses were reduced by 138 million and operating income increased 136 million during fiscal 2009 cost saving initiatives covered a range of operational areas including implementing more cost effective means to connect clients to our data centers data cost reductions from renegotiating terms with vendors review of usage data for royaltybased payments implementing an approval process to encourage a more judicious approach to interoffice travel reducing the number of expatriot assignments improving our marketing spend efficiency and using the capabilities of a laptop to eliminate the need to purchase a phone for every employee included in fiscal 2008 was a pretax charge of 24 million related to an increase in the estimate of the number of performancebased stock options that vested in august 2008 the change in the estimate increased operating expenses by 24 million in the year ago period and decreased operating margins by 40 basis points 

factset fundamentals expenses in fiscal 2009 partially offset operating margin growth by 120 basis points when compared to fiscal 2008 as compensation expense from new employee growth to support the fundamental collection operation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and prepaid daily database updates were incurred

operating income from our us business decreased 5 to 1360 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 1429 million in the same period a year ago the decrease in operating income from our us business was due to higher compensation expense a rise in te expense and increased occupancy and marketing costs partially offset by 114 million of incremental revenues and lower data costs the increase in us employee compensation is due to a 9 headcount growth in the us normal merit salary increases of approximately 5 and higher variable compensation te rose because we had more client visits and increased travel from the us to our content collections operations in india and the philippines during fiscal 2010 we entered into a new lease agreement to expand our new york location by 22000 square feet to support operations resulting in 

  

higher occupancy costs in the current year as well as incremental future minimum rental payments of 62 million over the remaining noncancelable lease term lastly marketing costs increased in fiscal 2010 as compared to the prior year in the us and throughout each operating segment as we released the new factset in september 2009 revenues from our us business increased 114 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a year ago due to client and user growth our realtime news and quotes capabilities included in the new factset growth in pa the expanded deployment of our proprietary our annual price increase for us investment management clients 39 million from the acquisition of market metrics partially offset by client consolidations firm failures and sellside companies that scaled back expenditures in the first half of fiscal 2010 

european operating income increased 287 million in fiscal 2010 compared to same period a year ago the increase in european operating income is due to a 50 million increase in revenues favorable currency exchange rates lower variable fees payable to data vendors a reduction in data amortization expense associated with the thomson reuters transition services agreement and the termination of a bpo relationship in may 2009 european revenues advanced 50 million due to a broader selection of global content and the continued deployment of our portfolio analysis risk and quantitative applications the strengthening of the us dollar against the british pound sterling and euro year over year resulted in a benefit to operating income by 55 million within the european segment 

asia pacific operating income decreased 55 to 93 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 205 million in fiscal 2009 the decrease in asia pacific operating income is primarily driven by the offshore expansion of our proprietary content operations in india and the philippines as well as increased occupancy costs for our office expansions in japan india and the philippines partially offset by a 6 increase in revenues employee compensation increased due to expanding the number of employees in our offshore proprietary content collection operations over the last 12 months we have increased our content collection headcount by over 900 employees at our offshore facilities in india and the philippines at august 31 2010 approximately 55 of our employees are involved with content collection as compared to 45 at august 31 2009

 other income 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

during fiscal 2010 the federal reserve continued to maintain low us interest rates which reduced returns on our investments in us treasuries and us government agency securities the low interest rates resulted in a decrease in other income by 05 million in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 at no time during fiscal 2010 did a component of our investment portfolio experience a decline in value due to a ratings change default or increase in counterparty credit risk 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008

income taxes 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2010 the provision for income taxes increased 7 to 720 million as compared to fiscal 2009 due to higher pretax income partially offset by income tax benefits of 13 million our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 before discrete items of 13 million was 329 our annual effective tax rate before discrete items for fiscal 2009 was 336 a 70 basis point decrease year over year primarily due to higher levels of nonus taxable income and an increase in our domestic production activities section 199 deduction 

during fiscal 2010 we recorded income tax benefits of 13 million associated with the finalization of our fiscal 2009 tax return adjustments to certain reserves to reflect the lapse of statute of limitations and higher levels of nonus taxable income the fiscal 2010 effective tax rate appropriately reflects the us federal rd credit only for the first four months of our 2010 fiscal year as the rd credit expired on december 31 2009 our effective tax rate is based on current enacted tax laws and as such reflects the rd tax credit only for the first four months of fiscal 2010 the expiration of the rd tax credit on december 31 2009 resulted in a 100 basis point increase in our fiscal 2010 effective tax rate 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

the provision for income taxes advanced 5 in fiscal 2009 from 640 million in fiscal 2008 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 317 compared to 339 in fiscal 2008 the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 of 220 basis points was due to 40 million of income tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2009 from the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit in october 2008 retroactive to january 1 2008 finalizing our prior year tax returns a tax credit for repatriating foreign earnings to the us and adjusting certain reserves to reflect the lapse of statute of limitations

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

net income rose 16 to 1449 million and diluted earnings per common share increased 19 to 297 in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 included in fiscal 2009 was a 003 per share benefit from the reenactment of the us federal rd credit in october 2008 a 006 per share benefit related to finalizing prior years’ tax returns and repatriating foreign earnings to the us and a 003 per share benefit from incremental stockbased compensation in the prior year related to performancebased options partially offset by a 009 per share reduction in diluted earnings per share from factset fundamentals factset fundamentals expenses in fiscal 2009 were primarily compensation from new employee growth to support the fundamental collection operation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and prepaid daily database updates 

foreign currency 

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains and losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity transaction gains and losses that arise from the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in determining net income for the period in which exchange rates change 

  

 

as depicted in the chart below our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 17 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 128 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 111 million per year 

 

 our primary foreign currency exchange exposures are related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where approximately 65 of our employees are located foreign currency movements increased diluted earnings per share by 007 in fiscal 2010 when holding currencies constant from fiscal 2009 

to reduce variability in operating expenses denominated in british pound sterling and euro from foreign currency fluctuations we entered into foreign currency forward contracts during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 as of august 31 2010 we have hedged 95 of our net euro exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and 95 of our net british pound sterling exposure through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 in designing a specific hedging approach we considered several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures forecasting risk and potential ineffectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings 

at august 31 2010 the notional principal and fair value liability of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with us dollars were €325 million and 12 million respectively the notional principal and fair value asset of foreign exchange contracts to purchase british pound sterling with us dollars were £211 million and 09 million respectively at august 31 2010 a gain on derivatives for the twelve months ended august 31 2010 of 08 million was recorded into operating income in our consolidated statements of income as compared to a loss of 52 million in fiscal 2009

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2010 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

  

  

  

 purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations 

expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations 

share repurchase program 

on june 14 2010 our board of directors approved an expansion of the existing share repurchase program by an additional 150 million during fiscal 2010 we repurchased 28 million shares for 193 million under the program including the expansion 159 million remains authorized for future share repurchases as of august 31 2010 repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations 

we expect that for the next year our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow in addition we may use cash to fund other acquisitions repurchase additional common stock or invest in other businesses when opportunities arise based upon the predominance of our revenues from recurring sources and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend payments stock repurchases and financing activities for the next year 

  

 

on march 16 2009 our board of directors approved an expansion of the existing share repurchase program by an additional 100 million during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 22 million shares for 104 million under the program at august 31 2009 102 million remained authorized for future share repurchases 

dividends 

on may 14 2010 our board of directors approved a 15 increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with our dividend payment in june 2010 of 023 per share or 092 per share per annum the cash dividend of 107 million was paid on june 15 2010 to common stockholders of record on may 28 2010 on august 10 2010 a regular quarterly dividend of 023 per share was announced the cash dividend of 106 million was paid on september 21 2010 to common stockholders of record on august 31 2010 future cash dividends will be paid using our existing and future cash generated by operations 

critical accounting estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are derived from monthtomonth subscriptions to services such as workstations also referred to as users content and applications subscription revenue is earned each month as the service is rendered to clients on a monthly basis revenue is recognized when the client subscribes to factset services the service has been rendered and earned during the month the amount of the subscription is fixed and determinable based on established rates quoted on an annualized basis and collectibility is reasonably assured 

receivable reserves 

our client base has generally been of a high quality and as such we have not historically experienced a high level of creditrelated writeoffs aged client receivables are analyzed each month and our collection efforts are directed accordingly we review recent history of client receivable writeoffs analyze trends in aged client receivables and general market conditions to estimate our accounts receivable reserve 

in accordance with this policy our receivable reserve was as follows in thousands except percentages 

 

 actual cancellations and billing adjustments could differ from those estimated amounts and could have an impact on the financial statements of higher or lower expense a 10 change in actual cancellations and billing adjustments during fiscal 2010 and 2009 would have affected our receivable reserves by approximately 01 million in both years 

fair value measures 

fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the “exit price” in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in determining fair value the use of various valuation methodologies including market income and cost approaches is permissible cash equivalents are classified as level 1 while our derivative instruments foreign exchange forward contracts are classified as level 2 our institutional money market funds are traded in an active market and the net asset value of each fund on the last day of the quarter is used to determine its fair value as such our cash equivalents are classified as level 1 we utilize the income approach to measure fair value for our derivative instruments foreign exchange forward contracts the income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as spot forward and interest rates as well as credit default swap spreads and therefore are classified as level 2 

the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to their estimate of fair value in the current market environment the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective 

  

however given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our derivatives and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of judgment was material to the valuations as of august 31 2010 

business combinations 

we record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting all of the assets acquired liabilities assumed contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill our estimates are based on historical experience information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and when appropriate includes assistance from independent thirdparty appraisal firms our significant assumptions and estimates can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future the appropriate weightedaverage cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information we determined that there were three reporting units during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 which are consistent with the operating segments reported because there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment during fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 were us europe and asia pacific which reflects the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 and determined that there were no reporting units that were deemed at risk and there had been no impairment the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2010 was 222 million 

we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset 

depreciable lives of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

the net book value of our property equipment and leasehold improvements at august 31 2010 was 79 million representing 12 of our consolidated total assets depreciation expense for the year ended august 31 2010 was 29 million or 7 of total operating expenses management’s judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 

property equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets’ estimated useful lives on a straightline basis for financial reporting purposes the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by us and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets technological life cycles and scheduled enhancements and upgrades a residual value is estimated at the time of asset acquisition and evaluated on a continual basis and as circumstances warrant the determination of a residual value is the anticipated fair market value of the acquired asset at the date of disposal or sale based on available market conditions circumstances and events relating to these assets such as system upgrades are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives residual values and impairments see “longlived assets” below are identified and prospective depreciation expense is adjusted or an impairment charge recorded accordingly 

  

 

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment and leasehold improvements are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2010 was 79 million 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

accrued compensation 

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 20 of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation as of august 31 2010 was 375 million 

stockbased compensation 

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which includes sharebased payment awards to employees a nonemployee director’s plan and an employee stock purchase plan see note 13 and note 14 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for a complete discussion of our stockbased compensation programs 

accounting guidance requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including stock options restricted stock and common shares acquired under employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values of the share awards that are scheduled to vest during the period 

the following table summarizes stockbased compensation expense for the twelve months ended august 31 2010 2009 and 2008 in thousands 

 

 as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based primarily on historical experience 

  

 

we utilize a latticebinomial optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of new employee stock option awards at the date of grant optionpricing models require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards expected dividend yield future option forfeitures and future employee stock option exercise behaviors changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

performancebased stock options 

performancebased stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets the number of performancebased options that vest will be predicated on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years subsequent to the date of grant dependent on the financial performance levels attained by us during the two subsequent fiscal years 0 20 60 or 100 of the performancebased stock options will vest to the grantees of those stock options there is no current guarantee however that such options will vest in whole or in part 

august 2007 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2007 we granted 896194 performancebased employee stock options none of these performancebased stock options granted vested because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2009 these performancebased options were recorded as forfeitures in august 2009 

august 2008 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2008 we granted 1058981 performancebased employee stock options none of these performancebased stock options granted vested because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2010 these performancebased options were recorded as forfeitures in august 2010 

october 2009 performancebased option grant review 

in october 2009 we granted 900665 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that vest is based on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2011 at august 31 2010 we estimated that 20 or 180133 of the performancebased stock options will vest which results in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 23 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by factset could result in the following changes to the company’s current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands 

 

  

 june 2010 performancebased option grant review 

in june 2010 we granted 820202 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that vest is based on us achieving certain asv levels over a six year period at august 31 2010 we estimated that 139509 of the performancebased stock options will vest which results in unamortized stockbased compensation expense of 26 million to be recognized over the remaining vesting period 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and domestic production activities section 199 deductions our effective tax rate was 324 317 and 339 in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

 

we recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is “morelikelythannot” that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest and related penalties if applicable on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements 

as of august 31 2010 we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 73 million including 11 of accrued interest recorded as noncurrent taxes payable in the statement of financial condition unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements if recognized essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income audits by multiple tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by lower earnings than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher earnings than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the postacquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine recognition and measurement further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption which we include here by reference 

recent market trends 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations despite recent market improvements since september 1 2008 major equity indices  eg  dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp 500 and nasdaq composite have experienced increased levels of volatility 

approximately 82 of our annual subscription value is derived from our investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

our sellside clients who perform ma advisory work and equity research account for approximately 18 of our annual subscription value a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the credit crisis that began in august 2007 continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients such as bear stearns lehman brothers merrill lynch and wachovia were purchased by other firms as their viability as standalone entities came into question more of our clients could encounter similar problems the recent lack of confidence in the global banking system caused declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional uncertainty consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect our financial results and future growth 

  

 

we service equity research and ma departments these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of our clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments 

historically the correlation between the results of our operations and the performance of the global equity markets has not been one to one today we believe that our market opportunity may be 10 times our current size even if the global equity markets which we service shrink by 10 difficult market conditions may increase the value of our ability to consolidate services for clients including deploying realtime news and quotes and may help advance the sales of proprietary content

financial risk management 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect operating results financial position and cash flows we manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk through our regular operating and financing activities and when appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments these derivative financial instruments are utilized to hedge currency exposures as well as to reduce earnings volatility resulting from shifts in market rates we only enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposures our primary foreign currency market exposures include the euro british pound sterling japanese yen indian rupee and philippines peso the fair market values of all our derivative contracts change with fluctuations in currency rates and are designed so that any changes in their values are offset by changes in the values of the underlying exposures derivative financial instruments are held solely as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 

we are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet the level of volatility will vary with the type and amount of derivative hedges outstanding as well as fluctuations in the currency markets during the period the related cash flow impacts of all of our derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities 

by their nature all derivative instruments involve to varying degrees elements of market and credit risk the market risk associated with these instruments resulting from currency exchange movements is expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions assets and liabilities being hedged we do not believe there is significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties associated with these instruments because these transactions are executed with two major financial institutions further our policy is to deal with counterparties having a minimum investment grade or better credit rating credit risk is managed through the continuous monitoring of exposures to such counterparties 

our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 17 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 128 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 111 million per year to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to limit our exposure related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we may continue to utilize foreign currency forward contracts see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis of our foreign currency exchange rate risk 

interest rate risk 

the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents at august 31 2010 was 196 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition and are reported at fair value it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investments policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents have been significantly impacted by the recent credit crisis 

current market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we conduct business outside the us in several currencies including the british pound sterling euro japanese yen indian rupee and philippines peso the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 17 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 128 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 111 million per year to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to manage the exposures related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we utilize derivative instruments foreign currency forward contracts our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency derivative financial instruments are held solely as risk management tools and not for trading or speculative purposes 

during fiscal 2010 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 95 of our net euro exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and 95 of our net british pound sterling exposure through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements these transactions are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  the changes in fair value for these foreign currency forward contracts are initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses when the hedged exposure affects earnings 

at august 31 2010 the notional principal and fair value liability of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with us dollars were €325 million and 12 million respectively the notional principal and fair value asset of foreign exchange contracts to purchase british pound sterling with us dollars were £211 million and 09 million respectively at august 31 2010 

a sensitivity analysis was performed based on the estimated fair value of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august 31 2010 if the us dollar had been 10 weaker the fair value of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts would have increased 73 million which would have had an immaterial impact on our consolidated balance sheet such a change in fair value of our financial instruments would be substantially offset by reductions in our euro and british pound sterling expense base had we not had any hedges in place as of august 31 2010 a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2010 would result in a decrease in operating income by 93 million over the next twelve months a hypothetical 10 weaker us dollar against all foreign currencies at august 31 2010 would increase the fair value of total assets by 22 million and equity by 18 million 

interest rate risk 

the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents at august 31 2010 was 196 million our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and money market funds with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition and are reported at fair value it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our cash and investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents have been significantly impacted by the recent credit crisis

 additional information 

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

 

   

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 

factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the following factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect its stock price 

risk factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any of factset’s forwardlooking statements made by or on the company’s behalf include without limitation 

a prolonged decline in equity returns impacting the buying power of factset’s investment management clients 

since september 1 2008 major equity indices eg dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp 500 and nasdaq composite have experienced declines greater than 15 coupled with increased levels of volatility a prolonged decline in the equity markets could impact the size and buying power of many of factset’s clients 

factset derives 82 of its revenues from investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management “aum” an equity market decline not only depresses aum but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

while increased use of factset services among hedge funds is not a significant driver of recent revenue growth the company does have more hedge fund clients today than three years ago a decline in the equity markets could increase the normal rate of hedge fund closures and increase asset redemption rates in the near term many hedge funds rely on performance fees and utilize leverage in addition the rate of closure related to small hedge funds may increase if they were relying on performance fees to cover operating costs 

historically the correlation between the results of factset’s operations and the performance of the global equity markets has not been one to one today the company believes that its market opportunity may be 10 times its current size even if the global equity markets which factset services shrink by 15 difficult market conditions may increase the value of factset’s ability to consolidate services for clients including deploying realtime news and quotes and may help advance the sales of proprietary content 

continued turmoil consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking industry may cause us to lose additional clients and users 

the global investment banking industry has been experiencing turmoil consolidation and business failures over the past two years the turmoil consolidation and business failures have resulted and are expected to continue to result in a reduction in the number of users and prospective clients from the investment banking sector factset’s sellside clients account for approximately 18 of its revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the credit crisis that began in august 2007 continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients such as bear stearns lehman brothers merrill lynch and wachovia were purchased by other firms as their viability as standalone entities came into question more of the company’s clients could encounter similar problems the recent lack of confidence in the global banking system caused declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional turmoil consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect factset’s financial results and future growth 

factset services equity research and ma departments these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of its clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities the company’s revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments 

  

a global market crisis and related economic recession may affect factset’s revenues and liquidity 

current global economic and financial market conditions and the potential for a significant and prolonged global economic recession could adversely affect factset’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity these conditions also could materially impact clients including large accounts causing them to go out of business entirely defer reduce or not increase the volume of the subscriptions they purchase from factset in the future or terminate existing relationships changes of this type could significantly affect factset’s business and liquidity or could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition if factset is unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial markets conditions the company may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and its business could be adversely affected in addition the current global economic conditions could reduce the overall demand for integrated financial information as global companies consolidate purchasing downsize departmental budgets and reduce companywide discretionary spending 

increased competition in factset’s industry that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products its competitors range in size from multibillion dollar companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized while the company believes the breadth and depth of its suite of products and applications offer benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors are likely to offer price incentives to acquire new business these competitive pricing pressures may result in decreased sales volumes and price reductions resulting in lower revenues weak economic conditions can also result in clients’ seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources 

the impact of costcutting pressures across the industries factset serves could lower demand for its services in fiscal 2009 factset saw clients intensify their focus on containing or reducing costs as a result of the more challenging market conditions clients within the financial services industry that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on financial market data and related services if clients elect to reduce their spending with factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected alternatively clients may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial market data services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors by selecting vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their need for financial market data if clients elect to consolidate their spending on financial market data services with other vendors and not factset the company’s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

factset must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to maintain its leading technological position 

the market for the company’s products is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards new products based on new technologies or new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products and product enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis or at all and the company’s new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements 

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

many of factset’s products and services as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of the company’s security measures could expose factset its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company’s brand and reputation 

a prolonged or recurring outage at one of factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to seek to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations in addition factset maintains insurance for some such events however the insurance factset carries is likely not to be sufficient to compensate the company fully for losses 

  

or damages that may occur as a result of such material events in addition a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

malicious ignorant or illegal employee acts regarding insider information 

if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls surrounding insider information or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation misappropriation of insider information by an employee which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of the company’s insider information could expose factset its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential clients and damage to the company’s brand and reputation 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt factset’s operations 

despite factset’s implementation of network security measures its servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with the company’s computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on factset’s business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine the company’s own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm factset’s business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations by clients factset’s business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

factset’s ability to integrate and market factset fundamentals as a high quality asset and win new clients 

factset fundamentals is projected to be accretive to earnings per share in fiscal 2010 in order to ensure accuracy of these estimates factset must build on a content collection operation to populate the factset fundamentals database this complex process involves hiring training and retaining hundreds of employees and successfully deploying collection software and processes in addition factset must be able to market and sell factset fundamentals to new and existing clients 

factset’s ability to integrate newly acquired companies 

factset has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions from time to time acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into factset’s operations and there can be no assurances that factset will manage acquisitions successfully the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business 

under generally accepted accounting principles factset reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in its industry factset may be required to record a charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on its results of operations 

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing databases or products 

as a leading provider of global financial and economic information factset relies on its ability to combine hundreds of commercial databases into its own dedicated online service factset’s business employs a wide variety of data from a substantial number of data suppliers around the world certain factset databases rely on a limited number of suppliers although factset makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact financial results and cash flows 

the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because 55 of factset’s employees and over 36 of its leased office space are located outside the us these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial results and cash flows the company’s primary exposures relate to nonus dollar denominated revenues and expenses in europe japan and india this exposure has increased during fiscal 2009 as compared to the year ago period primarily because the percentage of factset revenues invoiced and paid in nonus dollars has decreased a decrease in the value of the us dollar increases operating expenses from time to time factset enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations factset’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

  

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights 

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms enter into settlements require factset to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients including contractual provisions under various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

factset defends its intellectual property rights and combats unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of its rights is difficult while these activities adversely affect us revenues the impact on revenues from outside the us could be more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 

unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of factset’s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 

factset’s success depends significantly upon its proprietary technology factset has registered trademarks and copyrights for many of its products and services and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and copyrights as appropriate factset generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees customers resellers vendors and others the company seeks to protect its software documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws while factset does not believe it is dependent on any one of its intellectual property rights the company does rely on the combination of intellectual property rights and other measures to protect its proprietary rights despite these efforts existing intellectual property laws may afford only limited protection in addition it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of factset content or to reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use its proprietary information in addition factset cannot be certain that others will not develop or acquire substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology or that equivalent or better products will not be marketed in competition with its services thereby substantially reducing the value of its proprietary rights despite the company’s efforts to protect its proprietary rights unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of its products or to obtain and use information that factset regards as proprietary in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws in the us litigation may be necessary to protect the company’s proprietary technology which may be timeconsuming and expensive with no assurance of success 

volatility in general economic conditions 

future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates interest rate increases inflationary pressures or volatile energy prices political or social unrest terrorist attacks economic instability or natural disasters in a specific country or region environmental and trade protection measures political considerations that affect data and service providers and government spending patterns health or similar issues such as pandemic or epidemic including the h1n1 virus outbreak difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries factset believes that demand for its solutions could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations disruptions instability or downturns in the economy which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay cancel or reduce any planned expenditures any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company’s revenues expenses and financial condition 

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

factset’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for technical personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships 

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

factset is subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of its business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes tax liability or effective tax rates in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before 

  

taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its provision for income taxes and tax liability based on the results of an audit or litigation a material effect on its income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm factset’s operating results 

factset is party to lawsuits in the normal course of its business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain matters in which factset is involved see item 3 legal proceedings  contained in part i of this report 

changes in accounting may affect factset’s reported earnings and operating income 

generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of its business are highly complex and involve subjective judgments changes in accounting rules their interpretation or changes in the company’s products or business could significantly change its reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures without a comparable underlying change in cash flows from operations 

in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements factset uses certain estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and management’s knowledge of current events and actions that factset may undertake in the future significant estimates have been made in areas that include income and other taxes useful lives of fixed assets and intangibles accrued liabilities accrued compensation stockbased compensation receivable reserves contingent liabilities and allocation of purchase price to assets and liabilities acquired in addition factset makes certain estimates under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” 5 ac counting for contingencies  including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion and therefore actual results may differ 

internal controls may be ineffective 

effective internal controls are necessary to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 factset is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in its implementation its business and operating results could be adversely impacted

 revenues 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

revenues in fiscal 2009 advanced 8 to 6220 million from 5755 million for the same period a year ago and included 46 million from factset fundamentals revenue growth of 8 in fiscal 2009 was driven by expanded deployment of our proprietary data across all geographies including incremental subscriptions to factset fundamentals and estimates our realtime news and quotes capabilities included in the factset workstation clients continuing to license our advanced applications such as portfolio analysis “pa” and our ability to consolidate multiple services into one through the factset platform enabling our clients to recognize efficiencies in many instances our investment management client base continues to experience strong growth across all geographies and represented 82 of our total revenues in fiscal 2009 compared to 79 of total revenues in fiscal 2008 

sales of proprietary content continue to be a growing source of revenue both new and existing clients continue to deploy factset fundamentals in addition our investment to expand coverage globally and add textual research from sellside firms has led to growth in the demand for factset estimates realtime news and quotes is a product that services the needs of a global investor and continues to be a source of revenue growth for us deployment of realtime news and quotes has been strong over the past four fiscal quarters with a 27 increase in user count year over year our clients continue to license our advanced portfolio applications pa 20 clients rose by 10 in fiscal 2009 with approximately 647 clients consisting of 5640 users subscribed to pa as of august 31 2009 in addition the ability for our end users to access more than 85 premium thirdparty content providers and integrate their own data for use in factset applications continues to be a reason for revenue growth we continue to appeal to larger institutions because of our ability to service many different user groups and our ability to deliver intensive computing power and analytics to end users 

revenue growth from sellside clients was negative in fiscal 2009 during the past 18 months several of our largest banking clients ceased operations and employment contracted across most of the sellside resulting in a 15 decrease in our sellside user count since september 1 2008 revenues from our investment banking clients expressed as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 18 in fiscal 2009 as compared to 21 in fiscal 2008 however during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we saw growth in the sellside user count and as with the buyside recent market rallies are beginning to change the overall business environment resulting improved capital market transactions and a corresponding decline in our clients’ willingness to trim deployment of financial information systems 

  

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

revenues in fiscal 2008 increased 21 to 5755 million from 4758 million in fiscal 2007 the impact from foreign currency reduced international revenues by 29 million year over year the sale of additional services to existing investment management professionals was the primary catalyst of our revenue growth our investment management client base experienced strong growth across all geographies and represented approximately 79 of our total asv as of august 31 2008 the deepening engagement of existing factset users in our investment management business and the ability to consolidate multiple services into one through the factset platform resulted in revenue growth in fiscal 2008 realtime news and quotes our suite of portfolio analysis services ibcentral and our risk and quantitative services continued to expand across all geographies incremental content for nonus investors helped increase demand for our services outside the us 

revenues by geographic region 

 

 revenues from our us business increased 6 to 4239 million in fiscal 2009 compared to 3983 million in the same period a year ago revenues from our us business increased 19 in fiscal 2008 up from 3353 million in fiscal 2007 

international revenues in fiscal 2009 were 1981 million an increase of 12 from 1772 million in the prior year period the impact from foreign currency reduced international revenues by 02 million year over year european revenues advanced 11 to 1566 million largely related to offering a broader selection of global content and the continued deployment of our portfolio analysis risk and quantitative applications asia pacific revenues grew to 415 million up 15 from the same period a year ago revenues from international operations accounted for 32 of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2009 and 31 in fiscal 2008 our growth rates in europe and asia pacific reflect our ability to sell additional services to existing clients and a reallocation of sellside investment professionals to major nonus money centers especially in asia international revenues increased 26 in fiscal 2008 up from 1405 million in fiscal 2007 the impact from foreign currency increased international revenues by 29 million in fiscal 2008 european revenues advanced 23 to 1411 million and asia pacific revenues grew to 361 million up 38 from the same period a year ago 

annual subscription value  asv at a given point in time represents the forwardlooking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services being supplied to our clients with proper notice to us our clients are generally able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time at august 31 2009 asv was 619 million up 4 million or 1 from the prior year total of 615 million of this total 82 of asv derives from buyside clients and the remainder from the sellside firms who perform ma advisory work and equity research asv from international operations increased from 195 million at august 31 2008 to 200 million at august 31 2009 representing 32 of the companywide total asv growth in fiscal 2009 was generated from our ability to license our proprietary content and an improved performance in both the us and international investment management client base which demonstrates our ability to deepen the engagement of existing factset users demand for pa and realtime news and quotes continued to be positive pa 20 client count grew to 647 over the last 12 months while realtime news and quotes experienced a 27 increase in user count year over year success with these applications partially offset the reduction of our asv due to a difficult operating environment for investment banks an already difficult selling environment was amplified by weakening equity markets in fiscal 2009 in the last calendar quarter of 2008 sellside firms scaled back expenditures emphasizing savings over spending cost cuts were significant due to the decline in asset values and the majority of our clients implemented expense reductions these actions reduced our user growth in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the performance of portfolio analytics including factset fundamentals and estimates enhanced our asv growth 

asv at the end of fiscal 2008 was up 98 million or 19 from the prior year total of 517 million excluding currency and asv acquired from the acquisitions of dealmaven and thomson fundamentals asv increased 93 million in fiscal 2008 due to our ability to license our proprietary content including events and transcripts deal data and ownership data net addition of new clients growth in our pa suite of products incremental subscriptions to our services by existing clients and increased users and the deployment of solutions to service the global needs of large institutions 

  

users and clients  at august 31 2009 professionals using factset decreased to 37300 down 2800 users from the beginning of the year client count was 2045 as of august 31 2009 a net decrease of 40 clients during fiscal 2009 at august 31 2009 the average asv per client was 302000 up from 295000 at august 31 2008 and 265000 at august 31 2007 sellside firms continue to scale back on headcount the headcount reduction over the past 12 months was almost entirely sellside driven and is the effect of several large mergers and industrywide employee reductions the lack of available credit throughout most of the fiscal year adversely impacted the number of ma transactions and the profitability of sellside banks 

at august 31 2008 client count was 2085 a net increase of 132 clients or 7 over the prior 12 months the combination of advanced factset applications including realtime news and quotes with a vast array of data supported by factset client service contributed to our user growth in fiscal 2008 while the overall franchise value of large investment banks declined significantly in fiscal 2008 our investment banking user base grew 16 during fiscal 2008 

at august 31 2009 annual client retention was greater than 95 of asv consistent with the same period a year ago on a client basis our annual retention rate was 87 of clients at august 31 2009 a decrease from 92 a year ago this decline is a result of client losses relating primarily to small firms rather than larger institutions as of august 31 2009 our largest individual client accounted for less than 2 of total asv and asv from the ten largest clients did not surpass 16 of total client subscriptions down from 17 as of august 31 2008 

operating expenses 

 

 cost of services 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

cost of services advanced 9 to 2094 million in fiscal 2009 from 1912 million in fiscal 2008 cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 45 basis points to 337 during fiscal 2009 from 332 a year ago the increase was driven by higher employee compensation computer related expenses and computer depreciation partially offset by a reduction in data costs and favorable currency rates 

employee compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 20 basis points during fiscal 2009 due to expanding the number of employees primarily for our investment in factset fundamentals which was not in operation before august 2008 the first quarter of fiscal 2009 marked the first full quarter of operations for factset fundamentals employee count as of august 31 2009 was 2962 up 53 over the prior year and was driven by the expansion of factset’s proprietary content operation including the factset fundamentals collection team we discontinued a business process outsourcing “bpo” relationship in may 2009 computer related expenses including computer maintenance costs rose 30 basis points in fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to last year’s transition to hewlett packard integrity mainframe machines in our data centers computer maintenance contracts on the new mainframe machines commenced one year after deployment as each were covered under warranty during fiscal 2008 computer depreciation increased 20 basis points in fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2008 because no mainframe machines became fully depreciated during in fiscal 2009 

a reduction in data costs partially offset the overall increase to cost of services in fiscal 2009 data costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 20 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to the same period a year ago lower data costs were the result of ending a bpo relationship in may 2009 and a reduction in variable fees payable to data vendors based on deployment of their content over the factset platform in addition favorable currency rates partially offset the 45 basis point increase in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as the us dollar strengthened during fiscal 2009 especially against the euro and british pound sterling reducing our overall expense base 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

cost of services increased 25 in fiscal 2008 from 1528 million in fiscal 2007 the main drivers of the fiscal 2008 growth of 110 basis points were increases in employee compensation and additional data costs partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets and computer related expenses and depreciation 

  

employee compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues advanced 160 basis points during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 employee additions as well as normal merit increases primarily accounted for the increase in employee compensation employee count was up 17 in fiscal 2008 over the prior year data costs as a percentage of revenues rose by 65 basis points in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 driven by variable fees payable to data vendors from additional content subscriptions and higher levels of proprietary data content collection 

a reduction in computer related expenses and amortization of intangible assets partially offset the overall increase to cost of services in fiscal 2008 computer maintenance and depreciation decreased 75 basis points as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year the decrease in computer maintenance is a result of replacing the older existing hewlett packard alpha mainframe machines with new hewlett packard integrity mainframe machines in fiscal 2008 intangible asset amortization expense expressed as a percentage of revenues declined 30 basis points in fiscal 2008 compared to the same period in fiscal 2007 due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets from previous acquisitions compared to previous years 

selling general and administrative 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses advanced 1 to 2016 million in fiscal 2009 from 2004 million in fiscal 2008 however sga expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues declined to 324 in fiscal 2009 compared to 348 a year ago the decrease of 240 basis points in sga was driven by lower employee compensation and travel and entertainment “te” costs partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs 

employee compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 135 basis points during fiscal 2009 compared to the same period a year ago due to favorable currency rates and reduced headcount growth in the us and europe the us dollar strengthened during fiscal 2009 reducing our international employee compensation base the decrease in te costs expressed as a percentage of revenues of 145 basis points in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to three factors a decrease in the cost per trip a prudent approach to interoffice travel and the occurrence of our engineering conference only in the prior year 

a reduction in employee compensation and te was partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs year over year occupancy costs including rent and depreciation of furniture and fixtures expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 45 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to recent office expansions in boston new york norwalk hyderabad tokyo and manila 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

sga expenses advanced 19 to 2004 million in fiscal 2008 from 1679 million in fiscal 2007 sga expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues declined to 348 in fiscal 2008 compared to 353 a fiscal 2007 the decrease of 50 basis points in sga was driven by lower employee compensation and occupancy costs partially offset by an increase in stockbased compensation 

employee compensation expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased 50 basis points in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year period due to the ability to leverage sga staff through our enhanced internal information systems which allowed us to keep our sga headcount growth consistent with last year while growing our revenue base occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 25 basis points during fiscal 2008 as compared to the year ago period as the result of leveraging our existing space and was temporary based on the timing of acquiring new space to support a growing employee base 

partially offsetting the overall decrease to sga as a percentage of revenues was an increase in stockbased compensation to reflect the 18 million incremental charge to sga from performancebased stock options during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we estimated that it was probable we would achieve asv and diluted earnings per share growth of at least 20 on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended august 31 2008 this reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that vest at the end of fiscal 2008 and the stockbased compensation to record

operating income increased 15 to 2110 million in fiscal 2009 from 1839 million in fiscal 2008 our operating margin during fiscal 2009 was 339 up 190 basis points from 320 a year ago primarily due to favorable currency rates cost saving initiatives and incremental stockbased compensation in the prior year since 97 of our asv is billed in us dollars the strengthening of the us dollar year over year improved our operating margin 220 basis points foreign currency reduced 

  

our operating expenses by 138 million and increased operating income by 136 million during fiscal 2009 while both the euro and british pound sterling have gained significantly on the us dollar since may 2009 the impact on our expense base will not be immediate our currency risk is hedged 90 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and 45 through the second quarter of fiscal 2010 cost saving initiatives covered a range of operational areas including implementing more cost effective means to connect clients to our data centers data cost reductions from renegotiating terms with vendors review of usage data for royaltybased payments implementing an approval process to encourage a more judicious approach to interoffice travel reducing the number of expatriot assignments improving our marketing spend efficiency and using the capabilities of a laptop to eliminate the need to purchase a phone for every employee included in fiscal 2008 was a pretax charge of 24 million related to an increase in the estimate of the number of performancebased stock options that vested in august 2008 the change in the estimate increased operating expenses by 24 million in the year ago period and decreased operating margins by 40 basis points 

partially offsetting the benefit from favorable currency rates cost saving initiatives and incremental stockbased compensation in the prior year was a full year of factset fundamentals factset fundamentals expenses in fiscal 2009 were primarily compensation from new employee growth to support the fundamental collection operation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and prepaid daily database updates operating income declined 75 million from factset fundamentals which reduced the fiscal 2009 operating margin by 120 basis points 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

in fiscal 2008 operating income was up 19 from 1551 million in fiscal 2007 our operating margin decreased 60 basis points in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to increased employee compensation and data costs partially offset by lower computer maintenance and amortization of intangible assets fiscal 2008 included a pretax charge of 24 million related to an increase in the estimate of the number of performancebased stock options that vested in august 2008 and one month of factset fundamentals which decreased operating income by 11 million factset fundamentals expenses in fiscal 2008 were primarily amortization of acquired intangible assets and prepaid daily database updates 

operating income by segment 

 

 each segment records compensation including stockbased compensation amortization of intangible assets depreciation of furniture and fixtures amortization of leasehold improvements communication costs professional fees rent expense travel marketing office and other direct expenses related to its employees expenditures associated with our data centers product development and corporate headquarters charges are recorded by the us segment and are not allocated to the european and asia pacific segments 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

operating income from our us segment increased 15 to 1429 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 1240 million in the same period a year ago primarily due to a 6 increase in revenues lower us variable data fees a decline in te costs and a reduction in sga employee compensation partially offset by higher computer related expenses lower data costs were caused by a reduction in variable fees charged by data vendors based on deployment of their content over the factset platform sga employee compensation expressed as a percentage of us revenues decreased during fiscal 2009 compared to the same period a year ago due to reduced headcount growth in the us the decrease in te costs was primarily due to a prudent approach to interoffice travel and the occurrence of our engineering conference only in the prior year as mentioned above expenditures associated with our data centers including computer related expenses are recorded by the us segment and are not allocated to the european and asia pacific segments the increase in computer related expenses relates to last year’s transition to hewlett packard integrity mainframe machines in our data centers computer maintenance expenses rose because maintenance commences one year after a mainframe is deployed due to the expiration of the warranty computer depreciation also increased because no mainframe machines became fully depreciated during the year 

european operating income increased 25 to 476 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 381 million in the same period a year ago primarily due to an 11 increase in revenues and a decrease in te costs european revenues advanced 11 to 1566 million largely related to offering a broader selection of global content and the continued deployment of our portfolio analysis risk and quantitative applications the decrease in te costs for the european segment was primarily due to a prudent approach to our interoffice travel and a decrease in the cost per trip 

  

asia pacific operating income decreased 6 to 205 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 218 million in the same period a year ago primarily due to a full year of operations for factset fundamentals and increased rent expense for office expansion in japan india and the philippines partially offset by a 15 increase in revenues 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

operating income from our us segment increased 23 to 1240 million during fiscal 2008 compared to 1009 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 19 increase in revenues and lower computer maintenance and amortization of intangible assets european operating income decreased 1 to 381 million during fiscal 2008 compared to 385 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to higher employee compensation and data costs partially offset by a 23 increase in revenues asia pacific operating income increased 39 to 218 million during fiscal 2008 compared to 157 million in fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 38 increase in revenues 

other income income taxes net income and earnings per share 

 

 other income 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

other income declined 79 to 11 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period a year ago the decline in other income was a result of the federal reserve lowering us interest rates by 220 basis points over the last twelve months which lowered returns on our investments in us treasuries and us government agency securities at no time during fiscal 2009 did a component of our investment portfolio experience a decline in value due to a ratings change default or increase in counterparty credit risk 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

other income decreased 34 to 52 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the decline in other income was a result of the federal reserve lowering us interest rates by 350 basis points in fiscal 2008 and our reallocation of investments to us treasuries and us government agency securities at no time during fiscal 2008 did a component of our investment portfolio experience a decline in value due to a ratings change default or increase in counterparty credit risk 

income taxes 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

in fiscal 2009 the provision for income taxes increased 5 to 672 million as compared to the same period a year ago our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 317 compared to 339 for the prior year the components of the effective tax rate are 336 for the full fiscal 2009 year partially offset by income tax benefits of 19 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 decreased 220 basis points as compared to fiscal 2008 due to 40 million of income tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2009 from the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit in october 2008 retroactive to january 1 2008 finalizing our prior year tax returns a tax credit for repatriating foreign earnings to the us and adjusting certain reserves to reflect the lapse of statute of limitations 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

the provision for income taxes advanced 20 in fiscal 2008 from 533 million in fiscal 2007 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 339 compared to 327 for the prior year our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 increased 120 basis points as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily from the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit on december 31 2007 which caused our effective tax rate to increase 190 basis points in fiscal 2008 

net income and earnings per share 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

net income rose 16 to 1449 million and diluted earnings per common share increased 19 to 297 in fiscal 2009 compared to the year ago period included in fiscal 2009 was a 003 per share benefit from the reenactment of the us federal rd credit in october 2008 a 006 per share benefit related to finalizing prior years’ tax returns and repatriating foreign earnings to the us and a 003 per share benefit from incremental stockbased compensation in the prior year 

  

related to performancebased options partially offset by a 009 per share reduction in diluted earnings per share from factset fundamentals factset fundamentals expenses in fiscal 2009 were primarily compensation from new employee growth to support the fundamental collection operation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and prepaid daily database updates 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

net income rose 14 to 1250 million and diluted earnings per common share increased 17 to 250 in fiscal 2008 compared to the year ago period included in net income for fiscal 2008 was a pretax charge of 24 million related to an increase in the number of performancebased stock options that vested in august 2008 and the impact of factset fundamentals which reduced operating income by 11 million in fiscal 2008 the inclusion of these expenses decreased net income by 35 million or 3 year over year 

foreign currency 

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity transaction gains losses that arise from the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in determining net income for the period in which exchange rates change 

as depicted in the chart below our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 18 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 119 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 101 million per year 

 

 our primary foreign currency exchange exposures are related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where 55 of our employees are located during the last twelve months the us dollar strengthened particularly against the british pound sterling and euro foreign currency movements had the following effects in fiscal 2009 when holding currencies constant from fiscal 2008 

 

  

  

  

 to reduce shortterm variability in operating expenses denominated in british pound sterling and euro from foreign currency fluctuations we entered into foreign currency forward contracts with maturities up to twelve months during fiscal 2009 these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over longer time horizons during fiscal 2009 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge approximately 90 of our net foreign currency exposure through the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and 45 of our net exposure in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 in designing a specific hedging approach we considered several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures forecasting risk and potential ineffectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements 

at august 31 2009 the aggregated notional amount of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was 262 million these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss on the forward contract is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income and then reclassified into operating income when the hedged exposure affects operating income when net expenses are recorded 

  

the following is a summary of all hedging positions held as of august 31 2009 in thousands 

 

 a loss on derivatives for the twelve months ended august 31 2009 of 52 million was recorded into operating income in our consolidated statements of income compared to a gain of 03 million in the same period a year ago the fair value of all derivative instruments recorded in our consolidated statement of financial condition at august 31 2009 was 11 million in other current assets compared to 02 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses at august 31 2008 included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss was 09 million net of tax at august 31 2009 compared to 02 million net of tax at august 31 2008 

liquidity 

the table below for the periods indicated provides selected cash flow information in thousands 

 

  

  

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 2163 million or 34 of our total assets at august 31 2009 compared with 1180 million or 20 of our total assets at august 31 2008 all of our operating and capital expenditure requirements were financed entirely from cash generated from our operations our cash and cash equivalents increased 983 million in fiscal 2009 as a result of cash provided by operations of 2078 million 253 million of proceeds from the sale of investments and 238 million from the exercise of employee stock options partially offset by cash outflows of 1038 million related to stock repurchases dividends paid of 348 million and capital expenditures of 214 million net of landlord contributions for construction of 26 million 

we historically pay variable employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year in the first fiscal quarter this cash outlay is anticipated to be approximately 32 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we have included the payout in accrued compensation on our balance sheet at august 31 2009 variable employee compensation paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was 315 million relating to fiscal 2008 

  

during fiscal 2009 free cash flow rose 71 to 1837 million and exceeded net income by 27 drivers of free cash flow during fiscal 2009 were increased levels of net income execution on cost savings initiatives positive working capital changes favorable currency rates and a reduction in capital expenditures the improvement in working capital was primarily from a 12 million or 16 decrease in accounts receivable over the last 12 months our accounts receivable balance decreased 16 while revenues grew 8 at august 31 2009 our days sales outstanding “dso” was 37 days as compared to 44 days at august 31 2008 

net cash provided by investing activities improved by 1205 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the acquisitions of thomson fundamentals and dealmaven in fiscal 2008 and lower capital expenditures there were no business acquisitions during fiscal 2009 

net cash used in financing activities advanced 50 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to incremental share repurchases and an increase in the dividends paid per share during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 22 million shares for 1033 million under the program on may 12 2009 our board of directors approved an 11 increase in the regular quarterly dividend from 018 per share to 020 per share or 080 per share per annum beginning with our dividend payment in june 2009 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 1180 million or 20 of our total assets at august 31 2008 compared with 1688 million or 32 of our total assets at august 31 2007 all our operating and capital expense requirements were financed entirely from cash generated from our operations our cash and cash equivalents decreased 508 million since august 31 2007 as a result of cash outflows of 779 million related to stock repurchases 290 million from the payment of variable employee compensation 759 million from the acquisitions of thomson fundamentals and dealmaven dividends paid of 258 million and capital expenditures net of landlord contributions of 348 million partially offset from cash provided by operations of 1431 million and 301 million from the exercise of employee stock options 

free cash flow was 1073 million in fiscal 2008 drivers of free cash flow during fiscal 2008 were net income of 1250 million and noncash expenses of 298 million partially offset by capital expenditures of 348 million and a decrease in working capital of 127 million the decrease in cash flows from working capital changes was primarily caused by an increase in accounts receivable 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2008 decreased 128 million or 8 since fiscal 2007 as a result of the prepayment of daily database updates to thomson in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 on july 24 2008 we entered into a transition services agreement “tsa” with thomson whereby thomson provides services for 18 months from july 24 2008 including daily updates to our fundamentals database the cost of the tsa was approximately 9 million of which 825 million was consideration for the daily database updates expensed ratably over the 18month period 

net cash used in investing activities increased 793 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the acquisitions of thomson fundamentals and dealmaven partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures there were no business acquisitions during fiscal 2007 

net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2008 was consistent with fiscal 2007 

capital resources 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 214 million net of landlord contributions for construction of 26 million for fiscal 2009 down from 348 million in the same period a year ago approximately 111 million or 52 of capital expenditures was for computer equipment including the purchase of additional hewlett packard integrity mainframes to increase the processing speed of our data centers the remaining 48 or 103 million of capital expenditures net of landlord contributions for construction was for the buildout of new space in our new york boston norwalk hyderabad and manila office locations as well as additional furnishing of our london and norwalk offices capital spending levels decreased compared to the prior year due to improvements in hardware utilization and landlord contributions received to fund the buildout of new office space in new york boston norwalk and manila 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 totaled 348 million net of landlord contributions for construction of 10 million a decrease of 16 million or 4 compared to fiscal 2007 expenditures for computer equipment were 243 million and the remainder covered office space expansion significant capital expenditures included adding hewlett packard integrity mainframe machines to our data centers and building out new office space in our paris amsterdam chicago and norwalk locations as a result our system capacity expanded by 20 the cost per integrity mainframe is 35 less than an alpha mainframe and the power consumption has been reduced in half the additional purchases in fiscal 2008 completed our transition to hewlett packard integrity mainframes in our data centers well ahead of schedule 

  

capital needs 

we currently have no outstanding indebtedness other than the letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as discussed below 

in march 2008 we renewed our threeyear credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank the credit facility is available in an aggregate principal amount of up to 125 million for working capital and general corporate purposes maturing on march 31 2011 approximately 34 million of the credit facility has been utilized for standby letters of credit issued during the ordinary course of business as of august 31 2009 we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility at a weighted average annual rate of 0125 the facility also contains covenants that among other things require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios 

as of august 31 2009 and 2008 we maintained a zero debt balance and were in compliance with all associated covenants 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk as of august 31 2009 2008 or 2007 

contractual obligations 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2009 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 

 

  

  

  

 purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations 

  

expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations 

share repurchase program 

on march 16 2009 our board of directors approved an expansion of the existing share repurchase program by an additional 100 million during fiscal 2009 we repurchased 22 million shares for 1033 million under the program including the expansion 102 million remains authorized for future share repurchases as of august 31 2009 repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations 

we expect that for the next year our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow in addition we may use cash to fund other acquisitions repurchase additional common stock or invest in other businesses when opportunities arise based upon the predominance of our revenues from recurring sources and current expectations we believe that our cash and cash equivalents cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend payments stock repurchases and financing activities for the next year 

on january 25 2008 our board of directors approved an expansion of the existing share repurchase program by an additional 125 million at that time we completed the 100 million expansion to the existing share repurchase program authorized by the board on march 19 2007 repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 13 million shares for 77 million under the program at august 31 2008 105 million remained authorized for future share repurchases 

dividends 

on may 12 2009 our board of directors approved an 11 increase in the regular quarterly dividend beginning with our dividend payment in june 2009 of 020 per share or 080 per share per annum the cash dividend of 94 million was paid on june 16 2009 to common stockholders of record on may 29 2009 on august 13 2009 a regular quarterly dividend of 020 per share was announced the cash dividend was paid on september 15 2009 to common stockholders of record on august 31 2009 future cash dividends will be paid using our existing and future cash generated by operations 

critical accounting estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and ii changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

receivable reserves 

our client base has generally been of a high quality and as such we have not historically experienced a high level of creditrelated writeoffs aged client receivables are analyzed each month and our collection efforts are directed accordingly we review recent history of client receivable writeoffs analyze trends in aged client receivables and general market conditions to estimate our accounts receivable reserve in accordance with this policy our receivable reserve was 17 million as of august 31 2009 and 2008 respectively actual cancellations and billing adjustments could differ from those estimated amounts and could have an impact on the financial statements of higher or lower expense a 10 change in actual cancellations and billing adjustments during fiscal 2009 and 2008 would have affected our receivable reserves by approximately 01 million in both years 

  

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information we determined that there were three reporting units during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 which are consistent with the operating segments reported because there is no discrete financial information available for the subsidiaries within each operating segment our reporting units evaluated for potential impairment during fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 were us europe and asia pacific which reflects the level of internal reporting we use to manage our business and operations we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each of fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 and determined that there had been no impairment the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2009 was 1814 million 

we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income and a writedown of the related asset 

depreciable lives of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

the net book value of our property equipment and leasehold improvements at august 31 2009 was 884 million representing 14 of our consolidated total assets depreciation expense for the year ended august 31 2009 was 261 million or 6 of total operating expenses management’s judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 

property equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets’ estimated useful lives on a straightline basis for financial reporting purposes the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by us and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets technological life cycles and scheduled enhancements and upgrades a residual value is estimated at the time of asset acquisition and evaluated on a continual basis and as circumstances warrant the determination of a residual value is the anticipated fair market value of the acquired asset at the date of disposal or sale based on available market conditions circumstances and events relating to these assets such as system upgrades are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives residual values and impairments see “longlived assets” below are identified and prospective depreciation expense is adjusted or an impairment charge recorded accordingly 

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment leasehold improvements and identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2009 was 1347 million 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows we have not made any material changes in our impairment 

  

loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and section 199 deductions our effective tax rate was 317 339 and 327 in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

effective at the beginning of the first quarter of 2008 we adopted fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement 109  which provides a comprehensive model for the recognition measurement and disclosure in financial statements of uncertain income tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return under fin 48 we can recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is “morelikelythannot” that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination based solely on the technical merits of the tax position as of the reporting date otherwise no benefit can be recognized the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we will classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash within one year additionally we accrue interest and related penalties if applicable on all tax exposures for which reserves have been established consistent with jurisdictional tax laws interest and penalties are classified as income tax expense in the financial statements at adoption companies must adjust their financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are morelikelythannot to be sustained as of the adoption date any necessary adjustment is recorded directly to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption and reported as a change in accounting principle as a result of the adoption of fin 48 we reduced current taxes payable by 02 million and increased noncurrent deferred tax assets by 11 million the adoption of fin 48 was accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and accordingly increased retained earnings by 13 million see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as of august 31 2009 we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 64 million including 10 of accrued interest recorded as noncurrent taxes payable in the statement of financial condition unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements if recognized essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income audits by five tax authorities are currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by lower earnings than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher earnings than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the postacquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations of them significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in fin 48 in addition fin 48 applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain ongoing 

  

employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

accrued compensation 

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 20 of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary employee compensation we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate the amount of the variable employee compensation recorded within accrued compensation as of august 31 2009 was 320 million 

investment impairments 

we maintain a portfolio of investments that is managed to preserve principal pursuant to our investment guidelines established our investments attempt to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification the weighted average duration of our portfolios is managed not to exceed two years eligible investments include obligations issued by the us treasury and other governmental agencies money market securities and highly rated commercial paper to be held in the custody of major financial institutions investments such as puts calls strips straddles short sales options futures commodities precious metals or investments on margin are not permitted under our investment guidelines all investments are denominated in us dollars we did not hold any investments as of august 31 2009 

we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments below the cost basis is judged to be otherthantemporary we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income there were no impairment charges on our investments during fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 our cash and investment portfolio did not experience any significant realized or unrealized losses as a result of counterparty credit risk or ratings change during fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 

stockbased compensation 

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which includes sharebased payment awards to employees a nonemployee director’s plan and an employee stock purchase plan see note 12 and note 13 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for a complete discussion of our stockbased compensation programs 

we account for stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas 123r sharebased payment  sfas 123r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values of the share awards that are scheduled to vest during the period 

the following table summarizes stockbased compensation expense under sfas 123r for the twelve months ended august 31 2009 2008 and 2007 in thousands 

 

 stockbased compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of income during fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based primarily on historical experience 

  

we determine the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant using a latticebinomial model we review our assumptions to determine the fair value of stockbased compensation awards optionpricing models require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price expected dividend yield future option forfeitures and future employee stock option exercise behaviors changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

performancebased stock options 

performancebased stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets the number of performancebased options that vest will be predicated on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years subsequent to the grant date dependent on the financial performance levels attained by us during the two subsequent fiscal years 0 20 60 or 100 of the performancebased stock options will vest to the grantees of those stock options there is no current guarantee however that such options will vest in whole or in part 

august 2006 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2006 we granted 924989 performancebased employee stock options during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we estimated that it was probable we would achieve organic asv and diluted earnings per share growth of at least 20 on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended august 31 2008 this reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that was estimated to vest at the end of fiscal 2008 the change in estimate required us to record a pretax charge of 24 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and resulted in stockbased compensation expense of 31 million to be recognized over the next three years as of august 31 2008 we achieved organic asv and diluted earnings per share growth of at least 20 on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended august 31 2008 and as such 60 of the initial 924989 performancebased employee stock options granted will vest and the remainder were recorded as forfeitures 

august 2007 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2007 we granted 896194 performancebased employee stock options none of these performancebased stock options granted will vest because we did not achieve certain performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2009 these performancebased options were recorded as forfeitures in august 2009 

august 2008 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2008 we granted 1058981 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that vest is based on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2010 at august 31 2009 we estimated that none of the performancebased stock options will vest this results in zero unamortized stockbased compensation expense as of august 31 2009 our estimate considers the current difficult economic conditions and the potential adverse impact on many of our clients from the dislocation in the global equity and credit markets a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by us could result in the following changes to our current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands 

 

  

 new accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption which we include here by reference 

  

recent market trends 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving equity foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations since september 1 2008 major equity indices eg dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp 500 and nasdaq composite have experienced declines greater than 15 coupled with increased levels of volatility a prolonged decline in the equity markets could impact the size and buying power of many of our clients 

we derive 82 of our revenues from investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management an equity market decline not only depresses assets under management but could cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in lower demand for services from investment managers 

while increased use of our services among hedge funds is not a significant driver of our recent revenue growth we do have more hedge fund clients today than three years ago the decline in the equity markets could increase the normal rate of hedge fund closures and increase asset redemption rates in the near term many hedge funds rely on performance fees and utilize leverage in addition the rate of closure related to small hedge funds may increase if they were relying on performance fees to cover operating costs 

our sellside clients account for approximately 18 of our revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the credit crisis that began in august 2007 continues to impact many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients such as bear stearns lehman brothers merrill lynch and wachovia were purchased by other firms as their viability as standalone entities came into question more of our clients could encounter similar problems the recent lack of confidence in the global banking system caused declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt additional turmoil consolidation and business failures in the global investment banking sector could adversely affect factset’s financial results and future growth 

we service equity research and ma departments these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a larger percentage of the overall revenues of our clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they deleverage their balance sheets and adjust their expense bases to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma and equity research to compensate for the issues created by other departments 

historically the correlation between the results of our operations and the performance of the global equity markets has not been one to one today we believe that our market opportunity may be 10 times our current size even if the global equity markets which we service shrink by 15 difficult market conditions may increase the value of our ability to consolidate services for clients including deploying realtime news and quotes and may help advance the sales of proprietary content

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity transaction gains losses that arise from the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in determining net income for the period in which exchange rates change 

our nonus dollar denominated revenues expected to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 18 million while our nonus dollar denominated expenses are 119 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 101 million per year to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase to limit our exposure related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we may continue to utilize foreign currency forward contracts see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional analysis of our foreign currency exchange rate risk 

interest rate risk 

the fair market value of our cash and investment portfolio at august 31 2009 was 216 million our cash and investments portfolio is invested in us treasury money market funds and us government agency securities it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment policy dictates that the weighted average duration of shortterm investments may not exceed two years our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options commodities precious metals futures or investments on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low we do not believe that the value or liquidity of our cash and investments have been significantly impacted by the recent credit crisis 

equity price risk 

we are exposed to various economic and financial risks associated with equity and foreign currency markets as well as risks related to interest rate fluctuations during the normal course of business the major equity indices for example dow jones industrials russell 1000 nasdaq composite msci eafe and sp 500 have experienced significant volatility during the past five years since september 1 2008 the major equity indices have declined by more than 15 with increased levels of volatility the demand for our solutions could be disproportionately affected by the recent downturns in the global equity and credit markets which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for integrated financial information and analytical applications software to support the global investment community continued volatility in general economic and market conditions is still possible in the near future a continued decline in the worldwide markets could adversely impact a significant number of our clients primarily investment management firms and investment banks and increase the likelihood of personnel and spending reductions among our existing and potential clients in addition we monitor our clients’ credit worthiness and we believe that our current group of clients are credit worthy and represent no abnormal business risk

portfolio analytics— demand for the portfolio analytics suite of applications continues to rise this suite is comprehensive and includes the applications for portfolio attribution risk management and quantitative analysis portfolio analysis continued to be the cornerstone of the offering to investment management clients and represents the largest revenue contributing component of the suite at august 31 2008 there were over 637 clients representing approximately 5730 users who subscribed to this service a user increase of 22 over the prior year 

one of the key features of the suite’s central application portfolio analysis is an attribution analysis report that enables portfolio managers to dissect and explain the performance of a portfolio through time for many years factset’s primary focus has been equity portfolios – those that are comprised of stock holdings of publicly traded companies factset’s desire to enhance the attribution module to cover virtually all asset classes including corporate and sovereign debt and sophisticated derivative securities such as mortgagebacked securities and credit default swaps was a major factor in acquiring derivative solutions in august 2005 the acquisition has enabled the company to deliver an enhanced multiasset class attribution module which creates new markets for its products and a potentially strong competitive advantage in the industry 

factset’s portfolio analytics suite was also enhanced through further integration of msci barra’s products the release of an application to conduct portfolio simulation new enhancements to its portfolio publishing tools and release of portfolio dashboard monitoring tools 

during fiscal 2008 factset’s wireless capabilities were also enhanced to give users access to market company and portfolio information through blackberries factset wireless 20 delivers news quotes and customized global market and company intelligence in real time to users’ handheld devices

for factset’s sellside clients factset released new or expanded versions of the factset private equity factset people and factset corporate new issue databases in fiscal 2008 

data centers 

factset’s business is dependent on its ability to process rapidly and efficiently substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 the company completed its upgrade from hewlett packard “hp” alpha mainframe machines to hp integrity mainframe machines the company currently deploys 17 hp integrity mainframe machines in each of its data centers the hp integrity mainframe machines improve overall data and transaction processing performance by 20 increased the number of available users per machine capacity by 20 reduced power consumption by a half and lowered ownership costs by at least 35 or 03 million per integrity mainframe machine in addition each hp integrity mainframe machine is 60 smaller than an alpha mainframe machine thus reducing the company’s required data center floor space the company upgraded every mainframe in a 12month time period compared to the average lifespan of three years thus incurred accelerated computer depreciation in addition significant internal engineering resources were temporarily reassigned to ensure timely completion of the transition the company has also established a vast private wide area network to provide clients access to the company’s data centers 

  

factset’s wide area network provides a highspeed direct link between the client’s local network and the data content and powerful applications found on the company’s mainframes

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

 

   




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 

factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the following factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect its stock price 

a global market crisis and related economic recession may affect factset’s revenues and liquidity 

since september 1 2008 major equity indices eg dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp 500 and nasdaq composite have experienced declines greater than 25 coupled with increased levels of volatility since january 1 2008 this decline has been greater than 35 a prolonged decline in equity indices of developed markets could impact the size and buying power of many of factset’s clients 

factset derives 79 of its revenues from investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management “aum” an equity market decline not only depresses aum but can cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in certain investment management clients to cancel products 

while increased use of factset services among hedge funds is not a significant driver of factset’s recent revenue growth factset does have more hedge fund clients today than three years ago the recent steep decline in the equity markets could increase the normal rate of hedge fund closures and increase asset redemption rates in the near term many hedge funds rely on performance fees and utilize leverage the cost of capital leverage has spiked as evidenced by the libor rates doubling since september 2008 in addition the rate of closure related to small hedge funds may increase if they were relying on performance fees to cover operating costs 

factset’s sellside clients account for 21 of its revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the credit crisis that began in august 2007 has deepened and continues to plague many of the company’s large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients such as bear stearns lehman brothers merrill lynch and wachovia recently were purchased by other firms as their viability as a standalone entities came under question more factset clients could encounter similar problems the recent lack of confidence in the global banking system has frozen credits markets and caused declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt it is unknown how long credit markets will remain dysfunctional 

factset services equity research and ma departments these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a large percentage of the overall revenues of factset clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they delever their balance sheets and adjust their expense base to future revenue opportunities factset revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma and equity research to compensate for the problems created by other departments that over extended the available capital of banks 

historically the correlation between the results of factset’s operations and the performance of the global equity markets has not been one to one regardless of the market cycle factset has consistently grown revenues including every quarter sequentially for the past 20 years including the last 12 years as a public company today factset’s market opportunity is 15 times its current size even if the global equity markets which it services shrinks by 15 difficult market conditions may increase the value of factset’s ability to consolidate services including deploying marquee and may help advance the sales of proprietary content when factset is the low cost provider 

factset must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to maintain its leading technological position 

the market for the company’s products is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards new products based on new technologies or new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products or product enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s 

  

new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis or at all and the company’s new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements in addition the company’s ability to develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors including certain system software vendors database vendors and development tool vendors if the products of such vendors have design defects or flaws are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction or are unavailable on acceptable terms the company’s business could be seriously harmed 

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

many of factset’s products and services as well as its internal systems and processes involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including client portfolios factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation misappropriation of client data by an employee or an external third party could occur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business breaches of the company’s security measures could expose factset its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and liability for the company as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company’s brand and reputation 

a prolonged or recurring outage at one of factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to seek to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations in addition factset maintains insurance for some such events however the insurance factset carries is likely not to be sufficient to compensate the company fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such material events in addition a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

factset’s ability to integrate and market factset fundamentals as a high quality asset and win new clients 

factset fundamentals is projected to be dilutive to earnings per share in fiscal 2009 and accretive in fiscal 2010 in order to ensure accuracy of these estimates factset must build on a collection operation offshore to populate the factset fundamentals database this complex process involves hiring training and retaining approximately 500 employees and successfully deploying collection software and processes purchased from thomson reuters in addition factset must be able to market and sell factset fundamentals to new and existing clients 

factset’s ability to integrate newly acquired companies 

factset has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions from time to time acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into factset’s operations and there can be no assurances that factset will manage acquisitions successfully the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business 

under generally accepted accounting principles factset reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in its industry factset may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on its results of operations 

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing databases or products 

as a leading provider of global financial and economic information factset relies on its ability to combine more than 500 data sets into its own dedicated online service factset’s business employs a wide variety of data from a substantial number of data suppliers around the world certain of the company’s products rely on single or limited number of suppliers although factset makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact factset’s financial results and cash flows 

because approximately 34 of factset’s employees and over 25 of its leased office space are located outside the us the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on its financial results and cash flows historically the company’s primary exposures have related to nondollar denominated sales and expenses in europe and japan this exposure has increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to the year ago period primarily because the percentage of factset revenues invoiced and paid in nonus dollars has decreased due to the conversion of historical jcf eurobased paying clients to us dollarbased clients a decrease in the value of the dollar increases operating expenses from time to time factset enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations factset’s attempt to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations 

increased competition in factset’s industry that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products its competitors range in size from multibillion dollar companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized while the company believes the breadth of its businesses and product portfolio offers benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with factset in addition barriers to entry to create a single purpose product are generally low the internet as a distribution channel and noncommercial software model described above has reduced barriers to entry even further these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income weak economic conditions also can result in clients’ seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources 

factset’s ability to achieve its historical levels of profitability and growth rates for revenues earnings per share and cash flows 

factset has established revenues earnings per share and cash flow growth targets for fiscal 2009 its growth is dependent upon successfully executing its strategy the company’s initiatives and investments may not be sufficient to achieve and maintain such growth targets a failure to reach and maintain its desired revenue growth or its earnings per share growth targets could have a material adverse affect on the market value of its common stock 

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights 

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms require factset to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients including contractual provisions under various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

factset defends its intellectual property rights and combats unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of its rights is difficult while these activities adversely affect us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us could be more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

factset’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for technical personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships 

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

factset is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of its business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws 

  

regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact the company’s result of operations and financial condition in future periods factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its provision for income taxes and cash tax liability based on the results of an audit or litigation a material effect on its income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

factset’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by lower than anticipated earnings in countries where the company has lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where factset has higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof 

changes in accounting may affect factset’s reported earnings and operating income 

generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of its business are highly complex and involve subjective judgments 

changes in accounting rules their interpretation or changes in the company’s products or business could significantly change its reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures without a comparable underlying change in cash flows from operations 

in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements factset uses certain estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and management’s knowledge of current events and actions that factset may undertake in the future significant estimates have been made in areas that include income and other taxes useful lives of fixed assets and intangibles accrued liabilities accrued compensation stockbased compensation receivable reserves contingent liabilities and allocation of purchase price to assets and liabilities acquired in addition factset makes certain estimates under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 ac counting for contingencies  including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion and therefore actual results may differ 

internal controls may be ineffective 

effective internal controls are necessary to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 factset is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in its implementation its business and operating results could be harmed factset could fail to meet its reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on its stock price

at august 31 2007 client count was 1953 a net increase of 168 clients or 9 over the prior 12 months the ability to consolidate multiple services into one through the factset platform has been a compelling opportunity for firms to recognize efficiencies there were 35000 users as of august 31 2007 up 174 from 29800 at the end of fiscal 2006 advanced applications such as marquee and ibcentral contributed to the increase in the number of factset users 

our client retention remained at a rate in excess of 95 during each of the past three fiscal years confirming breadth and depth of a product suite that is deployed to a high quality institutional client base no individual client accounted for more than 3 of total asv as of august 31 2008 asv from the ten largest clients was 17 of total client subscriptions as of august 31 2008 

operating expenses 

 

 cost of services 

cost of services advanced 25 to 1912 million in fiscal 2008 from 1528 million in fiscal 2007 cost of services increased 26 in fiscal 2007 from 1214 million in fiscal 2006 cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 110 basis points to 332 during fiscal 2008 from 321 a year ago the increase was driven by higher employee compensation and additional data costs partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets and computer maintenance the main drivers of the 2007 growth of 80 basis points were increases in employee compensation and data costs partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets 

employee compensation and benefits for our software engineering and consulting departments increased 16 as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2008 compared to the same period a year ago employee additions as well as normal merit increases primarily accounted for the rise in employee compensation employee count as of august 31 2008 was 1934 up 17 over the prior year data costs as a percentage of revenues rose by 07 in fiscal 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago the increase was driven by variable payments to data vendors from additional content subscriptions and higher levels of proprietary data content collection 

a reduction in computer maintenance and amortization of intangible assets partially offset the overall increase to cost of services in fiscal 2008 computer maintenance as a percentage of revenues decreased 05 in fiscal 2008 compared to the same period a year ago the decrease in computer maintenance is a result of replacing the older existing hewlett packard alpha mainframe machines with new hewlett packard integrity mainframe machines in fiscal 2008 intangible asset amortization expense as a percentage of revenues declined 03 in fiscal 2008 compared to the same period in fiscal 2007 due to the full amortization of certain intangible assets from previous acquisitions compared to previous years 

employee compensation and benefits advanced 06 as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2007 new employees as well as normal merit increases primarily accounted for the rise in employee compensation additionally the increase in data costs in 2007 compared to 2006 of 06 as a percentage of revenues was from incremental royalty payments to data suppliers and expanding our coverage of proprietary content 

a decrease in the amortization of intangible assets partially offset these component increases of cost of services in fiscal 2007 amortization expense as a percentage of revenues declined 05 during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to a decline in acquisition activity compared to previous years and intangible assets became fully amortized 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses advanced 19 to 2004 million in fiscal 2008 from 1679 million in fiscal 2007 sga rose 16 in 2007 from 1447 million during fiscal 2006 however sga expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues declined to 348 in fiscal 2008 compared to 353 a year ago the decrease of 50 basis points in sga as a percentage of revenues was driven by lower employee compensation costs and occupancy expense partially offset by an increase in stockbased compensation sga expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased 210 basis points in fiscal 2007 compared to the same period a year ago due to lower compensation costs and a reduction in occupancy and miscellaneous expenses 

  

employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenues decreased 05 in fiscal 2008 compared to the year ago period due to the ability to leverage sga staff through our enhanced internal information systems which allowed us to keep our sga headcount growth consistent with last year while growing our revenue base occupancy costs including rent and depreciation of furniture and fixtures as a percentage of revenues decreased 03 during fiscal 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago lower occupancy costs were the result of leveraging our existing space and is temporary based on the timing of acquiring new space to support a growing employee base 

partially offsetting the overall decrease to sga as a percentage of revenues was an increase in stockbased compensation to reflect the 18 million incremental charge to sga from performancebased stock options during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we estimated that it was probable we would achieve asv and diluted earnings per share growth of at least 20 on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended august 31 2008 this reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that vest at the end of fiscal 2008 and the stockbased compensation to record 

in fiscal 2007 occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 09 as compared to the year ago period in fiscal 2006 there was redundant office space during the time our european headquarters was under construction our new european headquarters located in london opened on june 19 2006 excluding the 27 million charge for redundant office space in fiscal 2006 occupancy costs were consistent with the year ago period as a percentage of revenues employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenues decreased 04 in fiscal 2007 compared to the year ago period was driven by keeping our sga headcount growth consistent with last year miscellaneous expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by 05 during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to consolidating corporate expenditures through a purchasing card and prior year payments related to acquisition activity 

income from operations and operating margin 

operating income advanced 19 to 1839 million in fiscal 2008 from 1551 million in 2007 in fiscal 2007 operating income was up 28 from 1213 million in fiscal 2006 our operating margins in fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 were 320 326 and 313 respectively the decrease in operating margin in fiscal 2008 resulted from increases in employee compensation and data costs partially offset by lower computer maintenance and amortization of intangible assets however excluding the pretax charge of 24 million related to performancebased stock option expense and factset fundamentals which reduced operating income by 11 million nongaap operating margin improved to 326 for fiscal 2008 consistent with the prior year factset fundamentals expenses in fiscal 2008 were primarily amortization of acquired intangible assets and the prepaid daily database updates operating margin expansion in fiscal 2007 resulted from lower occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues a reduction in amortization of intangible assets and lower miscellaneous fees partially offset by increases in employee compensation and data costs 

other income income taxes net income and earnings per share 

 

 other income 

other income declined 66 to 52 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago the decline in other income was a result of the federal reserve lowering us interest rates by 35 over the last twelve months and our reallocation of investments to us treasuries and us government agency securities at no time during fiscal 2008 did a component of our investment portfolio experience a decline in value due to a ratings change default or increase in counterparty credit risk 

during fiscal 2007 other income grew 30 million or 64 as compared to fiscal 2006 the growth in other income was driven by higher cash and investment balances rising interest rates and shifting available cash from shortterm municipal securities to shortterm money market instruments 

  

income taxes 

for fiscal 2008 the provision for income taxes increased 20 to 640 million versus the prior year period our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 339 compared to 327 for the prior year our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 increased 120 basis points as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily from the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit on december 31 2007 which caused our effective tax rate to increase in fiscal 2008 the effective tax rate of 327 for fiscal 2007 was comprised of 346 from recurring operations and 19 of income tax benefits 

for fiscal 2007 the provision for income taxes increased 24 to 533 million versus the prior year period our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 327 compared to 342 for the prior year our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 declined 150 basis points as compared to fiscal 2006 due to 14 million of income tax benefits from the repatriation of foreign earnings to the us 11 million of benefits from recognizing a tax deduction under section 199 a benefit of 10 million from the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit in december 2007 retroactive to january 2007 and a 04 million tax credit in france partially offset by the inclusion of income tax benefits in fiscal 2006 from the conclusion of an audit of our us federal income tax returns and final settlement of previously filed tax returns 

section 199 was designed to encourage us companies to manufacture products domestically including software applications the tax relief and health care act of 2006 which was enacted in december 2006 includes the extension of the us federal rd tax credit from january 2006 through december 2007 the fiscal 2007 repatriation of foreign earnings to the us resulted in the recognition of a foreign tax credit 

excluding nonrecurring tax benefits our nongaap effective tax rates were as follows 345 in fiscal 2008 346 in fiscal 2007 and 365 in fiscal 2006 

net income and earnings per share 

net income rose 14 to 1250 million and diluted earnings per common share increased 17 to 250 in fiscal 2008 compared to the year ago period fiscal 2007 net income rose 32 to 1096 million and diluted earnings per share advanced 30 to 214 compared to fiscal 2006 excluding the pretax charge of 24 million in fiscal 2008 related to an increase in the number of performancebased stock options that vested in august 2008 and the impact of factset fundamentals which reduced operating income by 11 million in fiscal 2008 nongaap net income and nongaap diluted earnings per share advanced 17 and 20 respectively in fiscal 2008 as compared to the same period a year ago 

use of nongaap financial measures 

financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” including revenues operating expenses operating margins effective tax rates net income and diluted earnings per share have been adjusted to report nongaap financial measures that exclude 19 million of tax benefits a charge of 24 million related to an increase in the number of performancebased stock options that vested in august 2008 and the impact of acquiring thomson fundamentals in july 2008 we use these nongaap financial measures both in presenting our results to shareholders and the investment community and in our internal evaluation and management of the businesses we believe that these financial measures and the information we provide are useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tool that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals investors may benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and may also facilitate comparisons to our historical performance 

foreign currency 

certain wholly owned subsidiaries within the european and asia pacific segments operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains losses that arise from translating assets liabilities revenues and expenses of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity 

our primary foreign currency exchange exposures are related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where approximately 34 of our employees are located to limit our financial exposure related to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations we may utilize derivatives foreign currency contracts we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 

we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations during fiscal 2008 at august 31 2008 the aggregated notional amount of all foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was 47 million euros and 62 million british pounds these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges the effective 

  

portion of the derivative’s gain or loss on the forward contract is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and then reclassified into operating income when the hedged exposure affects operating income when net expenses are recorded 

as depicted in the chart below our nondollar denominated revenues to be recognized over the next twelve months are estimated to be 24 million while our nondollar denominated expenses are 117 million which translates into a net foreign currency exposure of 93 million per year 

 

 to reduce variability in operating expenses denominated in the euro and british pound we entered into foreign currency forward contracts with maturities up to six months during fiscal 2008 these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over longer time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we considered several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures forecasting risk and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the variability in operating expenses associated with currency movements primarily because our operations are in regions with stable currencies the effect of foreign currency fluctuations has not been material to our consolidated financial statements 

a gain on derivatives of 03 million was recorded in our consolidated statement of income for the twelve months ended august 31 2008 the fair value of all derivative instruments recorded in our consolidated statement of financial condition at august 31 2008 was 02 million in other current liabilities and 02 million in accumulated other comprehensive income 

acquisition of the thomson fundamentals database and related assets 

on july 24 2008 we completed the acquisition of the thomson fundamentals business pursuant to the agreement reached with thomson on april 22 2008 

fundamental data is historical financial information ie income statement balance sheet and cash flows and related underlying data from the footnotes to the financial statements the thomson fundamentals database is a preeminent global financial database with coverage of over 43000 companies and history back to 1980 and has been available and distributed by factset since 1991 

the acquisition included 20 million of annual revenues transferred from thomson to us copies of the thomson fundamental database source documents collection software documentation and collection training materials thomson fundamentals will continue as a product on our platform excluding direct acquisition costs we paid cash consideration of 586 million to thomson that was funded from cash from operations 

we believe that the transaction was valuable to us for four primary reasons 

 

  

  

  

 we also entered into a transition services agreement “tsa” with thomson under the tsa thomson provides services to factset for 18 months from the closing date including daily updates to factset’s fundamental database the daily updates are provided on the same schedule and with the same timeliness content and quality as the updates we receive for thomson fundamentals the tsa also outlines consulting and support services thomson will provide to us in order to ensure a complete understanding of the structure content and data collection processes required to deliver a production version of the database by the end of the transition period the cost of the tsa is approximately 9 million of which 825 million is consideration for the daily database updates and will be expensed ratably over the 18 month period 

we anticipate that this transaction will be dilutive to earnings per share “eps” until the 18month transition period concludes the quarterly costs of transition services on a pretax basis should approximate 16 million or 65 million for 

  

the full 2009 fiscal year these tsa costs are eliminated at the end of the 18month transition period the transaction is expected to be accretive to eps in fiscal 2010 

in summary we believe this transaction will extend our competitive advantage of providing clients choice of premium content sets over the factset system factset has no plans to alter its redistribution of the vast fundamental data offerings available on the factset service including thomson fundamentals reuters fundamentals and sp compustat ®  factset fundamentals expanded our selection for clients and is ready for sale today 

liquidity 

the table below for the periods indicated provides selected cash flow information in thousands 

 

  

  

  

 cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 1180 million or 20 of our total assets at august 31 2008 compared with 1688 million or 32 of our total assets at august 31 2007 all our operating and capital expense requirements were financed entirely from cash generated from our operations our cash and cash equivalents decreased 508 million since august 31 2007 as a result of cash outflows of 779 million related to stock repurchases 290 million from the payment of variable employee compensation 759 million from the acquisitions of thomson fundamentals and dealmaven dividends paid of 258 million and capital expenditures net of landlord contributions of 348 million partially offset from cash provided by operations of 1431 million and 301million from the exercise of employee stock options 

we historically pay variable employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year in the first fiscal quarter this cash outlay is anticipated to be approximately 32 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we have included the payout in accrued compensation on our balance sheet at august 31 2008 

during the last twelve months free cash flow was 116 million drivers of free cash flow during fiscal 2008 were record levels of net income and a 298 million increase in noncash expenses partially offset by 358 million in capital expenditures and a decrease in working capital of 34 million the decrease in cash flows from working capital changes was primarily caused by an increase in accounts receivable in each of the past two years free cash flow has approximated net income 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2008 decreased 128 million or 8 since fiscal 2007 as a result of the prepayment of daily database updates to thomson in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 on july 24 2008 we entered into a tsa with thomson whereby thomson provides services for 18 months from july 24 2008 including daily updates to our fundamentals database the cost of the tsa is approximately 9 million of which 825 million is consideration for the daily database updates expensed ratably over the 18month period 

  

net cash used in investing activities increased 793 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to the acquisitions of thomson fundamentals and dealmaven partially offset by a 35 million decrease in capital expenditures there were no business acquisitions completed during fiscal 2007 

net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2008 was consistent with the same period a year ago 

capital resources 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2008 totaled 358 million a decrease of 35 million or 9 compared to fiscal 2007 expenditures for computer equipment were 243 million and the remainder covered office space expansion significant capital expenditures included adding hewlett packard integrity mainframe machines to our data centers and building out new office space in our paris amsterdam chicago and norwalk locations as a result our system capacity has been expanded by 20 the cost per integrity mainframe is 35 less than an alpha mainframe and the power consumption has been reduced in half the additional purchases in fiscal 2008 completed our transition to hewlett packard integrity mainframes in both of our data centers well ahead of schedule 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2007 totaled 393 million up 65 from 237 million in the same period a year ago of the total capital expenditures 50 related to office expansions and the remainder was for computerrelated purchases significant capital expenditures included the buildout of new space in our london chicago new york and norwalk locations and the purchase of hewlett packard integrity mainframes to increase the processing speed of our data centers 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 totaled 237 million up from 219 million in fiscal 2005 the increase was driven by higher levels of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures from the build out of the new london headquarters for our european operations incremental data center computer equipment purchases in addition to office expansions during fiscal 2006 

capital needs 

we currently have no other outstanding indebtedness other than the letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as discussed below 

in february 2008 we renewed both our 364day revolving credit facility and our threeyear credit facility the credit facilities the “facilities” are available in an aggregate principal amount of up to 250 million for working capital and general corporate purposes with the facilities split into two equal tranches and maturing in march 2009 and 2011 approximately 46 million in aggregate of these credit facilities has been utilized for letters of credit issued during the ordinary course of business as of august 31 2008 we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facilities at a weighted average annual rate of 0125 the facilities also contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios 

on september 1 2005 we issued an unsecured floating rate note in the amount of 17 million maturing in september 2010 the note bore interest from and including september 1 2005 at the rate of one percent below libor and was payable semiannually the note was issued in accordance with the agreement for the sale and purchase of the share capital of the alphametrics business dated as of july 27 2005 among us alphametrics and other parties the note was issued in lieu of a seller’s cash entitlement the note and related interest was paid in full on december 8 2006 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk as of august 31 2008 2007 or 2006 

contractual obligations 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2008 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

 

  

  

  

 purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations 

expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations 

streamvpn limited— on september 1 2005 we acquired all the outstanding share capital of streamvpn limited now known as factset research systems limited the “alphametrics business” for aggregate consideration of 264 million including 26 million based on the level of working capital of the alphametrics business as of september 1 2005 pursuant to a definitive agreement dated july 27 2005 contingent consideration was to be payable if certain revenue targets were met during the twelvemonth period ending october 31 2006 however based on actual revenues generated by the alphametrics business during the twelvemonth period ending october 31 2006 no consideration is to be paid 

jcf group of companies— in relation to the jcf transaction up to €5000000 of contingent consideration would have been payable if certain asv targets had been met during the period november 1 2004 through may 1 2007 the asv targets were not attained and as such no contingent consideration was due at may 1 2007 

share repurchase program 

on january 25 2008 our board of directors approved an expansion of the existing share repurchase program by an additional 125 million at that time we completed the 100 million expansion to the existing share repurchase program authorized by the board on march 19 2007 repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid using 

  

existing and future cash generated by operations during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 13 million shares for 77 million under the program at august 31 2008 105 million remains authorized for future share repurchases 

on march 19 2007 our board of directors approved an expansion of the existing share repurchase program by an additional 100 million at that time 15 million remained authorized for repurchase under the june 20 2005 repurchase program repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 13 million shares for 79 million under the program at august 31 2007 57 million remains authorized for future share repurchases 

on june 20 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million of our common stock during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 320900 shares for 14 million under the share repurchase program at august 31 2006 36 million remained authorized for future share repurchases in addition 64935 shares were repurchased during fiscal 2006 representing common stock owned by employees in the employee stock ownership plan 

dividends 

on may 8 2008 our board of directors approved a 50 increase in the regular quarterly dividend from 012 per share to 018 per share or 072 per share per annum beginning with our dividend payment in june 2008 the cash dividend of 86 million was paid on june 17 2008 to common stockholders of record on may 29 2008 on august 13 2008 a regular quarterly dividend of 018 per share was announced the cash dividend was paid on september 16 2008 to common stockholders of record on august 29 2008 cash dividends will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations 

critical accounting estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1 the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

receivable reserves 

our client base has generally been of a high quality and as such we have not historically experienced a high level of creditrelated writeoffs aged client receivables are analyzed each month and our collection efforts are directed accordingly we take historical receivable writeoff experience trends in aged accounts receivable and general market conditions into consideration to estimate our accounts receivable reserve in accordance with this policy our receivable reserve was 17 million and 14 million as of august 31 2008 and 2007 respectively actual cancellations and billing adjustments could differ from those estimated amounts and could have an impact on the financial statements of higher or lower expense a 10 change in actual cancellations and billing adjustments during fiscal 2008 and 2007 would have affected our receivable reserves by approximately 01 million in both years 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each of fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 and determined that there had been no impairment the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2008 was 1878 million 

we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations 

  

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations and a writedown of the related asset 

depreciable lives of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

the net book value of our property equipment and leasehold improvements at august 31 2008 was 911 million representing 16 of the company’s consolidated total assets depreciation expense for the year ended august 31 2008 was 229 million or 6 of total operating expenses management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 

property equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets’ estimated useful lives on a straightline basis for financial reporting purposes the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets technological life cycles and scheduled enhancements and upgrades a residual value is estimated at the time of asset acquisition and evaluated on a continual basis and as circumstances warrant the determination of a residual value is the anticipated fair market value of the acquired asset at the date of disposal or sale based on available market conditions and identified buyers circumstances and events relating to these assets such as system upgrades are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives residual values and impairments see “longlived assets” below are identified and prospective depreciation expense is adjusted or an impairment charge recorded accordingly 

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment leasehold improvements and identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2008 was 1494 million 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our tax provision is an estimate based our understanding of laws in federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd and other tax credits tax audit settlements incentivestock options and section 199 deductions our effective tax rate was 339 327 and 342 in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

effective at the beginning of the first quarter of 2008 we adopted fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “fin 48” which is a change in accounting for income taxes fin 48 contains a 

  

twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes “sfas 109” the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement as a result of the adoption of fin 48 we reduced current taxes payable by 02 million and increased noncurrent deferred tax assets by 11 million the adoption of fin 48 was accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and accordingly increased retained earnings by 13 million see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as of august 31 2008 we have gross unrecognized tax benefits totaling 39 million including 09 of accrued interest recorded as noncurrent taxes payable in the statement of financial condition unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions taken on tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements if recognized essentially all of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest would be recorded as a benefit to tax expense on the consolidated statement of income an audit by one tax authority is currently ongoing significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the postacquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations thereof significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in fin 48 in addition fin 48 applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely affect our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

accrued compensation 

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 20 of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary bonus pools we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate the amount of the discretionary annual bonus recorded within accrued compensation as of august 31 2008 was 324 million 

investment impairments 

the fair market value of our investment portfolio at august 31 2008 was 250 million or 18 of the aggregated cash cash equivalents and investment balance preservation of principal is the primary goal of our investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment policy dictates that the weighted average duration of shortterm investments may not exceed two years our 

  

investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options or futures nor are we permitted to invest on margin 

we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments below the cost basis is judged to be otherthantemporary we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income there were no impairment charges on our investments during fiscal 2008 2007 or 2006 

stockbased compensation 

we have an employee stockbased compensation plan which includes sharebased payment awards to employees a nonemployee director’s plan and an employee stock purchase plan see note 12 and note 13 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for a complete discussion of our stockbased compensation programs 

the following table summarizes stockbased compensation expense under sfas 123r for the twelve months ended august 31 2008 2007 and 2006 which was allocated as follows in thousands 

 

 as stockbased compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income during fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures sfas 123r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised if necessary in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures were estimated based primarily on historical experience 

we determine the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant using a latticebinomial model we review our assumptions to determine the fair value of stockbased compensation awards optionpricing models require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price expected dividend yield future option forfeitures and future employee stock option exercise behaviors changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

performancebased stock awards 

performancebased stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving our performance targets the number of performancebased options that vest will be predicated on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years subsequent to the grant date dependent on the financial performance levels attained by us during the two subsequent fiscal years 0 20 60 or 100 of the performancebased stock options will vest to the grantees of those stock options there is no current guarantee however that such options will vest in whole or in part 

august 2006 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2006 we granted 924989 performancebased employee stock options during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we estimated that it was probable we would achieve organic asv and diluted earnings per share growth of at least 20 on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended august 31 2008 this reflected a higher performance level than previously estimated and accordingly increased the number of options that was estimated to vest at the end of fiscal 2008 the change in estimate required us to record a pretax charge of 24 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 and results in stockbased compensation expense of 31 million to be recognized over the next three years as of august 31 2008 we achieved organic asv and diluted earnings per share growth of at least 20 on a compounded annual basis for the two years ended august 31 2008 and as such 60 of the initial 924989 performancebased employee stock options granted will vest and the remainder were recorded as forfeitures 

  

august 2007 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2007 we granted 896194 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that vest is based on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2009 at august 31 2008 we estimated that none of the performancebased stock options will vest this results in zero unamortized stockbased compensation expense as of august 31 2008 our estimate considered the current environment in which many large banks are carefully managing expenses and the potential adverse impact on many of our clients from the dislocation in the global equity and credit markets a change in the financial performance levels achieved by us could result in the following changes to our current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands

august 2008 performancebased option grant review 

in august 2008 we granted 1058981 performancebased employee stock options the number of performancebased options that vest is based on us achieving performance levels for both organic asv and diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2010 at august 31 2008 we estimated that 20 or 211796 of the performancebased stock options will vest which results in stockbased compensation expense of 35 million to be recognized over the next sixty months as of august 31 2008 a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by us could result in the following changes to our current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands

recent market trends 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to financial risks involving equity foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations since september 1 2008 major equity indices eg dow jones industrials russell 1000 msci eafe sp500 and nasdaq composite have experienced declines greater than 25 coupled with increased levels of volatility since january 1 2008 this decline has been greater than 35 a prolonged decline in equity indices of developed markets could impact the size and buying power of many of our clients 

we derive 79 of our revenues from investment management clients the prosperity of these clients is tied to equity assets under management “aum” an equity market decline not only depresses aum but can cause a significant increase in redemption requests to move money out of equities and into other asset classes moreover extended declines in the equity markets may reduce new fund or client creation resulting in certain investment management clients to cancel products to fund the purchase of new services 

  

while increased use of our services among hedge funds is not a significant driver of our recent revenue growth we do have more hedge fund clients today than three years ago the recent steep decline in the equity markets could increase the normal rate of hedge fund closures and increase asset redemption rates in the near term many hedge funds rely on performance fees and utilize leverage the cost of capital leverage has spiked as evidenced by the libor rates doubling since september 2008 in addition the rate closure related to small hedge funds may increase if they were relying on performance fees to cover operating costs 

our sellside clients account for 21 of our revenues a significant portion of these revenues relate to services deployed by large bulge bracket banks the credit crisis that began in august 2007 has deepened and continues to plague many of the large banking clients due to the amount of leverage deployed in past operations clients such as bear stearns lehman brothers merrill lynch and wachovia recently were purchased by other firms as their viability as standalone entities came under question more of our clients could encounter similar problems the recent lack of confidence in the global banking system has frozen credit markets and caused declines in merger and acquisitions funded by debt it is unknown how long credit markets will remain dysfunctional 

we service equity research and ma departments these are low risk businesses that do not deploy leverage and will likely continue to operate far into the future and should represent a large percentage of the overall revenues of our clients regardless the size of banks in general is shrinking as they delever their balance sheets and adjust their expense base to future revenue opportunities our revenues may decline if banks including those involved in recent merger activity significantly reduce headcount in the areas of corporate ma and equity research to compensate for the problems created by other departments that over extended the available capital of banks 

historically the correlation between the results of our operations and the performance of the global equity markets has not been one to one regardless of the market cycle we have consistently grown revenues including every quarter sequentially for the past 20 years including the last 12 years as a public company today our market opportunity is 15 times our current size even if the global equity markets which we service shrinks by 15 difficult market conditions may increase the value of our ability to consolidate services including deploying marquee and may help advance the sales of proprietary content when we are the low cost provider

 market sensitivities 

we are exposed to various economic and financial risks associated with equity and foreign currency markets as well as risks related to interest rate fluctuations during the normal course of business the major equity indices for example dow jones industrials russell 1000 nasdaq composite msci eafe and sp 500 have experienced significant volatility during the past five years since september 1 2008 the major equity indices have declined by more than 27 with increased levels of volatility the demand for our solutions could be disproportionately affected by the recent downturns in the global equity and credit markets which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products 

continued volatility in general economic and market conditions is still possible in the near future a continued decline in the worldwide markets could adversely impact a significant number of our clients primarily investment management firms and investment banks and increase the likelihood of personnel and spending reductions among our existing and potential clients external factors such as the threat of terrorist activities or volatile energy prices could undermine the general economic environment interest rate increases adopted by the federal reserve bank continued inflationary pressures or both could hinder the economic environment and adversely affect the operations of our clients 

the fair market value of our investment portfolio at august 31 2008 was 250 million or 18 of the aggregated cash cash equivalents and investment balance it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment policy dictates that the weighted average duration of shortterm investments may not exceed two years our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options or futures nor are we permitted to invest on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low

 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 

factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the following factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect its stock price 

factset must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to maintain its leading technological position 

the market for the company’s products is characterized by rapid technological change changes in client demands and evolving industry standards new products based on new technologies or new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products or product enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis or at all and the company’s new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements in addition the company’s ability to develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors including certain system software vendors database vendors and development tool vendors if the products of such vendors have design defects or flaws are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction or are unavailable on acceptable terms the company’s business could be seriously harmed 

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

many of factset’s products and services are comprised of information delivered through a variety of media including the internet softwarebased applications and dedicated transmission lines factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in their implementation misappropriation of client data could incur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business 

  

a prolonged or recurring outage at one of factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of clients 

factset’s clients rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those of its suppliers and clients are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failures terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to seek to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations in addition factset maintains insurance for some such events however the insurance factset carries may not be sufficient to compensate the company fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events in addition a loss of the company’s services may induce its clients to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

factset’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for technical personnel in the industry in which the company competes is strong the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships 

factset’s ability to integrate newly acquired companies 

factset has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions from time to time acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into factset’s operations and there can be no assurances that factset will manage acquisitions successfully the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business 

under generally accepted accounting principles factset reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in its industry factset may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on its results of operations 

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing databases or products 

as a leading provider of global financial and economic information factset relies on its ability to combine more than 200 databases into its own dedicated online service factset’s business employs a wide variety of data from a substantial number of data suppliers around the world certain of the company’s products rely on single or limited number of suppliers although factset makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

significant changes to the financial market conditions may affect factset’s revenues 

future results could be materially adversely affected by poor performance of major financial markets including the subprime market as experienced in the summer of 2007 and reductions in expenditures by large clients the target clients for factset products include a range of financial services organizations that manage investment portfolios including asset managers investment advisors brokerage firms banks plan sponsors hedge funds and others the success of many of its clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets factset believes that demand for its solutions could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations disruptions instability or downturns in the financial services industry which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company’s revenues expenses and financial condition 

uncertain economic conditions may affect factset’s revenues 

factset conducts significant sales and client support operations in countries outside of the united states for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 factset derived 30 and 28 of its revenue respectively from outside the united states accordingly future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates political or social unrest terrorist attacks economic instability or natural disasters in a specific country or region environmental and trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect 

  

the company’s ability to import its products from export its products to or sell its products in various countries political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns health or similar issues such as the outbreak of avian influenza difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries factset believes that demand for its solutions could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations disruptions instability or downturns in the economy which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company’s revenues expenses and financial condition 

increased competition in factset’s industry that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products its competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized while the company believes the breadth of its businesses and product portfolio offers benefits to its clients that are a competitive advantage its competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry to create a single purpose product are generally low the internet as a distribution channel and noncommercial software model described above has reduced barriers to entry even further these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income weak economic conditions also can result in clients’ seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources 

factset’s ability to achieve its historical levels of profitability and growth rates for revenues earnings per share and cash flows 

factset has established revenues earnings per share and cash flow growth targets for fiscal 2008 its growth is dependent upon successfully executing its strategy the company’s initiatives and investments may not be sufficient to achieve and maintain such growth targets a failure to reach and maintain its desired revenue growth or its earnings per share growth targets could have a material adverse affect on the market value of its common stock 

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights 

factset may receive notice from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s clients including contractual provisions under various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

factset defends its intellectual property rights and combats unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of its rights is difficult while these activities adversely affect us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the us could be more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

factset is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of its business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact the company’s result of operations and financial condition in future periods factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its provision for income taxes and cash tax liability based on the results of an audit or litigation a material effect on its income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

factset’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by lower than anticipated earnings in countries where the company has lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where factset has higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof 

  

changes in accounting may affect factset’s reported earnings and operating income 

generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of its business are highly complex and involve subjective judgments 

changes in accounting rules their interpretation or changes in the company’s products or business could significantly change its reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures without a comparable underlying change in cash flows from operations 

in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements factset uses certain estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and management’s knowledge of current events and actions that factset may undertake in the future significant estimates have been made in areas that include income and other taxes useful lives of fixed assets and intangibles accrued liabilities accrued compensation stockbased compensation receivable reserves contingent liabilities and allocation of purchase price to assets and liabilities acquired in addition factset makes certain estimates under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 ac counting for contingencies  including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion and therefore actual results may differ 

internal controls may be ineffective 

effective internal controls are necessary to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” factset is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in its implementation its business and operating results could be harmed factset could fail to meet its reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on its stock price 

potential changes in securities laws and regulations governing the investment industry’s use of soft dollars may reduce factset’s revenues 

as of august 31 2007 24 of factset’s revenues are paid through soft dollar arrangements on july 18 2006 the sec issued interpretive release no 3454165 which became effective in january 2007 the release provides guidance on asset managers’ use of client commissions to pay for brokerage and research services within the scope of section 28e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the interpretive release outlines a framework for determining what types of research services fall within the safe harbor provisions of that section during a speech in the spring of 2007 sec chairman cox indicated his personal preference to eliminate the use of soft dollars although the company believes that its services fall within the description of eligible research services covered by the safe harbor that its services provide lawful and appropriate assistance to the money manager in undertaking investment decisions and that the commissions for the services are reasonable in relation to the value of the services provided nevertheless a client might arrive at a different conclusion moreover if additional rules are issued or certain interpretations are followed that narrow or eliminate the definition of research or brokerage services which results in its clients being unable to use soft dollar arrangements to pay for factset products and services the company’s revenues could decrease

revenues in fiscal 2006 increased 24 to 3874 million from 3126 million in fiscal 2005 the 24 increase in fiscal 2006 compared to the same period a year ago breaks down into 17 growth in the underlying organic business and 7 growth from acquisitions owned less than one year acquisitions during fiscal 2006 including global filings the alphametrics business and dsi accounted for 7 or 206 million of the revenue growth in the fiscal 2006 performance was driven by many product lines in all geographic regions signing on new clients kept the revenue growth rate of our us business at 21 and our international business at 32 in fiscal 2006 our ib team was the catalyst behind adding over 3000 users during fiscal 2006 and increased the appeal of our ib central application applications such as marquee our suite of portfolio analysis services deeper penetration within sell side firms and expanded content choices deepened users’ engagement with our products and caused clients users and subscriptions to increase subscriptions to databases and applications to existing clients comprised approximately half of our revenue growth new clients and users accounted for the remainder we have deployed our capital to develop a diverse product suite that attracts and engages a global institutional client base 

demand for advanced services and computing power related to risk quantitative and portfolio analysis continued throughout the client base the portfolio analytics suite is comprehensive and includes the applications for portfolio attribution risk and quantitative analysis the portfolio analysis workstation is the largest revenue contributing member of this product suite approximately 540 clients consisting of 4700 users subscribed to the pa 20 application as of august 31 2007 an increase of about 65 clients and 800 users over the prior year 

subscriptions  “subscriptions” at a given point in time represent the forwardlooking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to our clients with proper notice to us our clients are generally able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time at august 31 2007 subscriptions were 5169 million up 943 million or 223 from the prior year total of 4226 million on a constant currency basis subscriptions increased 925 million over the last twelve months up 219 subscriptions from overseas operations increased from 1263 million at august 31 2006 to 1570 million at august 31 2007 representing 30 of the companywide total subscription growth in fiscal 2007 was due to the net addition of new clients incremental subscriptions to our services by existing clients and increased users the growth in fiscal 2007 demonstrates our ability to deploy solutions to service the global needs of large institutions the performance of portfolio analytics and our ability to license our proprietary content including events and transcripts deal data and ownership data enhanced our subscription growth at august 31 2007 the average subscription per client was 265000 up from 237000 at august 31 2006 and 221000 at august 31 2005 

subscriptions at the end of fiscal 2006 were up 748 million or 22 from the prior year total of 3478 million due to the net addition of new clients incremental subscriptions to our services by existing clients and increased users on a constant currency basis and excluding the acquisition of global filings and the alphametrics business subscriptions increased 655 million or 19 since august 31 2005 

clients and users  at august 31 2007 client count was 1953 a net increase of 168 clients or 9 over the prior 12 months in fiscal 2006 clients rose by 209 on a net basis which included the net addition of 25 clients from the acquisitions of alphametrics and global filings the ability to consolidate multiple services into one through the factset platform has been a compelling opportunity for firms to recognize efficiencies 

there were approximately 35000 users as of august 31 2007 up 174 from 29800 at the end of fiscal 2006 advanced applications such as marquee 30 and ibcentral contributed to the increase in the number of factset users in fiscal 2006 factset users increased 3000 from the prior year fiscal 2006 user growth was the result of a further increase in users at our investment banking clients 

  

our client retention remained at a rate in excess of 95 during each of the past three fiscal years confirming breadth and depth of a product suite that is deployed to a high quality institutional client base no individual client accounted for more than 3 of total subscriptions as of august 31 2007 subscriptions from the ten largest clients were 18 of total client subscriptions 

revenues by geographic region  revenues from the domestic business increased 210 to 3353 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 2772 million in the same period a year ago excluding 42 million of nonsubscription revenues domestic revenue growth was 205 in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 revenues from the domestic business increased 21 to 2772 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 2290 million in fiscal 2005 domestic revenues excluding the dsi acquisition completed in august 2005 grew 16 

international revenues in fiscal 2007 were 1405 million an increase of 275 from 1102 million in the prior year period excluding 29 million of nonsubscription revenues 17 million from acquisitions owned less than one year and 29 million of revenues attributable to the impact of foreign currency international revenue growth was 217 year over year european revenues advanced 27 to 1143 million largely related to deployment of our portfolio analysis risk and quantitative applications a broader selection of global content and a price increase implemented during 2007 asia pacific revenues grew to 262 million up 31 from the same period a year ago revenues from international operations accounted for 30 of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2007 and 29 in fiscal 2006 international revenues in fiscal 2006 were up 32 over fiscal 2005 international revenues of 836 million on a constant currency basis and excluding the acquisition of global filings and alphametrics revenue growth from international operations advanced 22 for the year ended august 31 2006 compared to 2005 european revenues advanced 32 to 902 million from 683 million asia pacific revenues grew to 200 million up 31 from 153 million the same period a year ago 

currency impact  effective september 1 2005 our wholly owned subsidiaries within the european segment no longer operate as branch offices and operate under a functional currency different from the us dollar the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains losses that arise from translating assets and liabilities of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity prior to september 1 2005 the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiaries excluding jcf was the us dollar accordingly the foreign currency exchange gains and losses from translating net monetary assets were included in net income 

our primary foreign currency exchange exposures are related to our operating expense base in countries outside the us where approximately 30 of our employees are located this exposure is partially offset by wholly owned subsidiaries that have nondollar denominated revenues billed and expenses recorded in the euro british pound sterling and the japanese yen during fiscal 2007 our expenses incurred in nondollar denominated currencies exceeded our revenues billed in nondollar denominated currencies by approximately 248 million volatility in these and other currencies may have either positive or negative effects on our total reported revenues and expenses historically the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material we do not utilize any hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to foreign currencydenominated transactions 

a portion of our nonus clients are billed in local currencies such as the euro british pound sterling and the japanese yen in their native foreign jurisdictions in fiscal 2007 an incremental 29 million of revenues were attributable to the impact of foreign currency as compared to a favorable 12 million in fiscal 2006 

operating expenses 

 

   

cost of services 

cost of services advanced 26 to 1528 million in fiscal 2007 from 1214 million in fiscal 2006 cost of services increased 32 in fiscal 2006 from 918 million in fiscal 2005 cost of services expressed as a percentage of revenues increased 80 basis points to 321 during fiscal 2007 from 313 a year ago the increase was driven by increases in employee compensation and data costs partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets the rise in cost of services in fiscal 2006 was driven by increases in employee compensation amortization of intangible assets data costs and the first time inclusion of stockbased compensation partially offset by lower depreciation of computer related equipment as a percentage of revenues 

employee compensation and benefits for our software engineering and consulting departments increased 06 as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period a year ago employee additions as well as normal merit increases primarily accounted for the rise in employee compensation additionally the increase in data costs in 2007 compared to 2006 of 06 as a percentage of revenues was from incremental royalty payments to data suppliers and expanding our coverage of proprietary content 

a reduction in amortization of intangible assets partially offset these component increases of cost of services in fiscal 2007 amortization expense as a percentage of revenues declined 05 during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as certain intangible assets became fully amortized 

employee compensation advanced 03 as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2006 new employees including those acquired in connection with the acquisitions of dsi global filings the alphametrics business and jcf as well as normal merit increases primarily pushed up employee compensation in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a percentage of revenues data costs grew 09 during fiscal 2006 versus the prior year period largely due to incremental content costs associated with royalty payments to data content suppliers from additional client subscriptions higher levels of proprietary content collection and new costs from acquisitions included for the first time amortization of intangibles assets advanced 08 relative to revenues in fiscal 2006 due to our acquisitions of global filings the alphametrics business dsi truecourse jcf and callstreet in the past two years stockbased compensation expense recognized for the first time during fiscal 2006 amounted to an increase in cost of services of 27 million or 22 as a percentage of revenues 

a reduction in depreciation on computer related equipment as a percentage of revenues partially offset component increases of cost of services during fiscal 2006 compared to the year ago period depreciation on computerrelated equipment as a percentage of revenues declined 30 basis points in fiscal 2006 due to efforts by our engineers to optimize software to improve computational capacity and lower industry pricing partially offset by higher levels of client usage we also benefited from lower prices from our computer hardware suppliers as that industry’s trends toward faster and less expensive computers continued to move in our favor 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses advanced 16 to 1679 million in fiscal 2007 from 1447 million in fiscal 2006 sga rose 29 in 2006 from 1118 million during fiscal 2005 however sga expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues declined to 353 in fiscal 2007 compared to 374 a year ago the decreases of 210 basis points in sga as a percentage of revenues were driven by lower occupancy expense compensation costs and miscellaneous expenses measured as a percentage of revenues the rise in sga in fiscal 2006 was driven by the first time inclusion of stockbased compensation higher occupancy costs in london and tokyo and increases in employee compensation miscellaneous expenses and amortization of leasehold improvements partially offset by lower professional fees 

occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 09 during fiscal 2007 as compared to the same period a year ago in the prior year there was redundant office space during the time our european headquarters was under construction our new european headquarters located in london opened on june 19 2006 and is fully operational excluding the 27 million charge for redundant office space in fiscal 2006 occupancy costs were consistent with the year ago period as a percentage of revenues employee compensation and benefits as a percentage of revenues decreased 04 in fiscal 2007 compared to the year ago period was driven by keeping our sga headcount growth consistent with last year while growing our revenue base miscellaneous expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by 05 during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to consolidating corporate expenditures through a purchasing card and prior year payments related to acquisition activity 

employee compensation and benefits grew 12 faster than revenues during fiscal 2006 the increase is primarily attributed to a higher percentage of sga employees over the past twelve months additional employee headcount as the result of acquisitions and merit increases in compensation stockbased compensation expense recognized for the first time during fiscal 2006 amounted to an incremental cost to sga of 57 million during 2006 occupancy costs advanced 03 as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2006 as compared to the same period a year ago we consolidated our four londonbased offices into one new location which resulted in 27 million of incremental expenses from a redundancy of leased office space during fiscal 2006 

  

partially offsetting these component increases of sga as a percentage of revenues was a reduction in professional fees of 04 as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2006 of due to decreases in legal fees tax planning and other consulting fees 

employee count at august 31 2007 was 1653 up 23 from a year ago our total sales force grew approximately at the rate of revenues 

income from operations and operating margin 

operating income advanced 28 to 1551 million in fiscal 2007 from 1213 million in 2006 in fiscal 2006 operating income was up 11 from 1090 million in fiscal 2005 our operating margins in fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 were 326 313 and 349 respectively operating margin expansion in 2007 resulted from lower occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues a reduction in amortization of intangible assets and lower miscellaneous fees partially offset by increases in employee compensation and data costs the operating margin decrease in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to 84 million of stockbased compensation expense recognized for the first time during fiscal 2006 and 27 million of incremental expenses incurred in the london office move 

other income income taxes net income and earnings per share 

 

 other income 

other income grew 64 to 78 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to the same period a year ago the growth in other income was driven by higher cash and investment balances rising interest rates and shifting available cash from shortterm municipal securities to shortterm money market instruments partially offsetting the increase was the sale of companyowned real estate which resulted in a pretax gain of 13 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

during fiscal 2006 other income increased 36 million as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to higher cash balances the rise in interest rates and the completion of the sale of our only piece of companyowned real estate 

income taxes 

for fiscal 2007 the provision for income taxes increased 236 to 533 million versus the prior year period our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was 327 compared to 342 for the prior year the effective tax rate of 327 for fiscal 2007 is comprised of 346 from recurring operations and 19 of income tax benefits our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 declined 150 basis points as compared to fiscal 2006 due to 14 million of income tax benefits from the repatriation of foreign earnings to the us 11 million of benefits from recognizing a tax deduction under section 199 a benefit of 10 million from the reenactment of the us federal rd tax credit and a 04 million tax credit in france partially offset by the inclusion of income tax benefits in fiscal 2006 from the conclusion of an audit of our us federal income tax returns and final settlement of previously filed tax returns 

section 199 was designed to encourage us companies to manufacture products domestically including software applications the tax relief and health care act of 2006 which was enacted in december 2006 includes the extension of the us federal rd tax credit from january 2006 through december 2007 the fiscal 2007 repatriation of foreign earnings to the us resulted in the recognition of a foreign tax credit 

for fiscal 2006 the provision for income taxes increased 12 to 431 million up from 384 million in the comparable prior year period our effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2006 year was 342 versus 349 for the prior year our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 of 342 included 29 million in income tax benefits primarily from the conclusion of an audit of our us federal income tax returns and final settlement of previously filed tax returns based on the results of the irs examination of our tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years we decreased previously recorded tax reserves and tax expense by 14 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by our inability to recognize a full year of us research and development tax credits due to the expiration of the credit effective on december 31 2005 

  

excluding the respective tax benefits in all three fiscal years presented the effective tax rates were 346 in fiscal 2007 365 in fiscal 2006 and 366 in fiscal 2005 

net income and earnings per share 

net income rose 32 to 1096 million and diluted earnings per common share increased 30 to 214 in fiscal 2007 compared to the year ago period fiscal 2006 net income rose 16 to 829 million and diluted earnings per share advanced 15 to 164 compared to fiscal 2005 

use of nongaap financial measures 

financial measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” including revenues operating expenses and our effective tax rates have been adjusted to report nongaap financial measures that exclude revenues attributable to the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions owned less than one year nonsubscription revenues charges related to stockbased compensation and incremental expenses incurred from consolidating office locations in london net income and diluted earnings per share have also been adjusted to reflect income tax benefits we use these nongaap financial measures both in presenting our results to shareholders and the investment community and in our internal evaluation and management of the businesses we believe that these financial measures and the information we provide are useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tool that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals investors may benefit from referring to these nongaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting and analyzing future periods and may also facilitate comparisons to our historical performance 

liquidity 

the table below for the periods indicated provides selected cash flow information in thousands 

 

  

   cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 1688 million or 32 of our total assets at august 31 2007 compared with 1265 million or 28 of our total assets at august 31 2006 all our operating and capital expense requirements were financed entirely from cash generated from our operations our cash and cash equivalents increased 423 million since august 31 2006 as a result of cash provided by operations of 1559 million and cash inflows of 230 million from the exercise of employee stock options partially offsetting these cash inflows were cash outflows 803 million related to stock repurchases dividends paid of 147 million capital expenditures of 393 million and the repayment of a note in connection with the acquisition of the alphametrics business for 23 million 

  

we historically pay variable employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year in the first fiscal quarter this cash outlay is anticipated to be approximately 28 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we have included the payout in accrued compensation liabilities on our balance sheet at august 31 2007 

during the last twelve months free cash flows were 1167 million up 20 from 971 million over the year ago period drivers of free cash flow during fiscal 2007 were record levels of net income and a 98 million improvement in working capital partially offset by higher capital expenditures working capital was aided by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of payments year over year 

cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007 increased 351 million or 29 since fiscal 2006 as a result of incremental net income of 267 million a 98 million increase in working capital including 30 million in landlord contributions received in fiscal 2007 for office space construction and incremental noncash charges of 50 million from depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation partially offset by 77 million in deferred income taxes 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 91 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the significant decrease in cash outflows for acquisitions of businesses partially offset by a 156 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 we spent 283 million in cash to acquire the alphametrics and global filings businesses there were no business acquisitions completed during fiscal 2007 

net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2007 increased 702 million due to 803 million spent on the repurchase of common stock during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 13 million shares at an average cost of 6161 per share under the share repurchase program leaving 572 million authorized for future share repurchases 

capital resources 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures during fiscal 2007 totaled 393 million up 65 from 237 million in the same period a year ago of the total capital expenditures 50 related to office expansions and the remainder was for computerrelated purchases significant capital expenditures included the buildout of new space in our london chicago new york and norwalk locations and the purchase of four hewlett packard integrity mainframes to increase the processing speed of our data centers in fiscal 2008 capital expenditures net of landlord contributions are expected to range between 38 million and 44 million in fiscal 2008 this includes the enhancement of our data centers by upgrading to hewlett packard integrity mainframes 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 totaled 237 million up from 219 million in fiscal 2005 the increase was driven by higher levels of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures from the build out of the new london headquarters for our european operations incremental data center computer equipment purchases in addition to office expansions during fiscal 2006 

capital needs 

on september 1 2005 we issued an unsecured floating rate note in the amount of 17 million maturing in september 2010 the note bore interest from and including september 1 2005 at the rate of one percent below libor and was payable semiannually the note was issued in accordance with the agreement for the sale and purchase of the share capital of the alphametrics business dated as of july 27 2005 among us alphametrics and other parties the note was issued in lieu of a seller’s cash entitlement the note and related interest was paid in full on december 8 2006 

we currently have no other outstanding indebtedness other than the letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as discussed below 

in march 2007 we renewed our 364day revolving credit facility and continued to maintain our threeyear credit facility the credit facilities the “facilities” are available in an aggregate principal amount of up to 250 million for working capital and general corporate purposes with the facilities split into two equal tranches and maturing in march 2008 approximately 35 million in aggregate of these credit facilities has been utilized for letters of credit issued during the ordinary course of business as of august 31 2007 we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facilities at a weighted average annual rate of 0125 the facilities also contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk as of august 31 2007 

contractual obligations 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2007 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

 

  

 purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations 

expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations 

streamvpn limited  on september 1 2005 we acquired all the outstanding share capital of streamvpn limited now known as factset research systems limited the “alphametrics business” for aggregate consideration of 264 million including 26 million based on the level of working capital of the alphametrics business as of september 1 2005 pursuant to a definitive agreement dated july 27 2005 contingent consideration was to be payable if certain revenue targets were met during the twelvemonth period ending october 31 2006 however based on actual revenues generated by the alphametrics business during the twelvemonth period ending october 31 2006 no consideration is to be paid 

jcf group of companies— in relation to the jcf transaction up to €5000000 of contingent consideration would have been payable if certain subscription targets had been met during the period november 1 2004 through may 1 2007 the subscription targets were not attained and as such no contingent consideration was due at may 1 2007 

share repurchases 

on march 19 2007 our board of directors approved an expansion of the existing share repurchase program by an additional 100 million at that time 152 million remained authorized for repurchase under the june 20 2005 repurchase program repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed there is no timeframe to complete the repurchase program and it is expected that share repurchases will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 13 million shares at an average cost of 6161 per share under the program at august 31 2007 572 million remains authorized for future share repurchases the remaining 24490 shares repurchased during fiscal 2007 were primarily repurchases of common stock owned by employees in the employee stock ownership plan which was terminated on june 20 2005 

  

on june 20 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million of our common stock during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 320900 shares at an average cost of 4329 per share under the share repurchase program at august 31 2006 361 million remained authorized for future share repurchases in addition 64935 shares were repurchased during fiscal 2006 representing common stock owned by employees in the employee stock ownership plan 

during fiscal 2005 we repurchased 342500 shares at an average cost of 2771 per share as a result the company completed the stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on july 16 2002 under the program factset repurchased 1500000 shares at an average cost of 2003 per share the remaining repurchases during fiscal 2005 were repurchases of common stock owned by employees in the employee stock ownership plan 

on august 1 2005 the company issued 305748 common shares as part of the consideration in the acquisition of dsi on january 4 2005 the company issued 44613 common shares as part of the consideration in the acquisition of truecourse on september 1 2004 the company issued 385601 common shares as part of the consideration in the acquisition of the jcf group of companies 

dividends 

on march 20 2007 we announced that our board of directors approved increasing the regular quarterly dividend by 100 to 012 per share or 048 per share per annum beginning with our dividend payment in june 2007 on august 14 2007 a regular quarterly dividend of 012 per share was announced the cash dividend was paid on september 18 2007 to common stockholders of record on august 31 2007 cash dividends will be paid using existing and future cash generated by operations 

critical accounting estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1 the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

receivable reserves 

our client base has generally been of a high quality and as such we have not historically experienced a high level of creditrelated writeoffs aged client receivables are analyzed each month and our collection efforts are directed accordingly we take historical receivable writeoff experience trends in aged accounts receivable and general market conditions into consideration to estimate our accounts receivable reserve in accordance with this policy our receivable reserve was 14 million and 12 million as of august 31 2007 and 2006 respectively actual cancellations and billing adjustments could differ from those estimated amounts and could have an impact on the financial statements of higher or lower expense a 10 change in actual cancellations and billing adjustments during fiscal 2007 and 2006 would have affected our receivable reserves by approximately 01 million in both years 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each of fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 and determined that there had been no impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill using the methodology described herein and determined there was no impairment the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2007 was 1462 million 

we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and 

  

assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations and a writedown of the related asset 

depreciable lives of property equipment and leasehold improvements 

at august 31 2007 factset’s property equipment and leasehold improvements net was 789 million representing 15 of the company’s consolidated total assets depreciation expense for the year ended august 31 2007 was 207 million or 6 of total operating expenses management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 

property equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets’ estimated useful lives on a straightline basis for financial reporting purposes the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets technological life cycles and scheduled enhancements and upgrades a residual value is estimated at the time of asset acquisition and evaluated on a continual basis and as circumstances warrant the determination of a residual value is the anticipated fair market value of the acquired asset at the date of disposal or sale based on available market conditions and identified buyers circumstances and events relating to these assets such as system upgrades are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives residual values and impairments see “longlived assets” below are identified and prospective depreciation expense is adjusted or an impairment charge recorded accordingly 

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment leasehold improvements and identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2007 was 1157 million 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

estimated tax provision and tax contingencies 

our tax provision is an estimate based our understanding of laws in many federal state and foreign tax jurisdictions these laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business including ours the tax laws also necessitate the company to allocate it taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we record reserves for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

  

our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new offices the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would require us to use our cash which would increase our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution we would recognize a favorable tax settlement as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 fin 48 specifies how tax benefits for uncertain tax positions are to be recognized measured and derecognized in financial statements requires certain disclosures of uncertain tax positions specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the balance sheet and provides transition and interimperiod guidance among other provisions fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and as a result is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of fin 48 however based on a preliminary analysis we estimate that the cumulative effect of applying this interpretation will result in a benefit ranging between 02 million and 12 million and will be recorded as an increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 

accrued compensation 

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation approximately 20 of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary we conduct a final review of company and departmental individual performance each year end to determine the amount of discretionary bonus pools we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate accrued compensation recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition as of august 31 2007 was 288 million 

stockbased compensation 

we have a stockbased compensation plan which includes qualified and nonqualified stock options and nonvested share awards and an employee stock purchase plan see note 2 and note 11 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for a complete discussion of our stockbased compensation programs 

we determine the fair value of our nonqualified stock option awards at the date of grant using optionpricing models we valued nonqualified stock option awards granted prior to march 1 2005 using a blackscholes model we valued nonqualified stock option awards granted subsequent to march 1 2005 using a latticebinomial model we determine the fair value of our performancebased nonvested share awards at the date of grant using a lattice model and the closing market price of our stock management reviews its assumptions to determine the fair value of stockbased compensation awards 

optionpricing models require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price expected dividend yield future option forfeitures and future employee stock option exercise behaviors changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

august 2006 performancebased option grant review 

on august 14 2006 we granted 1539472 stockbased awards of which 924989 were performancebased stock options performancebased stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company performance goals the number of performancebased options that vest is based on the company achieving the least favorable performance levels of organic subscriptions or diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2008 depending on the financial performance levels attained 0 20 60 or 100 of the performancebased stock options will ultimately vest to the grantees of those stock options at august 31 2007 we have estimated that 20 or 184998 of the performancebased stock options should vest this determination requires us to recognize over the next four years an expense of 18 million in unamortized stockbased compensation as of august 31 2007 a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by the company could result in the following changes to our current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands 

 

  

   

august 2007 performancebased option grant review 

on august 14 2007 we granted 1480103 stockbased awards of which 896194 were performancebased stock options performancebased stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company performance goals the number of performancebased options that vest is based on the company achieving the least favorable performance levels of organic subscriptions or diluted earnings per share during the two fiscal years ended august 31 2009 dependent on the financial performance levels attained 0 20 60 or 100 of the performancebased stock options will ultimately vest to the grantees of those stock options at august 31 2007 we have estimated that none of the performancebased stock options should vest thus resulting in no stockbased compensation expense to recognize our estimate reflected the potential adverse impact the dislocation in the us credit markets could have on many of our clients a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by us could result in the following changes to our current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense in thousands

 market sensitivities 

we are exposed to various economic and financial risks associated with equity and foreign currency markets as well as risks related to interest rate fluctuations during the normal course of business the major equity indices for example dow jones 30 industrials russell 2000 ®  nasdaq composite ®  and msci eafe index have experienced significant volatility during the past five years more recently poor performance of major financial markets was experienced in the summer of 2007 that could have a potential adverse impact on many of our clients the demand for our solutions could be disproportionately affected by the recent downturns in the financial services industry in 2007 which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products 

continued volatility in general economic and market conditions is still possible in the near future a decline in the worldwide markets could adversely impact a significant number of our clients primarily investment management firms and investment banks and increase the likelihood of personnel and spending reductions among our existing and potential clients continued investigations into the investment management industry by various regulatory bodies could have an adverse effect on our business external factors such as the threat of terrorist activities or volatile energy prices could undermine the general economic environment a policy of persistent interest rate increases adopted by the federal reserve bank continued inflationary pressures or both could derail the current economic environment and adversely affect the operations of our clients in addition changes to regulations regarding soft dollar payments could have a negative impact on our operations 

the fair market value of our investment portfolio at august 31 2007 was 174 million or 9 of the aggregated cash cash equivalents and investment balance it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our investment policy pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment policy dictates that the weighted average duration of shortterm investments may not exceed two years our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options or futures nor are we permitted to invest on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low

a large number of factset’s content suppliers are in direct competition with each other and in some cases with factset factset continues to pursue mutually beneficial partnerships with longtime thirdparty data providers however if necessary factset is committed to acquiring or building content sets on its own since 2001 the company has acquired six content businesses lionshares mergerstat callstreet jcf truecourse and europrospectus and has fully integrated their data sets into the company’s system while at the same time continuing to invest in development of thirdparty data feeds across all content areas the net effect of this strategy to date has been to increase the accessibility of data to the financial industry and to improve the quality of the data for its clients 

during fiscal 2006 the company completed one contentrelated acquisition on february 17 2006 the company acquired all the outstanding share capital of europrospectuscom limited now known as factset global filings limited the “global filings” business for 75 million in cash global filings provides access to equity and fixed income prospectuses the service offers full text clause and field searching on debt equity and warrant prospectuses pricing supplements and ma transactions the acquisition is consistent with the company’s strategy of selectively creating and distributing its own financial information content in order to offer its clients best of breed content choices 

during fiscal 2006 factset released new private company and private equity databases that have been integrated into its primary investment banking product ib central the company has continued to enhance existing content sets notably its estimates offering which now includes key research brokers and several features including near realtime processing 

the company also completed an acquisition in fiscal 2006 that is consistent with the company’s strategy of developing tools to make client workflows more efficient on september 1 2005 the company acquired all the outstanding share capital of streamvpn limited now known as factset research systems limited the “alphametrics business” for aggregate consideration of 238 million plus an additional 26 million based on the level of working capital of the alphametrics business as of september 1 2005 the alphametrics business provides institutional clients with a suite of software tools for capturing measuring and ranking the value of ideas provided by sellside professionals as well as those ideas generated internally by research staff 

the company has established a vast private wide area network to provide clients access to the company’s data centers factset’s wide area network provides a highspeed direct link between the client’s local network and the data content and powerful applications found on the company’s mainframes 

a significant part of the company’s strategy to maintain longterm client relations involves both consulting services and client training clients are encouraged to utilize factset the company’s help desk operates virtually around the clock and sales and consulting personnel regularly visit clients to enhance support and the value of the factset products the company strongly encourages its clients to take part in the training programs conducted either at the client’s location or a factset office factset’s training programs are designed to give clients a comprehensive understanding of the service 

factset competes in the global financial information services industry which includes both large and wellcapitalized companies as well as smaller niche firms international and domestic competitors include market data suppliers news and information providers and many of the content providers that supply the company with financial information included in the factset system competitors and competitive products in the united states include online database suppliers and integrators and their applications such as the thomson corporation bond edge owned by interactive data corporation yield book owned by citigroup reuters group plc bloomberg lp standard and poor’s a division of the mcgrawhill companies including its capital iq product line wilshire associates incorporated frank russell and msci morgan stanley capital international inc many of these firms offer products or services which are similar to those sold by the company 

demand for the portfolio analytics suite of applications continues to rise this suite is comprehensive and includes the applications for portfolio attribution risk management and quantitative analysis portfolio analysis continued to be the cornerstone of the offering to investment management clients during fiscal 

2006 and represents the largest revenue contributing component of the suite at august 31 2006 there were over 475 clients representing approximately 3900 users who subscribed to this service this compares favorably to a total of 425 clients and 3300 users a year ago fiscal 2006 also included several significant product releases 

·   the first phase of fixed income attribution analysis powered by derivative solutions was integrated into the suite

·   a new portfolio publishing product that creates presentationready reports for investment teams and management boards has been introduced

·   alphatesting 30 and compustat point in time data have proven to be compelling offerings for quantitative professionals

one of the key features of the suite’s central application portfolio analysis is an attribution analysis report that enables portfolio managers to dissect and explain the performance of a portfolio through time for many years factset’s primary focus has been equity portfolios—those that are comprised of stock holdings of publicly traded companies factset’s desire to enhance the attribution module to cover virtually all asset classes including corporate and sovereign debt and sophisticated derivative securities such as mortgagebacked securities and credit default swaps was a major factor in acquiring derivative solutions in august 2005 the acquisition has enabled the company to deliver an enhanced multiasset class attribution module if executed correctly the company believes this could create new markets for its products and a potentially strong competitive advantage in the industry 

marquee ®  the company’s realtime quotes and news application continued to grow in users and clients during fiscal 2006 with successes within the company’s investment banking client base all new clients receive marquee as part of the standard workstation feature set making the basic factset service even more valuable marquee was installed on hundreds of buy and sellside research analyst desktops during fiscal 2006 the application works in concert with factset’s existing platform or can be installed as a standalone solution for professionals focused on realtime market movements client usage of marquee increased more than 60 during fiscal 2006 additionally the application has emerged as a leading driver of new client sales and has been the key component of several large wins for factset in the private wealth management and equity research areas of our business many clients recognize marquee as a product that can streamline their daily workflows while optimizing their financial information budgets unique within the industry factset’s marquee and directions now offer the ability to access realtime information wedded to indepth historical analysis tools on the same technology platform as a result many clients have decided to migrate to the consolidated factset solution a particularly compelling feature of the combined factset marquee directions desktop is its ability to share client portfolio holdings automatically between directions and marquee client portfolios may be made available for detailed study in the portfolio analytics applications as well as realtime monitoring in marquee

additional information with respect to the company’s business is included in the following pages and is incorporated herein by reference 

 

  




 item 1a   risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents factset files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in assessing these risks investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k filed with the sec including the company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 

factset’s operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the following factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on its business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect its stock price 

factset must continue to introduce new products and product enhancements to maintain its leading technological position 

the market for the company’s products is characterized by rapid technological change changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards new products based on new technologies or new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable as a result the company’s future success will continue to depend upon its ability to develop new products or product enhancements that address the future needs of its target markets and to respond to their changing standards and practices factset may not be successful in developing introducing marketing and licensing the company’s new products or product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis or at all and the company’s new products and product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance in addition clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or product enhancements in addition the company’s ability to develop new products and product enhancements is dependent upon the products of other software vendors including certain system software vendors database vendors and development tool vendors if the products of such vendors have design defects or flaws are unexpectedly delayed in their introduction or are unavailable on acceptable terms the company’s business could be seriously harmed 

factset must ensure the protection and privacy of client data 

many of factset’s products and services are comprised of information delivered through a variety of media including the internet softwarebased applications and dedicated transmission lines factset relies on a complex network of internal controls to protect the privacy of client data if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in its implementation misappropriation of client data could incur which could damage the company’s reputation and ultimately its business 

a prolonged outage at one of factset’s data centers could result in reduced service and the loss of customers 

factset’s customers rely on the company for the delivery of timesensitive uptodate data factset’s business is dependent on its ability to rapidly and efficiently process substantial volumes of data and transactions on its computerbased networks and systems the company’s computer operations and those 

of its suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure terrorist attacks acts of war internet failures computer viruses and other events beyond the company’s reasonable control factset maintains backup facilities for each of its major data centers to seek to minimize the risk that any such event will disrupt operations in addition factset maintains insurance for such events however the business interruption insurance factset carries may not be sufficient to compensate the company fully for losses or damages that may occur as a result of such events in addition a loss of the company’s services may induce its customers to seek alternative data suppliers any such losses or damages incurred by factset could have a material adverse effect on its business although the company seeks to minimize these risks through security measures controls and backup data centers there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or effective 

factset must hire and retain key qualified personnel 

factset’s business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees competition for technical personnel in the industry in which the company competes is intense the company is limited in its ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected factset needs technical resources such as product development engineers to develop new products and enhance existing products the company relies upon sales personnel to sell its products and services and maintain healthy business relationships 

factset’s ability to integrate newly acquired companies 

factset has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions from time to time acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into its operations and there can be no assurances that factset will manage acquisitions successfully the related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business 

under generally accepted accounting principles factset reviews its amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in its industry factset may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on its results of operations 

the negotiation of contract terms supporting new and existing databases or products 

as a leading provider of global financial and economic information factset relies on its ability to combine more than 200 databases into its own dedicated online service factset’s business employs a wide variety of data from a substantial number of data suppliers around the world certain of the company’s products rely on single or limited number of suppliers although factset makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises the failure of its suppliers to deliver accurate data and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company’s business 

uncertain economic and financial market conditions may affect factset’s revenues 

factset conducts significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 factset derived 28 and 27 of its revenue respectively from outside the united states accordingly future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates reductions in expenditures by large customers poor performance of major financial markets political or social unrest terrorist attacks economic instability or natural disasters in a specific country or region environmental and trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect the company’s ability to import its products to export its products from or sell its products in various countries political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns health or similar issues such as the outbreak of avian influenza bird flu difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries the target clients for its products include a range of financial services organizations that manage investment portfolios including asset managers investment advisors brokerage firms banks plan sponsors hedge funds and others the success of many of its clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets factset believes that demand for its solutions could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations disruptions instability or downturns in the economy and the financial services industry which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay cancel or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company’s costs expenses and financial condition 

increased competition in factset’s industry that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 

factset continues to experience intense competition across all markets for its products its competitors range in size from fortune 100 companies to small singleproduct businesses that are highly specialized while the company believes the breadth of its businesses and product portfolio offers benefits to its customers that are a competitive advantage its competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical marketing and financial resources to compete with us in addition barriers to entry to create a single purpose product are generally low the internet as a distribution channel and noncommercial software model described above has reduced barriers to entry even further these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes price reductions and increased operating costs such as for marketing and sales incentives resulting in lower revenue gross margins and operating income weak economic conditions also can result in customers’ seeking to utilize lowercost information that is available from alternative sources 

factset’s ability to achieve its historical levels of profitability and growth rates for revenues earnings per share and cash flows 

factset has established revenues earnings per share and cash flow growth targets for 2007 its growth is dependent upon successfully executing its strategy the company’s initiatives and investments may not be sufficient to achieve and maintain such growth targets a failure to reach and maintain its desired revenue growth or its earnings per share growth targets could have a material adverse affect on the market value of its common stock 

third parties may claim factset infringes upon their intellectual property rights 

from time to time factset receives notices from others claiming that the company has infringed upon their intellectual property rights the number of these claims may grow responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with the company’s customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements if factset is required to enter into such agreements or take such actions its operating margins may decline as a result factset has made and expects to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights as part of its strategy to manage this risk 

factset defends its intellectual property rights and combats unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques preventing unauthorized use or infringement of its rights is difficult while these activities adversely affect us revenue the impact on revenue from outside the united states is more significant particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 

resolution of ongoing and other probable audits by tax authorities 

factset is subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of its business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the company’s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof which could adversely impact the company’s result of operations and financial condition in future periods factset is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities although factset believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on its provision for income taxes and cash tax liability based on the results of an audit or litigation a material effect on its income tax provision net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 

factset’s future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by lower than anticipated earnings in countries where the company has lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where factset has higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof 

changes in accounting may affect factset’s reported earnings and operating income 

generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of its business are highly complex and involve subjective judgments changes in these rules their interpretation or changes in the company’s products or business could significantly change its reported earnings and operating income and could add 

significant volatility to those measures without a comparable underlying change in cash flows from operations 

in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements factset uses certain estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and management’s knowledge of current events and actions that factset may undertake in the future its most critical accounting estimates are described in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on pages 28 to 31 of the company’s 2006 annual report to shareholders in addition factset makes certain estimates under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 accounting for contingencies  including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves while management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion and therefore actual results may differ 

internal controls may be ineffective 

effective internal controls are necessary to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud pursuant to the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” factset is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting including management’s assessment of the effectiveness of such control internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud therefore even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in addition projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate if factset fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if factset experiences difficulties in its implementation its business and operating results could be harmed factset could fail to meet its reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on its stock price 

potential changes in securities laws and regulations governing the investment industry’s use of soft dollars may reduce factset’s revenues 

approximately 35 of factset’s revenues are paid through soft dollar arrangements on july 18 2006 the sec issued interpretive release no 3454165 which became effective on july 24 2006 the release provides guidance on asset managers’ use of client commissions to pay for brokerage and research services within the scope of section 28e of the securities exchange act of 1934 the interpretive release outlines a framework for determining whether what types of research services are fall within the safe harbor provisions of that section market participants have a sixmonth grace period ending on january 24 2007 to bring their soft dollar practices into compliance with the new guidance although the company believes that its services fall within the description of eligible research services covered by the safe harbor that its services provide lawful and appropriate assistance to the money manager in undertaking investment decisions and that the commissions for the services are reasonable in relation to the value of the services provided nevertheless a client might arrive at a different conclusion moreover if additional rules are issued or certain interpretations are followed that narrow the definition of research or brokerage services which results in its clients being unable to use soft dollar arrangements to pay for factset products and services the company’s revenues could decrease

revenues 

 

  

revenues —revenues in fiscal 2006 increased 24 to 3874 million from 3126 million in fiscal 2005 the 24 increase in fiscal 2006 compared to the same period a year ago breaks down into 17 growth in the underlying organic business and 7 growth from acquisitions owned less than one year acquisitions over the last twelve months including global filings the alphametrics business and dsi accounted for 7 or 206 million of the revenue growth in the fiscal 2006 performance was driven by many product lines in all geographic regions the pace of signing on new clients kept the revenue growth rate of our us business over 21 and our international business at 32 in fiscal 2006 our ib team was the catalyst behind adding over 3000 users during fiscal 2006 and increased the appeal of our ib central application applications such as marquee our suite of portfolio analysis services deeper penetration within sell side firms and expanded content choices deepened users’ engagement with our products and caused clients users and subscriptions to increase subscriptions to databases and applications to existing clients comprised approximately half of our revenue growth new clients and users accounted for the remainder we have deployed our capital to develop a diverse product suite that attracts and engages a global institutional client base fiscal 2005 revenues increased 24 to 3126 million from 2519 million in 2004 the 24 increase in fiscal 2005 compared to same period a year ago breaks down into 15 growth in the underlying organic business and 9 growth from acquisitions owned less than one year acquisitions during fiscal 2005 including jcf dsi and truecourse accounted for 9 or 239 million of the revenue growth in the fiscal 2005 the 15 organic revenue growth in fiscal 2005 was attributable to new client additions further penetration into overseas markets subscriptions to additional applications and databases by existing clients demand for the portfolio analytics suite of applications continues to rise our ability to service professionals with a global reach was also driven by new business higher demand for global content among clients reflects a market shift in asset allocation to nonus investments during the period

demand for our portfolio analytics applications rose during fiscal 2006 this suite is comprehensive and includes the applications for portfolio attribution risk and quantitative analysis the portfolio analysis workstation is the largest revenue contributing member of this product suite approximately 475 clients consisting of 3900 users subscribed to the pa 20 application as of august 31 2006 an increase of about 50 clients and 600 users over the prior year 

subscriptions —“subscriptions” at a given point in time represent the forwardlooking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to our clients with proper notice to us our clients are generally able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time at august 31 2006 subscriptions were 4226 million up 748 million or 22 from the prior year total of 3478 million on a constant currency basis and excluding the acquisition of global filings and the alphametrics business subscriptions increased 655 million or 19 since august 31 2005 subscriptions from overseas operations increased from 921 million at august 31 2005 to 1256 million at august 31 2006 representing 30 of the companywide total subscription growth was strong representing the power of our products and client service model the average subscription per client was 237000 at the end of 2006 compared to 220000 and 258000 at the close of fiscal years 2005 and 2004 respectively subscription growth in fiscal years 2006 and 2005 was due to the addition of net new clients incremental subscriptions to our services by existing clients and increased users subscriptions at the end of fiscal 2005 were 3478 million up 275 from the prior year total of 2729 million the acquisitions jcf and dsi added 350 million of incremental subscriptions during fiscal 2005 on a constant currency basis and excluding the acquisition of jcf and dsi subscriptions increased 399 million or 15 since august 31 2004

clients and users — at august 31 2006 client count was 1785 an increase of 209 clients or 13 over the prior 12 months included in this rise was the net addition of 25 clients from the acquisitions of alphametrics and global filings in fiscal 2005 clients rose by 115 on a net basis including clients added by acquisitions client count increased by 517 on a net basis in fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2005 the dsi and jcf acquisitions added 73 and 329 net new clients respectively the ability to consolidate multiple services into one through the factset platform has been a compelling opportunity for firms to recognize efficiencies

there were approximately 29800 users as of august 31 2006 up 11 from 26800 at the end of fiscal 2005 this count excludes professionals who subscribe exclusively to the alphametrics webbased product while there are many users the price per user is materially lower than that of our directions platform 

in 2005 factset users increased to about 26800 up 5700 from the prior year fiscal 2005 user growth was the result of a further increase in users at our investment banking clients as well as additional passwords from the dsi and jcf acquisitions at the purchase date the dsi and jcf acquisitions added about 400 and 2000 users respectively 

our client retention rate remained at a rate in excess of 95 during each of the past three fiscal years no individual client accounted for more than 3 of total subscriptions as of august 31 2006 subscriptions from the ten largest clients did not surpass 15 of total client subscriptions 

revenues by geographic region — revenues from the domestic business increased 21 to 2772 million in fiscal 2006 compared to 2290 million in the same period a year ago domestic revenues excluding the dsi acquisition grew 16 revenues from domestic operations increased 14 in fiscal 2005 as compared to 2009 million in fiscal 2004

international revenues in fiscal 2006 were 1102 million an increase of 32 from 836 million in the prior year period on a constant currency basis and excluding the acquisition of global filings and alphametrics revenue growth from international operations advanced 22 for the year ended august 31 2006 compared to a year ago european revenues advanced 32 to 902 million from 683 million asia pacific revenues grew to 200 million up 31 from 153 million the same period a year ago revenues from international operations accounted for 28 and 27 of our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively international revenues in fiscal 2005 were up 64 from fiscal 2004 international revenues of 510 million 

currency impact — effective september 1 2005 our wholly owned subsidiaries within the european segment no longer operate as branch offices and operate under a functional currency different from that of the rest of the company the financial statements of these foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using periodend rates of exchange for assets and liabilities and average rates for the period for revenues and expenses translation gains losses that arise from translating assets and liabilities of foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a component of stockholders’ equity

prior to september 1 2005 the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiaries excluding jcf was the us dollar accordingly the foreign currency exchange gains and losses from translating net monetary assets were included in net income 

our primary foreign currency exchange exposures are related to those wholly owned subsidiaries that have nondollar denominated revenues billed and expenses recorded in the eurodollar british pound sterling and the japanese yen during fiscal 2006 our expenses incurred in nondollar denominated currencies exceeded our revenues billed in nondollar denominated currencies by approximately 133 million historically the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations has not been material we do not utilize any hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to foreign currencydenominated transactions 

a portion of our nonus clients are billed in local currencies such as the eurodollar british pound sterling and the japanese yen in their native foreign jurisdictions volatility in these and other currencies may have either positive or negative effects on our total reported revenues the effect of currency movements on our fiscal 2006 revenue was immaterial 

operating expenses 

 

  

cost of services 

cost of services advanced 32 to 1214 million in fiscal 2006 from 918 million in fiscal 2005 cost of services increased 24 in fiscal 2005 to 918 million from 742 million in fiscal 2004 the rise in cost of services in fiscal 2006 was driven by increases in employee compensation amortization of intangible assets data costs and the first time inclusion of stockbased compensation partially offset by lower depreciation of computer related equipment as a percentage of revenues the main drivers of the 2005 growth were the first time inclusion of expenses from the jcf acquisition increases in employee compensation data costs and amortization of intangible assets partially offset by lower clientrelated communication costs and depreciation on computer related equipment 

employee compensation and benefits for our software engineering and consulting departments advanced 130 million in 2006 and 76 million in 2005 employee additions including those acquired in connection with the acquisitions of dsi global filings the alphametrics business and jcf as well as normal merit increases primarily pushed up employee compensation in both years data costs grew 83 million and 90 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively versus the prior year periods the increased data expenses were largely due to incremental content costs associated with royalty payments to data content suppliers from additional client subscriptions higher levels of proprietary content collection and new costs from acquisitions included for the first time amortization of intangibles assets advanced 40 million in fiscal 2006 and 31 million in 2005 due to our acquisitions of global filings the alphametrics business dsi truecourse jcf and callstreet in the past two years stockbased compensation expense recognized for the first time during fiscal 2006 amounted to an increase in cost of services of 27 million 

a reduction in depreciation on computer related equipment as a percentage of revenues partially offset these component increases of cost of services depreciation on computerrelated equipment as a percentage of revenues declined 30 basis points in fiscal 2006 and 130 basis points in fiscal 2005 due to efforts by our engineers to optimize software to improve computational capacity and lower industry pricing partially offset by higher levels of client usage we also benefited from lower prices from our computer hardware suppliers as that industry’s trends toward faster and less expensive computers continued to move in our favor a similar trend in the telecommunications industry during 2005 allowed us to control communications costs as well clientrelated communication costs as a percentage of revenues decreased 84 basis points in 2005 due to lower industry pricing partially offset by higher bandwidth requirements 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses advanced 29 to 1447 million in fiscal 2006 from 1118 million in fiscal 2005 sga rose 24 in 2005 from 901 million during fiscal 2004 the rise in sga in fiscal 2006 was driven by the first time inclusion of stockbased compensation higher occupancy costs in london and tokyo and increases in employee compensation travel costs miscellaneous expenses and amortization of leasehold improvements partially offset by lower professional fees sga grew in fiscal 2005 due to higher employee compensation increased travel expenses greater rent and amortization of leasehold improvements and additional professional fees partially offset by lower miscellaneous fees 

employee compensation and benefits expanded 159 million during fiscal 2006 and 155 million in 2005 the increase can be primarily attributed to more employees classified as sga over the past twelve months additional employee headcount as the result of acquisitions and merit increases in compensation stockbased compensation expense recognized for the first time during fiscal 2006 amounted to an incremental cost to sga of 57 million during 2006 occupancy costs advanced 45 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to the same period a year ago we consolidated our four londonbased offices into one new location which resulted in 27 million of incremental expenses from a redundancy of leased office space during fiscal 2006 our new european headquarters located in london opened on june 19 2006 and is fully operational in fiscal 2005 rent expense and amortization of leasehold improvements increased 35 million primarily due to the opening of our norwalk headquarters in august 2004 increases in the number of professionals traveling to service our expanded client base produced incremental travel expenses of 20 million and 29 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively 

partially offsetting these component increases of sga was a reduction in professional fees in 2006 of 03 million compared to the same period a year ago professional fees increased 19 million in fiscal 2005 compared to 2004 due to increases in legal fees tax planning and other consulting fees miscellaneous expenses decreased 34 million in fiscal 2005 due to the reduction of certain nonincome tax accruals after formal discussions with local tax authorities and favorable currency movements 

employee count at august 31 2006 was 1368 up 17 from a year ago the percentage increase in employee headcount breaks down into 15 from organic growth and 2 from acquisitions over the last twelve months our total sales force grew approximately at the rate of revenues 

income from operations and operating margin 

operating income advanced 11 to 1213 million in fiscal 2006 while increasing 24 to 1090 million in 2005 from 876 million in 2004 our operating margins in fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 were 313 349 and 348 respectively the operating margin decrease in 2006 as compared to 2005 is primarily due to 84 million of stockbased compensation expense recognized for the first time during fiscal 2006 and 27 million of incremental expenses incurred in the london office move operating margin expansion in 2005 resulted from lower depreciation on computerrelated equipment reduced communication costs and decreased miscellaneous fees partially offset by increases in employee compensation data costs and amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenues 

other income income taxes net income and earnings per share 

 

  

other income 

during fiscal 2006 other income increased 36 million as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to higher cash balances the rise in interest rates and the completion of the sale of our only piece of companyowned real estate the sale of our companyowned real estate resulted in a pretax gain of 13 million or 002 per share during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the gain was included in other income and had no impact on operating income for the year interest income improved during fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year due to higher cash and investment balances rising interest rates and shifting available cash from managed accounts to short term money market instruments other income decreased 06 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to lower average cash and investment balances during fiscal 2005 

income taxes 

for fiscal 2006 the provision for income taxes increased 12 to 431 million up from 384 million in the comparable prior year period our effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2006 year was 342 versus 349 for the prior year our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 of 342 included 29 million in income tax benefits primarily from the conclusion of an audit of the company’s us federal income tax returns and final settlement of previously filed tax returns based on the results of the irs examination of the company’s tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years the company decreased previously recorded tax reserves by 14 million and decreased income tax expense by a corresponding amount during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 the decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by our inability to recognize a full year of us research and development tax credits due to the expiration of the credit effective on december 31 2005 an income tax benefit of 19 million was recognized in the year ago period due to the closure of previously filed tax returns the fiscal 2004 effective tax rate was 351 which included the effect of a 15 million income tax benefit from the final settlement of prior year tax returns and additional 

federal and state tax planning excluding the respective tax benefits in all three fiscal years presented the effective tax rates were 365 in fiscal 2006 366 in fiscal 2005 and 368 in fiscal 2004 

during fiscal 2006 we filed an application for change in accounting method with the irs as a result of irs revenue procedure 200434 allowing advanced cash collections to be recognized as income in the same period such revenue is recorded for gaap purposes this resulted in a 34 million reduction to current deferred tax assets and taxes payable 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 and the working families tax relief act of 2004 were both enacted in october 2004 these laws contain provisions which could potentially impact our effective tax rate these items include the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion and the enactment of a domestic manufacturing deduction based on our evaluation performed in fiscal 2006 the impact of these laws on our effective tax rate for the year ended august 31 2006 was immaterial 

net income and earnings per share 

net income rose 16 to 829 million and diluted earnings per common share increased 15 to 164 in fiscal 2006 compared to the year ago period fiscal 2005 net income rose 24 to 718 million and diluted earnings per share advanced 24 to 143 compared to fiscal 2004 

liquidity 

the table below for the periods indicated provides selected cash flow information in thousands 

 

  

1   we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities which includes the cash cost for taxes and changes in working capital less capital expenditures free cash flow is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flows provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we use this financial measure both in presenting our results to shareholders and the investment community and in our internal evaluation and management of the businesses management believes that this financial measure and the information we provide are useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tool that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals and is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives

cash and cash equivalents aggregated to 1265 million or 28 of our total assets at august 31 2006 compared with 595 million or 17 of our total assets at august 31 2005 our cash and cash equivalents increased 671 million since august 31 2005 as a result of cash provided by operations of 1208 million proceeds of 29 million generated from the sale of companyowned real estate and cash inflows of 166 million from the exercise of employee stock options partially offsetting these cash inflows were cash outflows of 283 million for the acquisitions of global filings and the alphametrics business on 

february 17 2006 and september 1 2005 respectively 163 million related to stock repurchases dividends paid of 100 million and capital expenditures of 237 million 

we historically pay variable employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year in the first quarter this cash outlay is anticipated to be approximately 20 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we have included the payout in accrued compensation and represented it as a liability on our balance sheet at august 31 2006 

all our operating and capital expense requirements were financed entirely from cash generated from our operations 

cash generated by operating activities during fiscal 2006 increased 265 million or 28 since fiscal 2005 as a result of incremental net income of 112 million incremental noncash charges of 118 million from depreciation amortization stockbased compensation and deferred taxes a gain of 13 million generated from the sale of companyowned real estate a 13 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and increases in taxes payable by 70 million partially offset by a 70 million decrease in income tax benefits from stock option exercises as a result of the presentation reclassification from operations to financing upon the adoption of sfas 123r in 2005 cash flows from operating activities increased 119 million or 144 as a result of a larger amount of net income a reduction in our days’ sales outstanding and higher income tax benefits from stock option exercises partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and current taxes payable 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 620 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to the significant decrease in cash outflows for acquisitions of businesses in fiscal 2005 we spent 922 million in cash and cash equivalents to purchase the jcf dsi and truecourse businesses in fiscal 2006 we spent 283 million in cash to acquire the alphametrics and global filings businesses net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 320900 shares at an average cost of 4329 per share under the share repurchase program leaving 361 million authorized for future share repurchases 

capital resources 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 totaled 237 million up from 219 million in the same period a year ago the increase was driven by higher levels of leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures from the build out of the new london headquarters for our european operations incremental data center computer equipment purchases in addition to office expansions during fiscal 2006 capital expenditures are expected to total approximately 29 million to 35 million for fiscal 2007 approximately 55 of these capital expenditures should relate to computerrelated equipment and the remainder for the expansion of various office locations 

capital expenditures totaled 219 million in fiscal 2005 which included 92 million in computerrelated equipment and 127 million in furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements significant capital additions in fiscal 2005 included three new mainframes and the completion of our new headquarters facility in norwalk 

capital needs 

on september 1 2005 the company issued an unsecured floating rate note in the amount of 17 million maturing in september 2010 the note bears interest from and including september 1 2005 at the rate of one percent below libor and payable semiannually the note was issued in accordance with the agreement for the sale and purchase of the share capital of the alphametrics business dated as of july 27 2005 among the company alphametrics and other parties the note was issued in lieu of a seller’s cash consideration the noteholder has the option to require the company to repay all or any part of the note as of march 1 2006 or any subsequent interest payment date 

we currently have no other outstanding indebtedness other than the letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as discussed below 

in march 2006 we renewed our 364day revolving credit facility and continued to maintain our threeyear credit facility the credit facilities the “facilities” are available in an aggregate principal amount of up to 250 million for working capital and general corporate purposes with the facilities split into two equal tranches and maturing in march 2007 and march 2008 approximately 30 million in aggregate of these credit facilities has been utilized for letters of credit issued during the ordinary course of business as of august 31 2006 we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facilities at a weighted average annual rate of 0125 the facilities also contain covenants that among other things require the company to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios 

contractual obligations 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2006 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

 

  

1   note payable represents our contractual obligation created from the acquisition of the alphametrics business on september 1 2005 the note was issued in lieu of a seller’s cash entitlement and allows the noteholder the option to require us to repay all or any part of the note as of march 1 2006 or any subsequent interest payment date

  

2   capital purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for construction or acquisitions of fixed assets these obligations are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property

3   purchase obligations represents payment due in future periods in respect of commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services as well as commitments to our various data vendors

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations and intention to conclude purchases in the future for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations 

any contractual obligations contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are excluded from the table above specifically related to the alphametrics acquisition contingent consideration will be payable if certain revenue targets are met during the twelvemonth period ending october 31 2006 in relation to the jcf transaction up to € 5000000 of contingent consideration will be payable if certain subscription targets are met during the period september 1 2004 through may 31 2007 as of august 31 2006 no targets have been attained or projected to be achieved and as such no amount of contingent consideration has been accrued for at august 31 2006

expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations contingent contractual obligation amounts are dependent on the achievement of targets and may vary significantly 

share repurchases 

on june 20 2005 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million of our common stock repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market and privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions no minimum number of shares to be repurchased has been fixed during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 320900 shares at an average cost of 4329 per share under the program at august 31 2006 361 million remains authorized for future share repurchases in addition 64935 shares were repurchased during fiscal 2006 representing common stock owned by employees in the employee stock ownership plan which was terminated on june 20 2005 

during fiscal 2005 factset repurchased 342500 shares at an average cost of 2771 per share as a result the company completed the stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors on july 16 2002 under the program factset repurchased 1500000 shares at an average cost of 2003 per share the remaining repurchases during fiscal 2005 were repurchases of common stock owned by employees in the employee stock ownership plan

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk as of august 31 2006 

critical accounting estimates 

we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1 the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and 2 changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 

receivable reserves 

our client base has generally been of a high quality and as such we have not historically experienced a high level of creditrelated writeoffs aged client receivables are analyzed each month and our collection efforts are directed accordingly we take historical company information industry trends and general market conditions into account in estimating reserves and apply a percentage to the monthend client receivable balance additionally we also include amounts relating to the estimated cancellations and billing adjustments in our receivable reserves in accordance with this policy our receivable reserve was 12 million and 11 million as of august 31 2006 and 2005 respectively actual cancellations and billing adjustments could differ from those estimated amounts and could have an impact on the financial statements of higher or lower expense a 10 change in actual cancellations and billing adjustments during fiscal 2006 and 2005 would have affected our receivable reserves by approximately 01 million in both years 

valuation of goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable we complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses and consider other publicly available market information we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each of fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 and determined that there had been no impairment in the fourth quarter of 

fiscal 2006 we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill using the methodology described herein and determined there was no impairment the carrying value of goodwill as of august 31 2006 was 1414 million 

we determine fair value using the discounted cash flows model this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors including market conditions legal and technological factors and the profitability of future business strategies it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions as well as future expectations 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for goodwill impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations and a writedown of the related asset 

longlived assets 

longlived assets comprised of property equipment leasehold improvements and identifiable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review include significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated fair value which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset using the impairment evaluation methodology described herein there have been no longlived asset impairment charges for each of the last three years the carrying value of longlived assets as of august 31 2006 was 1029 million 

our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

we have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material 

tax contingencies 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we record reserves for probable exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new offices the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed in this report are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

accrued compensation 

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we make significant estimates in determining our accrued compensation a significant percentage of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary a final review of departmental individual performance is conducted each year end to determine the ultimate amount of discretionary bonus pools we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against management’s expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate accrued compensation recorded in the consolidated statement of financial condition as of august 31 2006 was 193 million 

stockbased compensation 

we have a stockbased compensation plan which includes qualified and nonqualified stock options and nonvested share awards and an employee stock purchase plan see note 2 and note 13 to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for a complete discussion of our stockbased compensation programs 

we determine the fair value of our nonqualified stock option awards at the date of grant using optionpricing models nonqualified stock option awards granted prior to march 1 2005 were valued using a blackscholes model nonqualified stock option awards granted subsequent to march 1 2005 were valued using a latticebinomial model we determine the fair value of our performancebased non 

vested share awards at the date of grant using a lattice model and the closing market price of our stock management reviews its assumptions and the valuations provided by independent thirdparty valuation advisors to determine the fair value of stockbased compensation awards 

optionpricing models require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price expected dividend yield future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

on august 14 2006 we granted 1539472 stockbased awards of which 924989 were performancebased stock options the aggregate fair value of the performancebased stock options at the date of grant was 130 million and will be expensed over their vesting period of five years performancebased stock options require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company performance goals the number of performancebased options that ultimately vest is based on achieving certain financial performance levels during fiscal years 2007 and 2008 dependent on the financial performance levels attained 0 20 60 or 100 of the performancebased stock options will ultimately vest to the grantees of those stock options at august 31 2006 we have estimated that 20 or 184998 of the performancebased stock options should vest this results in stockbased compensation expense of 26 million to be recognized by us over the next five years a change in the actual financial performance levels achieved by the company could result in a change in our current estimate of the vesting percentage and related expense any change in our estimates would not have been material to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending august 31 2006 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2005 fasb issued fasb staff position “fsp” sfas no 123r1 classification and measurement of freestanding financial instruments originally issued in exchange for employee services under fasb statement no 123r  to defer the requirement of sfas 123r that a freestanding financial instrument originally subject to sfas 123r becomes subject to the recognition and measurement requirements of other applicable gaap when the rights conveyed by the instrument to the holder are no longer dependent on the holder being an employee of the entity the rights under stockbased payment awards issued to employees by us are all dependent on the recipient being an employee therefore this fsp currently does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and its measurement of stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas 123r 

in october 2005 the fasb issued fsp sfas no 123r2 practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 123r  to provide guidance on determining the grant date for an award as defined in sfas 123r this fsp stipulates that assuming all other criteria in the grant date definition are met a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of an award to an individual employee is presumed to exist upon the award’s approval in accordance with the relevant corporate governance requirements provided that the key terms and conditions of an award a cannot be negotiated by the recipient with the employer because the award is a unilateral grant and b are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval we have applied the principles set forth in this fsp upon its adoption of sfas 123r 

in november 2005 the fasb issued fsp sfas no 123r3 transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of sharebased payment awards  to provide an alternate transition method for the implementation of sfas 123r because some entities do not have and may not be able to re 

create information about the net excess tax benefits that would have qualified as such had those entities adopted sfas 123r for recognition purposes this fsp provides an elective alternative transition method that method comprises a a computational component that establishes a beginning balance of the apic pool related to employee compensation and b a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas 123r we have applied the alternative transition method set forth in this fsp upon its adoption of sfas 123r 

in february 2006 the fasb issued fsp sfas no 123r4 classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event  to address the classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event the guidance in this fsp amends paragraphs 32 and a229 of sfas 123r the company’s employee stock option plans have no cash settlement provisions therefore this fsp currently does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements or its measurement of stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas 123r 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” this interpretation clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes “sfas 109” specifically fin 48 clarifies the application of sfas 109 by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements additionally fin 48 provides guidance on measurement derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods of income taxes as well as the required disclosure and transition this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the requirements of fin 48 and have not yet determined if the adoption of fin 48 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 fair value measurements “sfas 157” among other requirements sfas 157 defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and also expands disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities sfas 157 is effective beginning the first fiscal year that begins after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas 157 on our financial position and results of operations 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements “sab 108” which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement the guidance is applicable for fiscal years ending after november 15 2006 we do not believe sab 108 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

first quarter fiscal 2007 expectations 

·   revenues are expected to range between 106 million and 109 million

full year fiscal 2007 

·   capital expenditures should total approximately 29 million to 35 million the midpoint of the range is 76 of subscriptions at august 31 2006 and is consistent with our average over the past five years capital expenditures will be allocated approximately 55 to computer equipment and the remainder to office expansion

market sensitivities 

we are exposed to various economic and financial risks associated with equity and foreign currency markets as well as risks related to interest rate fluctuations during the normal course of business the major equity indices for example dow jones 30 industrials russell 2000 ®  nasdaq composite ®  and msci eafe index have experienced significant volatility during the past five years continued volatility in general economic and market conditions is still possible in the near future external factors such as the threat of terrorist activities or volatile energy prices could undermine the general economic environment a decline in the worldwide markets could adversely impact a significant number of our clients primarily investment management firms and investment banks and increase the likelihood of personnel and spending reductions among our existing and potential clients continued investigations into the investment management industry by various regulatory bodies could have an adverse effect on our business a policy of persistent interest rate increases adopted by the federal reserve bank continued inflationary pressures or both could derail the current economic environment and adversely affect the operations of our clients in addition changes to regulations regarding soft dollar payments could have a negative impact on our operations

the fair market value of our investment portfolio at august 31 2006 was 166 million it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our investment portfolio pursuant to our established investment guidelines we try to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment policy dictates that the weighted average duration of shortterm investments may not exceed two years our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options or futures nor are we permitted to invest on margin because we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low

revenues from international operations amounted to 836 million in 2005 up 641 from the prior year revenues generated by our european and asia pacific sales operations grew 741 and 305 respectively fiscal 2005 european revenue included the operations of the jcf group of companies which was acquired on september 1 2004 excluding jcf international revenue growth in fiscal 2005 was 222 international revenues increased 154 to 510 million in fiscal 2004 as european revenues advanced 151 and asia pacific revenues rose 164 in fiscal 2005 international revenues totaled 268 of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004 overseas revenues accounted for 202 of total revenues revenue growth in all periods related to investments in our nonus product suite and the number of employees servicing clients abroad content additions for nonus clients includes fundamentals from both reuters and compustat estimates from jcf and reuters and expanded economic data from ecowin at august 31 2005 28 of our employees were based overseas ninety percent of our total revenues are remitted to us in us dollars net monetary assets maintained by our international branch offices were not material and foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material effect on the results of our operations 

subscriptions 

subscriptions at a given point in time represent the forwardlooking revenues for the next twelve months from all subscription services currently being supplied to our clients our clients are generally able to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time at august 31 2005 subscriptions were 3478 million up 275 from the prior year subscriptions at the end of fiscal 2004 were 2729 million up 161 from the prior year total of 2350 million the average annual subscription per client was 220000 at the end of 2005 compared to 258000 and 242000 at the close of fiscal years 2004 and 2003 respectively the decline in average annual subscriptions in fiscal 2005 was caused by the inclusion in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 of jcfs clients whose average subscription level per client was significantly lower than our historical client base 

subscription growth in fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was due to the addition of net new clients incremental subscriptions to our services by existing clients and increased users in aggregate factset added 290 million of subscriptions on the purchase dates of jcf and dsi demand for portfolio analytics continues to increase this suite is comprehensive and includes the applications for portfolio attribution risk and quantitative analysis the portfolio analysis workstation is the largest revenue contributing member of this product suite at august 31 425 clients representing nearly 3300 users subscribed to portfolio analysis workstations up from approximately 385 clients and 2900 users at the conclusion of fiscal 2004 

approximately three quarters of our subscriptions are derived from our investment management clients and the remaining subscriptions are attributable to our investment banking clients no individual client accounted for more than 5 of total subscriptions and subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not exceed 25 of total client subscriptions 

clients 

in fiscal 2005 clients rose by 115 on a net basis including clients added by acquisitions client count increased by 517 on a net basis during fiscal 2005 the dsi and jcf acquisitions added 73 and 329 net new clients respectively clients totaled 1059 at the end of fiscal 2004 due to the net addition of 89 clients during the twelve month period our client retention rate has exceeded 95 during each of the past three fiscal years 

users 

in 2005 factset users increased to 26800 up 5700 from the prior year fiscal 2005 user growth was the result of a further increase in users at our investment banking clients as well as additional passwords from the dsi and jcf acquisitions at the purchase date the dsi and jcf acquisitions added 400 and 2000 users respectively during fiscal 2004 user count rose 1900 to 21100 from 19200 at august 31 2003 in 2004 and 2005 our clients specifically those in the investment banking industry increased hiring due to an improved market environment 

operating expenses and net income 



cost of services 

cost of services advanced 237 to 918 million in fiscal 2005 cost of services increased 119 in fiscal 2004 to 742 million from 663 million in fiscal 2003 the growth in fiscal 2005 was caused primarily by the inclusion of expenses from jcfs acquisition for the first time as well as increases in employee compensation data costs and amortization of intangible assets partially offset by lower clientrelated communication costs and depreciation on computer related equipment the main drivers of the 2004 growth were higher costs related to employee compensation data costs and clientrelated communication expenses partially offset by a decrease in depreciation on computerrelated equipment 

employee compensation associated with the software engineering and consulting departments grew 76 million in 2005 and 64 million in 2004 the increases in both years were caused by employee additions and normal merit increases within these two groups data costs rose 90 million in fiscal 2005 and 32 million in fiscal 2004 growth in fiscal 2005 and 2004 was due to new costs from acquisitions included for the first time and increased content costs associated with additional database subscriptions by clients amortization of intangible assets advanced 31 million in fiscal 2005 due to the acquisitions of dsi truecourse jcf and callstreet depreciation on computerrelated equipment decreased 16 million and 25 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively our investment in this area decreased as we focused on software optimizations to improve our computational capacity instead of purchasing new hardware we also benefited from lower prices on the part of our computer hardware suppliers as industry trends toward faster and less expensive computers continued to move in our favor a similar trend in the telecommunications industry allowed us to control communications costs as well this decrease is notable given the rise in our telecommunications bandwidth requirements due to the increase in the number of clients that subscribe to marquee our realtime news and quotes application marquee usage increased more than 100 during fiscal 2005 clientrelated communication costs decreased 08 million in fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2004 clientrelated communication costs increased 08 million due to executing the rollout of marquee 

selling general and administrative sga 

sga rose 241 to 1118 million in fiscal 2005 and 137 to 901 million during fiscal 2004 in addition to the inclusion of sga expenses associated with the acquisition of jcf sga grew in fiscal 2005 due to higher employee compensation increased travel expenses greater rent and amortization of leasehold improvements and additional professional fees partially offset by lower miscellaneous fees growth in fiscal 2004 was the result of increases in employee compensation travel expenses rent and amortization of leasehold improvements and professional fees 

employee compensation rose 155 million in 2005 and 51 million in 2004 additions to employee headcount including acquisitions and merit increases in compensation were largely responsible for the increases in both years increases in the number of professionals traveling to service our expanded client base produced the 29 million and 13 million increases in travel related expenses in fiscal 2005 and 2004 in fiscal 2005 rent expense and amortization of leasehold improvements rose 35 primarily due to the opening of our norwalk headquarters in august 2004 rent expense and amortization of leasehold improvements increased 15 million in fiscal 2004 resulting from the virginia data center opening our office expansion in new york and the 837000 charge incurred in fiscal 2004 related to the corporate headquarters move to norwalk professional fees grew 19 million in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 due to increases in legal fees tax planning and other consulting fees miscellaneous fees decreased 34 million in fiscal 2005 due to the reduction of certain nonincome tax accruals after formal discussions with local tax authorities and favorable currency movements

operating income advanced 244 to 1090 million in fiscal 2005 while increasing 142 to 876 million in 2004 from 767 million in 2003 

our operating margins in fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 were 349 348 and 345 respectively the operating margin increase in 2005 is attributable to lower depreciation on computerrelated equipment reduced communication costs and decreased miscellaneous fees partially offset by increases in employee compensation data costs and amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenues operating margin expansion in 2004 was largely the result of decreases in depreciation on computerrelated equipment amortization of leasehold improvements and computer repair and maintenance as a percentage of revenues these decreases were partially offset by increases in data costs and professional fees as a percentage of revenues as well as the nonrecurring relocation charge of 837000 incurred in 2004 related to our new headquarters 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 349 which included an income tax benefit of 19 million the fiscal 2004 effective tax rate was 351 which included the effect of a 15 million income tax benefit in fiscal 2003 the effective tax rate was 349 which included the impact of a 13 million benefit the income tax benefits in each year resulted from the final settlement of prior year tax returns and additional federal and state tax planning excluding the respective tax benefits in all three fiscal years presented the effective tax rates were 366 in fiscal 2005 368 in fiscal 2004 and 365 in fiscal 2003 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 and the working families tax relief act of 2004 were both enacted in october 2004 these laws contain provisions which could potentially impact our effective tax rate these items include the extension of the research and development credit through december 2005 the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion and the enactment of a domestic manufacturing deduction we are continuing to evaluate the effect on our effective tax rate for the year ended august 31 2006

contractual obligations 

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as necessary capital expenditures to support growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2005 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



1 capital purchase obligations represent contractual obligations for construction or acquisitions of fixed assets these obligations are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial condition as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 2 purchase obligations represents payments due in future periods in respect of commitments to purchase goods and services such as telecommunication and computer maintenance services as well as commitments to our various data vendors 3 business purchase obligations represent our contractual obligation to consummate the acquisition of stream vpn in september 2005 this amount represents the cash to be paid by us to effectuate the acquisition this amount excludes professional fees and other expenses incurred to complete the acquisition purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations to purchase rather than amounts for which we are contractually obligated to make corresponding disbursements for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations 

any contractual obligations contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are excluded from the table above specifically related to the jcf transaction up to €5000000 of contingent consideration will be payable if certain subscription targets are met during approximately two years following the closing of the transaction as of august 31 2006 an additional required payment of up to €5000000 will be made provided that all targets are achieved in relation to the stream vpn acquisition which was completed on september 1 2005 contingent consideration will be payable by november 1 2006 if certain revenue targets are met 

expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations contingent contractual obligation amounts are dependent on the achievement of targets and may vary significantly 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk as of august 31 2005 

new accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued its final standard on accounting for sharebased payments sbp fasb statement no 123r revised 2004 fas 123r sharebased payment  that requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards the standard is effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 and applies to all outstanding and unvested sbp awards at a companys adoption date we have adopted fas 123r for all fiscal periods beginning after september 1 2005 we expect the adoption of fas 123r to increase operating expenses between 25 and 30 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 sab 107 sharebased payment  which provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between fas 123r and certain sec rules and regulations as well as provides the sec staffs views regarding the valuation of sharebased payment arrangements in conjunction with our implementation of fas 123r we have adopted sab 107 for all fiscal periods beginning after september 1 2005 

critical accounting policies 

in december of 2001 the sec issued fr 60 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and in january of 2002 the sec issued fr 61 commission statement about managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are making certain incremental disclosures in our critical accounting policies below pursuant to these changes we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities other than operating leases nor do we make use of derivatives transactions or engage in significant relatedparty transactions other than the stock purchases from our founders noted above lease commitments and credit lines are disclosed in the quarterly reports on form 10q and annual report on form 10k for each fiscal year moreover we have determined that the following represent our critical accounting policies 

revenue recognition 

we apply sab 104 to our business arrangements for revenue recognition the majority of clients are invoiced monthly in arrears to reflect the actual services rendered to them clients of jcf and dsi are invoiced in advance on an annual and quarterly basis respectively 

subscription revenue is earned each month as the service is rendered to clients according to the specific subscription and the number of users deployed for such month a provision is estimated for billing adjustments and uncollectible accounts such provisions are accounted for as a reduction of subscription revenue with a corresponding reduction to subscriptions receivable 

we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 

• the client subscribes to our research services • our service has been rendered and earned during the month • the amount of the subscription is fixed and determinable based on established rates for each product offering quoted on an annualized basis and • collectibility is reasonably assured amounts that have been earned but not yet paid through the receipt of commissions on securities transactions or through cash payments are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as receivables from clients and clearing brokers net amounts that have been received through commissions on securities transactions or through cash payments that are in excess of earned subscription revenues are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as deferred fees 

under the guidance in sab 104 our subscriptions represent a single earnings process collection of subscription revenues through factset data systems incs fds external clearing broker does not represent a separate service or earnings process since fds is not the principal party to the settlement of the securities transactions for which the clearing broker charges clearing fees 

receivable reserves 

our client base has generally been of a high quality and as such we have not historically experienced high creditrelated writeoffs aged client receivables are analyzed each month and our collection efforts are directed accordingly we take historical company information industry trends and general market conditions into account in estimating reserves and apply a percentage to the monthend client receivable balance additionally we also include amounts relating to the estimated cancellations and billing adjustments we discussed above in our receivable reserves actual cancellations and billing adjustments could differ from those estimated amounts and could have an impact on the financial statements of higher or lower expense 

valuation of goodwill 

in september 2001 we adopted sfas 142 which requires that a goodwill impairment test be completed during the first six months of the year the standard is adopted sfas 142 further requires a separate annual goodwill impairment test to be performed each year along with additional goodwill impairment tests on an eventdriven basis we performed our goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended february 28 2002 and noted that goodwill had not been impaired we performed an annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each of fiscal years 2005 2004 and 2003 and determined that there had been no impairment on an ongoing basis we will evaluate the acquired businesses and related assets for indications of potential impairment we may base our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators on market conditions legal and technological factors and the operational performance of the company future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in the statement of income and a writedown of the related asset 

longlived assets 

we depreciate computers and related equipment on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives of three years or less furniture and fixtures are depreciated over estimated useful lives of five to seven years using a double declining balance method we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the shorter of the related lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the improvements the potential impairment of our fixed assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that the carrying value of the fixed assets may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review of fixed assets include but are not limited to the following 

• significant changes in technology that make current computerrelated assets that we use in our operations obsolete or less useful and • significant changes in the way we use these assets in our operations in connection with the acquisitions of innovative systems techniques inc insyte lionshares mergerstat callstreet jcf truecourse and dsi we estimated and recorded the fair value of intangible assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition we review intangibles for evidence of impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that the carrying value of the intangible assets may not be recoverable 

intangible assets consist of acquired technology trademarks noncomplete agreements and certain acquired content databases and are amortized on a straightline or accelerated basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and twenty years 

accounting for income taxes 

we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are determined by calculating the future tax consequences associated with differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as a result of this process we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition a valuation allowance is established to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized to the extent a valuation allowance is established or adjusted in a period we include this amount in the consolidated statement of income as an expense or benefit within the provision for income taxes 

accrued liabilities 

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we make significant estimates in determining our accrued liabilities accrued liabilities include estimates relating to employee compensation operating expenses and tax liabilities most of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary a final review of departmental individual performance is conducted each year end to determine the ultimate amount of discretionary bonus pools we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against managers expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate because final reviews are not normally completed until after the yearend closing cycle it is possible that actual amounts ultimately approved could differ from amounts previously accrued based upon information available prior to the final reviews as such the difference if any will be recorded in the period in which the estimate is changed and would result in higher or lower compensation expense 

forwardlooking factors 

dividend payment 

on august 16 2005 we announced a regular quarterly dividend of 005 per share the cash dividend was paid on september 21 2005 to common stockholders of record on august 31 2005 

fiscal 2006 guidance 

as previously discussed factset recently closed the acquisition of both derivative solutions and stream vpn these acquisitions added 164 million of new subscriptions factsets combined subscriptions were 3529 million at september 1 2005 

we believe these acquisitions will be breakeven in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and modestly accretive to eps for the entire fiscal year 

revenue range for the 1st quarter of fy 2006 is 88 to 90 million excluding acquisitions we expect organic revenue growth between 14 and 15 

as scheduled factset adopted fas 123r to expense stock based compensation effective september 1 2005 incremental noncash expense on a pretax basis should total 25 to 30 million in the 1st quarter the midpoint of this range would have reduced eps in the just completed 4th quarter by 04 per share or 11 the adoption of fas 123r will have no impact on the companys free cash flow generation 

operating margins for the 1st quarter should range from 295 to 315 excluding the impact of fas 123r operating margins would be 325 to 345

income taxes 

in the normal course of business our tax filings are subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities audits by two tax authorities are presently ongoing although there is inherent uncertainty in the audit process we have no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes or penalties or both that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position beyond current estimates 

market sensitivities 

we are exposed to various economic and financial risks associated with equity and foreign currency markets as well as risks related to interest rate fluctuations during the normal course of business the major equity indices for example dow jones 30 industrials russell 2000® nasdaq composite® and msci eafe index have experienced significant volatility in the past five years continued volatility in general economic and market conditions is still possible in the near future external factors such as the threat of terrorist activities acts of nature such as hurricanes and earthquakes or rising energy prices could undermine any potential economic recovery or advancement a decline in the worldwide markets could adversely impact a significant number of our clients primarily investment management firms and investment banks and increase the likelihood of personnel and spending reductions among our existing and potential clients continued investigations into the investment management industry by various regulatory bodies could have an adverse effect on our business a policy of persistent interest rate increases adopted by the federal reserve bank andor continued inflationary pressures could derail the current economic recovery and adversely affect the operations of our clients in addition changes to regulations regarding soft dollar payments could have a negative impact on our operations 

the fair market value of our investment portfolio at august 31 2005 was 166 million it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our investment portfolio pursuant to our established investment guidelines thirdparty managers construct portfolios to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment policy dictates that the weightedaverage duration of shortterm investments may not exceed two years our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options or futures nor are we permitted to invest on margin because we have no outstanding longterm indebtedness and we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low

factset research systems inc the “company” or “factset” supplies financial intelligence to the global investment community the company combines more than 200 databases including content regarding tens of thousands of companies from multiple stock markets research firms governments and other sources into a single online platform of information and analytics clients have simultaneous access to content from all the sources which they can combine and download into spreadsheets and analyze using factset or custombuilt applications 

the company aggregates thirdparty content from over 50 database suppliers factset seeks to maintain contractual relationships with a minimum of two content providers for each type of financial data when possible thirdparty content contracts are generally renewable annually and may often be terminated on one year’s notice a large number of the company’s content suppliers are in direct competition with each other and in some cases with factset thirdparty content fees are either billed directly to factset or its clients content fees billed to the company are on a fixed or royalty per client cost basis 

in may 2004 factset acquired callstreet llc “callstreet” callstreet is a provider of corporate conference call transcripts and event calendars to the investment community a highly desirable content set for the company’s clients the product has been completely integrated into factset’s online system 

on september 1 2004 factset closed its acquisition of the jcf group of companies “jcf” jcf headquartered in paris france provides a global database of broker detail and consensus earnings estimates and other financial projections to the professional investment community in europe jcf’s reputation for quality has been the major reason for that group’s emergence in recent years as a prominent player in the broker estimate space jcf provides access to its proprietary content set via jcf quant a microsoft ® windowsbased application as well as via electronic data feeds the jcf database has been integrated into factset directions the company’s online application and has been made available to factset’s clients on a subscription basis with the acquisition factset has provided its clients with an additional option in this important content area and will continue to invest in the company’s collection efforts to provide a premium earnings estimate database in the industry

factset has historically focused on integrating thirdparty content into our system as the financial information industry has consolidated over the past several years it has become increasingly evident that strategically factset must be in a position to control access to critical content to its clients toward that end factset has evolved a multidimensional strategy to provide what it believes is the widest breadth and the best quality content to its clients factset continues to pursue mutually beneficial partnerships with longtime thirdparty data providers however if necessary factset is committed to acquiring or building content sets on its own since 2001 the company has acquired four content providers – lionshares mergerstat callstreet and jcf – and has fully integrated their data sets into its system while at the same time continuing to invest in development of thirdparty data feeds across all content areas the net effect of this strategy to date has been to increase the accessibility of these data sets to the financial industry and to improve the quality of the data for its clients

revenues from international operations totaled 510 million in 2004 up 154 from the prior year revenues generated by our european and asia pacific sales operations increased 151 and 164 respectively international revenues rose 122 to 442 million in fiscal 2003 as european revenues grew 141 and asia pacific revenues advanced 62 in fiscal 2004 international revenues comprised 202 of consolidated revenues overseas revenues accounted for 199 of total revenues in fiscal 2003 greater than 95 of our total revenues are remitted to us in us dollars net monetary assets maintained by our international branch offices were not material and foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material effect on the results of our operations 

  

s ubscriptions   “subscriptions” at a given point in time represent the forwardlooking revenues for the next twelve months from all services currently being supplied to our clients typically our clients enjoy the freedom and flexibility to add to delete portions of or terminate service at any time subscriptions at the end of fiscal 2004 were 2729 million up 161 from the prior year total of 2350 million subscriptions grew 111 in 2003 from 2115 million at the conclusion of fiscal 2002 the average annual subscription per client was 258000 at the end of 2004 compared to 242000 and 232000 at the close of fiscal years 2003 and 2002 respectively 

the primary drivers of subscription growth in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were the addition of net new clients incremental subscriptions to our services by existing clients and the expiration of price discounts previously granted to clients at the end of fiscal 2004 we had 385 clients representing nearly 2900 users who subscribed to portfolio analytics up from approximately 345 clients and 2500 users at the conclusion of fiscal 2003 fiscal 2004 subscriptions grew nearly 20 million due to the acquisition of callstreet llc “callstreet” on may 7 2004 the acquisition of the entire ownership interest in factset mergerstat llc “mergerstat” on january 23 2003 increased fiscal 2003 subscriptions by approximately 20 million approximately three quarters of our subscriptions were derived from our investment management clients and the remaining subscriptions from our investment banking clients no individual client accounted for more than 5 of total subscriptions and subscriptions from our ten largest clients did not exceed 25 of total client subscriptions

c ost of s ervices  cost of services increased 119 in fiscal 2004 to 742 million cost of services grew 98 to 663 million in fiscal 2003 from 604 million in fiscal 2002 the main components of the increase in 2004 were higher costs related to employee compensation and benefits data costs and clientrelated communication expenses partially offset by a decrease in depreciation on computerrelated equipment incremental growth in cost of services in 2003 resulted from greater levels of employee compensation and benefits data costs and clientrelated communication costs 

employee compensation and benefits associated with the software engineering and consulting departments grew 64 million in 2004 and 33 million in 2003 the increases in both years were caused by employee additions and growth in merit increases within these two groups data costs rose 32 million in fiscal 2004 and 14 million in fiscal 2003 the rise in 2004 resulted from expanded database selections offered to our clients higher database fees due to a greater number of client users and our acquisition of callstreet during the third quarter in 2003 our data costs expanded because of higher database costs due to a greater number of client users and augmented database offerings made available to our clients clientrelated communication costs increased 08 million in both 2004 and 2003 incremental costs incurred to execute the rollout of marquee our application featuring a streaming display of news quotes and broker research to our clients was the main factor in the increase for both years depreciation on computerrelated equipment decreased 25 million in 2004 and remained nearly flat in 2003 relative to 2002 during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we implemented an upgrade of our mainframe computers located in both of our data centers the acquisition cost of our new hewlettpackard marvel mainframe computers was significantly less than the acquisition cost of the replaced mainframes which were originally placed in service in fiscal 2001 the lower depreciable cost bases of these mainframes were largely responsible for the decrease in computerrelated depreciation costs in fiscal 2004 

  

s elling  g eneral and a dministrative sga  sga grew 137 to 901 million during fiscal 2004 and 56 to 793 million in fiscal 2003 increased levels of employee compensation and benefits travel expenses rent and amortization of leasehold improvements and professional fees were the primary reasons for the growth in 2004 the increase in 2003 was mainly due to higher costs associated with employee compensation and benefits partially offset by lower professional fees and other expenses 

employee compensation and benefits rose 51 million in 2004 and 52 million in 2003 additions to employee headcount and merit increases in compensation were largely responsible for the increases in both years increased travel by our sales personnel to service our expanding client base produced the 13 million increase in travel expenses in fiscal 2004 while travel costs remained relatively flat during 2003 rent expense and amortization of leasehold improvements increased 15 million in fiscal 2004 our data center opening in virginia and an office expansion in new york were the main factors contributing to this growth during 2003 we extended the lease terms for our greenwich facility and one of our stamford office facilities for an additional year at a higher rental rate in order to synchronize the expiration of the leases related to our three connecticut offices with the move to our new norwalk headquarters facility as part of our relocation and consolidation of our connecticut offices we incurred a charge of 837000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 each of our leases related to our three former connecticut offices expired on september 30 2004 as a result of our abandonment of these facilities in august 2004 we incurred an accelerated rent expense of 305000 in fiscal 2004 which would have been recorded in fiscal 2005 had we occupied those facilities until their respective leases expired we incurred an additional 362000 in accelerated depreciation in 2004 related to furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements utilized at our three former office facilities as these assets did not become part of our consolidated norwalk office facility in addition we incurred a moving charge of 120000 to consummate the move to our single office in norwalk these three charges totaling 787000 were part of the 837000 charge incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 rent expense and amortization of leasehold improvements remained flat in 2003 compared to 2002 professional fees and other expenses grew 19 million in fiscal 2004 due to higher legal tax planning and other consulting fees professional fees and other expenses declined 16 million in 2003 as a result of lower consulting fees incurred and decreased expenses for taxes other than income taxes

our operating margins in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were 348 and 345 respectively operating margin in 2002 was 312 operating margin expanded in 2004 largely as a result of decreases in depreciation on computerrelated equipment amortization of leasehold improvements and computer repair and maintenance as a percentage of revenues these decreases were partially offset by increases in data costs and professional fees as a percentage of revenues as well as the nonrecurring relocation charge of 837000 incurred in 2004 related to our new norwalk connecticut headquarters the improvement in the 2003 operating margin was attributed to declines in depreciation on computer 

  

   

related equipment professional fees and other expenses and rent expense and amortization of leasehold improvements as a percentage of revenues we further incurred 904000 in expense related to the relocation of one our data centers from new york city to manchester new hampshire during fiscal 2002 which reduced that year’s operating margin 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 351 which included the effect of a 15 million income tax benefit related to the settlement of prior year tax returns for certain state credits additional state and federal tax planning and certain changes in estimates including the impact of a 13 million income tax benefit associated with additional federal income tax planning and certain changes in estimates related to income taxes payable for fiscal years prior to 2003 our fiscal 2003 effective tax rate was 349 the effective tax rate was 364 in fiscal 2002 after factoring in an income tax benefit of 893000 largely resulting from adjustments to prior years’ federal and state tax returns attributable to a favorable state income tax ruling excluding the respective tax benefits in all three fiscal years presented the effective tax rates were 368 in fiscal 2004 365 in fiscal 2003 and 378 in fiscal 2002 

the american jobs creation act of 2004 and the working families tax relief act of 2004 were both enacted in october 2004 these bills contain provisions which could potentially impact our effective tax rate these items include the extension of the research and development credit through december 2005 the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion and the enactment of a domestic manufacturing deduction we are continuing to evaluate the effect on the company’s effective tax rate for the quarter ended november 30 2004 and the year ended august 31 2005

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our operating activities generated yearly cash flow of 764 million 747 million and 667 million in fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in 2004 cash flows from operating activities increased 17 million as a result of a larger amount of net income as adjusted for noncash related items and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses and taxes payable partially offset by growth in accounts receivable and other working capital assets as a result our days’ sales outstanding rose from 61 days at the end of fiscal 2003 to 63 days at the close of fiscal 2004 the improvement in operating cash flow in fiscal 2003 was due to growth in net income as adjusted for noncash related items increases in accounts payable accrued compensation and taxes payable partially offset by increased accounts receivable and declining deferred fees 

fiscal 2004 capital expenditures totaled 378 million of those expenditures 269 million related to leasehold improvements and the acquisition of furniture and fixtures for the expansion of our domestic office facilities primarily relating to our new headquarters facility in norwalk connecticut the remaining 109 million was expended in 2004 largely related to the acquisition of computerrelated assets mainly for our two data centers we executed our mainframe computer upgrade by placing into service five hewlettpackard marvel mainframe computers during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 for a total of eight installed at our two data centers 

in january 2004 we purchased 2000000 shares of our common stock from one of our cofounders howard e wille at a price per share of 3458 we purchased an additional 1000000 shares of our common stock in march 2004 from another cofounder charles j snyder at a price per share of 3812 the total cash expended for the two common stock purchases from our cofounders was 1073 million 

cash cash equivalents and investments totaled 981 million and comprised 427 of total assets at august 31 2004 all our operating and capital expenditure needs were financed completely by cash flows generated by our operations we currently have no outstanding indebtedness other than letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business as discussed below 

in fiscal 2004 we renewed our 364day revolving credit facility and continued to maintain our existing threeyear credit facility both credit facilities the “facilities” are available in an aggregate principal amount of up to 250 million for working capital and general corporate purposes with the facilities split into two equal tranches and maturing march 2005 and november 2004 approximately 35 million in aggregate of these credit facilities has been utilized for letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business we have no present plans to draw any portion of the remaining available credit of approximately 215 million we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the facilities at a weighted average annual rate of 0175 the facilities also contain covenants that among other things require us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated net worth and certain leverage and fixed charge ratios 

  

   

b usiness c ombinations  on may 7 2004 we acquired all the ownership interests of callstreet for 65 million in cash callstreet is a provider of corporate conference call transcripts and event calendars to the investment community a highly desirable content set for our clients this acquisition is consistent with our strategy of controlling access to critical content used by our clients this factor contributed to a purchase price in excess of fair value of the callstreet net tangible and intangible assets and as a result we have recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction the weighted average life of the intangible assets is two years goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes a summary of the callstreet purchase price allocation consists of the following 

  

   

the operating results of callstreet are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition pro forma statements of income have not been presented because the effect of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial results 

  

share repurchases 

  

on july 16 2002 the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to acquire shares of our outstanding common stock in open market or negotiated transactions this program authorized the repurchase of up to 1000000 shares of our common stock the program established no set minimum number of shares for repurchase during fiscal 2004 we repurchased 65000 shares at an average cost of 3759 per share under this program since the inception of the stock repurchase program we have repurchased approximately 772000 shares at an average cost of 2664 per share under this program 

in january 2004 we purchased 2000000 shares of our common stock from one of our two cofounders howard e wille at a price per share of 3458 in march 2004 we purchased an additional 1000000 shares of our common stock from our other cofounder charles j snyder at a price per share of 3812 the board of directors approved both purchases of common stock from our cofounders prior to the execution of those purchases the total cash expended for the two common stock purchases from our cofounders was 1073 million 

  

s ubsequent e vent  on september 1 2004 we acquired all the outstanding shares of the jcf group “jcf” of companies jcf based in paris and london was a provider of global broker estimates and other financial and macroeconomic data to institutional investors jcf provides access to its proprietary content set via jcf quant a microsoft ® windowsbased application as well as via electronic data feeds the acquisition enables us to provide our clients with an additional option in this important estimates content area the preliminary purchase price of the jcf acquisition is 652 million which was paid in cash and the issuance of 257067 common shares in addition up to €5000000 of contingent consideration will be payable if certain subscription targets are met during the two years following the closing of the transaction 

  

contractual obligations 

  

fluctuations in our operating results the degree of success of our accounts receivable collection efforts the timing of tax and other payments as well as continued growth of our operations will impact our liquidity and cash flows in future periods the effect of our contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be considered in conjunction with the factors mentioned here 

  

   

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of august 31 2004 and the corresponding effect that these obligations will have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods amounts in this table exclude amounts already recorded on our consolidated statement of financial condition at august 31 2004 

  

   

     

purchase orders do not necessarily reflect a binding commitment but are merely indicative of authorizations to purchase rather than amounts for which we are contractually obligated to make corresponding disbursements for the purpose of this tabular disclosure purchase obligations for goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction it is expected that all the contractual obligations noted in the table will be funded from existing cash and cash flows from operations 

any contractual obligations contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are excluded from the table above specifically related to the jcf transaction up to €5000000 of contingent consideration will be payable if certain subscription targets are met during the two years following the closing of the transaction as of august 31 2006 additional required payments of €5000000 will be made provided that all targets are achieved or exceeded 

expected timing pertaining to the contractual obligations included in the table above has been estimated based on information currently available the amounts paid and timing of those payments may differ based on when the goods and services provided by our vendors to whom we are contractually obligated are actually received as well as due to changes to agreed upon amounts for any of our obligations contingent contractual obligation amounts are dependent on the targets being achieved and can vary significantly 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk as of august 31 2004 

  

n ew a ccounting p ronouncements  in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 104 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements  the adoption of sab 104 did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position sab 104 primarily rescinds the accounting guidance contained in sab 101 related to multipleelement revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf 0021 while the wording of sab 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf 0021 the revenue recognition principles of sab 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab 104 which was effective upon issuance 

  

   

critical accounting policies 

  

in december of 2001 the sec issued fr 60 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and in january of 2002 the sec issued fr 61 commission statement about management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are making certain incremental disclosures in our critical accounting policies below pursuant to these changes we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities other than operating leases nor do we make use of derivatives transactions or engage in significant relatedparty transactions other than the stock purchases from our founders noted above lease commitments and credit lines are disclosed in the quarterly reports on form 10q and annual report on form 10k for each fiscal year moreover we have determined that the following represent our critical accounting policies 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we apply sab 104 to our business arrangements for revenue recognition our company does not license sell lease or market computer software clients are invoiced monthly in arrears to reflect the actual services rendered to them subscription revenue is earned each month as the service is rendered to clients according to the specific subscription and the number of workstations deployed for such month a provision is made to allow for billing adjustments as a result of cancellation of service or reduction in the number of workstations such provisions are accounted for as a reduction of subscription revenue with a corresponding reduction to subscriptions receivable 

we recognize revenue when all the following criteria are met 

    amounts that have been earned but not yet paid through the receipt of commissions on securities transactions or through cash payments are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as receivables from clients and clearing brokers net amounts that have been received through commissions on securities transactions or through cash payments that are in excess of earned subscription revenues are reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition as deferred fees 

under the guidance in sab 104 our subscriptions represent a single earnings process collection of subscription revenues through factset data systems inc’s “fds” external clearing brokers does not represent a separate service or earnings process since fds is not the principal party to the settlement of the securities transactions for which the clearing brokers charge clearing fees 

  

receivable reserves 

  

our client base has generally been of a high quality and as such we have not historically experienced high creditrelated writeoffs aged client receivables are analyzed each month and our collection efforts are directed accordingly we take historical company information industry trends and general market conditions into account in estimating reserves and apply a percentage to the monthend client receivable balance additionally we also include amounts relating to the estimated cancellations and billing adjustments we discussed above in our receivable reserves actual cancellations and billing adjustments could differ from those estimated amounts and could have an impact on the financial statements of higher or lower expense 

  

valuation of goodwill 

  

in september 2001 we adopted sfas 142 which requires that a goodwill impairment test be completed during the first six months of the year the standard is adopted sfas 142 further requires a separate annual goodwill impairment test to be performed each year along with additional goodwill impairment tests on an eventdriven basis we performed our goodwill impairment test during the quarter ended february 28 2002 and noted that goodwill had not been impaired we performed an annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 and determined that there had been no impairment on an ongoing basis we will evaluate the acquired businesses and 

  

   

related assets for indications of potential impairment we may base our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators on market conditions legal and technological factors and the operational performance of the company future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment do exist and that goodwill associated with our previous acquisitions is impaired which could result in an impairment loss in the statement of income and a writedown of the related asset 

  

longlived assets 

  

we depreciate computers and related equipment on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives of three years or less furniture and fixtures are depreciated over estimated useful lives of five to seven years using a double declining balance method we amortize leasehold improvements on a straightline basis over the shorter of the related lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the improvements the potential impairment of our fixed assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that the carrying value of the fixed assets may not be recoverable factors that may cause an impairment review of fixed assets include but are not limited to the following 

  after we acquired innovative systems techniques inc “insyte” lionshares mergerstat and callstreet we recorded assets for intangible assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition we review intangibles for evidence of impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events indicate that the carrying value of the intangible assets may not be recoverable 

intangible assets consist of acquired technology and certain acquired content databases resulting from the acquisitions of the insyte lionshares mergerstat and callstreet businesses and are amortized on a straightline basis using estimated useful lives ranging between two and ten years 

  

accounting for income taxes 

  

we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are determined by calculating the future tax consequences associated with differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as a result of this process we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition a valuation allowance is established to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will not be realized to the extent a valuation allowance is established or adjusted in a period we include this amount in the consolidated statement of income as an expense or benefit within the provision for income taxes 

  

accrued liabilities 

  

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles we make significant estimates in determining our accrued liabilities accrued liabilities include estimates relating to employee compensation operating expenses and tax liabilities most of our employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary a final review of departmental performance is conducted each year end with senior management and the board of directors determining the ultimate amount of discretionary bonus pools we also review compensation throughout the year to determine how overall performance tracks against managers’ expectations management takes these and other factors including historical performance into account in reviewing accrued compensation estimates quarterly and adjusting accrual rates as appropriate because final reviews are not normally completed until after the yearend closing cycle it is possible that actual amounts ultimately approved could differ from amounts previously accrued based upon information available prior to the final reviews as such the difference if any will be recorded in the period in which the estimate is changed and would result in higher or lower expense 

  

forwardlooking factors 

  

dividend payment 

on august 16 2004 we announced a regular quarterly dividend of 007 per share the cash dividend was paid on september 21 2004 to common stockholders of record on august 31 2004 

  

   

income taxes 

in the normal course of business our tax filings are subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authorities audits by two tax authorities are presently ongoing although there is inherent uncertainty in the audit process we have no reason to believe that such audits will result in the payment of additional taxes or penalties or both that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position beyond current estimates 

  

market sensitivities 

we are exposed to various economic and financial risks associated with equity and foreign currency markets as well as risks related to interest rate fluctuations during the normal course of business the major equity indices for example dow jones 30 industrials russell 2000 ®  nasdaq composite ®  and msci european index have experienced significant volatility since march 2000 continued volatility in general economic and market conditions is still possible in the near future external factors such as the threat of terrorist activities or rising energy prices could undermine any potential continued economic recovery a decline in the worldwide markets could adversely impact a significant number of our clients primarily investment management firms and investment banks and increase the likelihood of personnel and spending reductions among our existing and potential clients continued investigations into the investment management industry by various regulatory bodies could have an adverse effect on our business a policy of persistent interest rate increases adopted by the federal reserve bank andor continued inflationary pressures could derail the current economic recovery and adversely affect the operations of our clients in addition changes to regulations regarding soft dollar payments could have a negative impact on our operations 

the fair market value of our investment portfolio at august 31 2004 was 195 million it is anticipated that the fair market value of our portfolio will continue to be immaterially affected by fluctuations in interest rates preservation of principal is the primary goal of our investment portfolio pursuant to our established investment guidelines thirdparty managers construct portfolios to achieve high levels of credit quality liquidity and diversification our investment policy dictates that the weightedaverage duration of shortterm investments may not exceed two years our investment guidelines do not permit us to invest in puts calls strips short sales straddles options or futures nor are we permitted to invest on margin because we have no outstanding longterm indebtedness and we have a restrictive investment policy our financial exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is expected to remain low
