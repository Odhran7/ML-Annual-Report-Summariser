k5 

intermodal – our intermodal commodity group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers these shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies international steamship lines premium customers and asset owning companies in 2021 we handled 41 million intermodal units which accounted for 28 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

coal – coal revenues accounted for 12 of our total railway operating revenues in 2021 we handled 73 million tons or 07 million carloads most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins with the balance from major western coal basins received via the memphis and chicago gateways our coal franchise supports the electric generation market serving approximately 50 coalfired power plants as well as the export domestic metallurgical and industrial markets primarily through direct rail and river lake and coastal facilities including various terminals on the ohio river lamberts point in norfolk virginia the port of baltimore and lake erie 

freight rates – our predominant pricing mechanisms private contracts and exempt price quotes are not subject to regulation in general market forces are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

railway property 

  

our railroad infrastructure makes us capital intensive with net properties of approximately 32 billion on a historical cost basis 

property additions – property additions for the past five years were as follows 



our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable rail transportation services 

k6

the following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at december 31 2021 

  

k7 

the following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at december 31 2021 and information regarding 2021 retirements 

  

track maintenance – of the 35300 total miles of track on which we operate we are responsible for maintaining 28700 miles with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance 

  

over 84 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard approximately 41 of our lines excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2021 

  

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding our track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years

environmental matters – compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is one of our principal goals to date such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or competitive position see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

human capital management 

workforce – we employed an average of 18500 employees during 2021 and 18100 employees at the end of 2021 approximately 80 of our railroad employees – referred to as “craft” employees – are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the remainder of our workforce is composed of management employees 

  

craft workforce levels and productivity – maintaining appropriate headcount levels for our craftemployee workforce is critical to our ontime and consistent delivery of customers’ goods and operational efficiency goals we manage this human capital metric through forecasting tools designed to ensure the optimal level of staffing to meet business demands while controlling costs we measure and monitor employee productivity based on gross ton miles per train and engine employee 

safety – we are dedicated to providing employees with a safe workplace and the knowledge and tools they need to work safely and return home safely every day our commitment to an injuryfree workplace is illustrated by our “ i am coming home ” safety message which is featured prominently in our yards shops and facilities and further reinforces the importance of working safely we measure employee safety performance through internal metrics such as losttime injuries and serious injuries per 200000 employeehours and metrics established by the federal 

k8 

railroad administration fra such as fra reportable injuries per 200000 employeehours given the importance of safety among our workforce and business in 2020 our board of directors established a standing safety committee that among other duties reviews monitors and evaluates our compliance with our safety programs and practices 

attracting and retaining management employees – our talent strategy for management employees is essential to attracting strong candidates in a competitive talent environment we evaluate the effectiveness of that strategy by studying market trends benchmarking the attractiveness of our employee value proposition and analyzing retention data 

we also focus on driving employee engagement which is key to increasing employee productivity retention and safety we take a datacentric approach including the use of quarterly surveys among management employees to identify new initiatives that will help boost engagement and drive business results 

employee development and training – we provide a range of developmental programs opportunities skills and resources for our employees to work safely and be successful in their careers we provide handson training and simulation training designed to improve training effectiveness and safety outcomes 

we also use modern learning and performance technologies to offer robust professional growth opportunities through ondemand digital course offerings custombuilt learning paths and performancemanagement tools our platforms deliver a contemporary convenient and inclusive approach to professional development 

diversity equity and inclusion – as a leading transportation service company we understand that competing in the global marketplace requires recruiting the most qualified talented and diverse people we strive to create a diverse equitable and inclusive workplace where a wide range of perspectives and experiences are represented valued and empowered to thrive 

while our current workforce reflects a broad range of backgrounds and experiences we continue to focus on building an even more diverse workforce using technologydriven outreach and multiple recruiting relationships to maintain a robust pipeline of diverse talent 

to underscore our commitment to cultivating a workplace experience where the unique experiences perspectives and contributions of all our people are valued our senior management team recently signed a pledge reaffirming our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion to advance that commitment senior leaders from across the company serve on an inclusion leadership council which is accountable for setting our enterprise inclusion strategy and articulating measurable goals and actions needed to achieve them 

government regulation – in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all business our railroads are subject to regulation by the us surface transportation board stb the stb has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb has jurisdiction to determine whether we are “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on the results of the prior year a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers 

  

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 included exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract approximately 90 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

k9 

efforts have been made over the past several years to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry and such efforts are expected to continue in 2022 the staggers rail act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

  

government regulations are further discussed within item 1a “risk factors” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition – there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprogress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

our primary rail competitor is csx corporation csx both we and csx operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory we also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations – we continue to enhance the security of our rail system our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry to mitigate the risk of terrorist violent extremist or seriously disruptive cyberattack increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

our security plan also complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and is integrated into hazardous material training programs additionally locationspecific security plans are in place for rail corridors in certain metropolitan areas referred to as high threat urban areas htua particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in a htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest 

we also operate five facilities that are under us coast guard uscg maritime security regulations with respect to these facilities each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and remains subject to inspection by the uscg 

additionally we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the transportation security administration the federal bureau of investigation the fra the uscg us customs and border protection the department of defense and various state homeland security offices 

in 2021 through the norfolk southern operation awareness and response program as well as participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response program we provided rail accident response 

k10 

training to approximately 3500 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel utilizing a combination of online training and facetoface training sessions in addition 2021 saw the return of the safety train tour we conducted an abbreviated sixstop safety train tour that provided handson training to approximately 700 first responders 

we also continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning with test scenarios that include cybersecurity attacks our riskbased information security program helps ensure our defenses and resources are aligned to address the most likely and most damaging potential attacks to provide support for our organizational mission and operational objectives and to keep us in the best position to detect mitigate and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks in a timely fashion 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements the information set forth in this item 1a “risk factors” should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report including 

item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

regulatory and legislative risks 

significant governmental legislation regulation and executive orders over commercial tax operating and environmental matters could affect us our customers and the markets we serve congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry similarly regulations promulgated by agencies and the issuance of executive orders can affect us our customers and the markets we serve railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to negotiate prices for rail services on railway operating revenues and on the efficiency of our operations such additional industry regulation as well as enactment of any new tax laws could also negatively impact cash flows from operating activities and therefore could result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot and the dhs which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety and security the rail safety improvement act of 2008 the surface transportation extension act of 2015 and the implementing regulations promulgated by the fra required us and each other class i railroad to implement an interoperable positive train control system ptc on main lines over which five million or more gross tons of annual traffic and certain hazardous materials are transported and on any main lines over which intercity or commuter rail passenger transportation is regularly provided we completed our ptc implementation prior to the december 31 2020 deadline ptc is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions speedrelated derailments and certain other accidents caused by human error but it will not prevent all types of train accidents or incidents the ptc system will continue to result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures and may result in increased claims and litigation costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions past present and future is inherent in the railroad business this risk includes property owned by us whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with 

k11 

respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time 

operational risks 

pandemics epidemics or endemic diseases could further impact us our customers our supply chain and our operations the magnitude and duration of a pandemic epidemic or endemic disease and its impact on our customers and general economic conditions will influence the demand for our services and affect our revenues in addition such outbreaks could affect our operations and business continuity if a significant number of our essential employees overall or in a key location are quarantined from contraction of or exposure to the disease or if governmental orders prevent our employees or critical suppliers including individuals that have not received mandated vaccinations from working our compliance with vaccine mandates could lead to employee absences resignations labor disputes or work stoppages the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted the economy and continues to generate economic uncertainty future pandemics epidemics or endemic diseases may cause similar consequences to the extent such diseases adversely affects our business and financial results they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors included herein or may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us 

a significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our business operations we rely on information technology and improvements in that technology in all aspects of our business if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of information technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption or other operational difficulties although we maintain comprehensive security programs designed to protect our information technology systems we are continually targeted by threat actors attempting to access our networks while we have experienced cybersecurity events that have had minimal impact future events may result in more significant impacts to business operations these potentially impactful events could include unauthorized access to our systems viruses ransomware andor compromise acquisition or destruction of our data we also could be impacted by cybersecurity events targeting third parties that we rely on for business operations including third party vendors that have access to our systems or data and third parties in our supply chain such a direct or indirect cybersecurity incident could interrupt our service cause safety failures or operational difficulties decrease revenues increase operating costs impact our efficiency damage our corporate reputation andor expose us to litigation or government investigations which could result in penalties fines or judgments in addition our failure to comply with privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in government investigations and proceedings against us or litigation resulting in adverse reputational impacts penalties and legal liability 

our business may be seriously harmed if we fail to develop implement maintain upgrade enhance protect and integrate our information technology systems if we do not have sufficient capital to develop acquire or implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing alternative modes of transportation service 

as a common carrier by rail we must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property including environmental damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network the costs of a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

we face competition from other transportation providers we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and quality and reliability of service while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements expenditures legislation or regulation materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate such as granting materially greater latitude 

k12 

for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete with other modes of transportation 

capacity constraints could negatively impact our service and operating efficiency we could experience capacity constraints on our rail network related to increased demand for rail services locomotive or employee shortages severe weather congestion on other railroads including passenger activities or impacts from changes to our network structure or composition such constraints could result in operational inefficiencies or adversely affect our operations 

significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and resources like locomotives changes in workforce demographics training requirements and availability of qualified personnel particularly for engineers and conductors could have a negative impact on our ability to meet shortterm demand for rail service unpredicted increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks and could negatively impact our operational efficiency 

constraints on the supply chain or the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon a functioning global supply chain and our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers including shortlines and regional railroads with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the supply chain or operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies additionally any significant consolidations mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach 

the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions if our craft employees were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits 

we may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets we consumed over 380 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2021 fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capitalintensive nature as well as the industryspecific requirements of the rail industry high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of 

k13 

locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials 

litigation risks 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded 

a catastrophic rail accident whether on our lines or another carrier’s involving any or all of release of hazardous materials freight loss property damage personal injury and environmental liability could compromise critical parts of our rail network losses associated with such an accident involving us could exceed our insurance coverage resulting in a material adverse effect on our liquidity any material changes to current litigation trends could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance 

we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

climate change risks 

severe weather and disasters have caused and could again cause significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena resulting from changing weather patterns and rising sea levels or other causes including hurricanes floods fires landslides extreme temperatures significant precipitation and earthquakes have caused and may again cause damage to our network our workforce to be unavailable and us to be unable to use our equipment additionally shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions which could cause more significant business interruptions that result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues 

concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease the amount of traffic we handle 

in addition legislation and regulation related to ghg emissions could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers even without legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghg emissions could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that 1 use commodities we carry to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy associated with ghg emissions 

macroeconomic and market risks 

we may be affected by general economic conditions negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions including reduced import and export volumes could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers 

we may be affected by energy prices volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including but not limited to the economy demand for transportation services business related to the energy sector including crude oil natural gas and coal fuel prices and fuel surcharges 

k14 

the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of debt instruments and the sale of certain receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial position due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial position alone or in combination could also result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in 2007 various antitrust class actions filed against us and other class i railroads in various federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the district of columbia by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in 2012 the court certified the case as a class action the defendant railroads appealed this certification and the court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for further consideration on october 10 2017 the district court denied class certification the decision was upheld by the court of appeals on august 16 2019 since that decision various individual cases have been filed in multiple jurisdictions and also consolidated in the district of columbia we believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases we do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

in 2018 a lawsuit was filed against one of our subsidiaries by the minority owner in a jointlyowned terminal railroad company in which our subsidiary has the majority ownership the lawsuit alleged violations of various state laws and federal antitrust laws it is reasonably possible that we could incur a loss in the case however we intend to vigorously defend the case and believe that we will prevail the potential range of loss cannot be estimated at this time

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies moving goods and materials that help drive the us economy we connect customers to markets and communities to economic opportunity with safe reliable and costeffective shipping solutions our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates in 22 states and the district of columbia we are a major transporter of industrial products including agriculture forest and consumer products chemicals and metals and construction materials in addition in the east we serve every major container port and operate the most extensive intermodal network we are also a principal carrier of coal automobiles and automotive parts 

during 2021 revenue growth and the absence of two prioryear charges resulted in substantial increases in operating income net income and earnings per share our current year results compare favorably to the prior year during which there was a pandemicinduced decline in demand which resulted in reduced earnings 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact the us and global economies and has resulted in ongoing supply chain challenges we are monitoring and reacting to the evolving nature of the pandemic governmental responses and their impacts on our business including employee availability we remain committed to protecting our employees operating safely and providing excellent transportation service products for our customers 

summarized results of operations 



income from railway operations increased in 2021 compared to 2020 the result of a 14 increase in railway operating revenues and a 1 reduction in railway operating expenses revenue growth was driven by increased average revenue per unit and higher volumes the result of improved customer demand the decline in railway operating expenses was largely due to the absence of two charges as 2020 results were adversely impacted by a 385 million loss on asset disposal related to locomotives and a 99 million impairment charge related to an equity method investment for more information on these charges see notes 7 and 6 respectively higher fuel costs purchased services and compensation and benefits expense mostly offset the reduction associated with these charges additionally gains on the sale of operating properties increased compared to the prior year the 48 increase in income from railway operations drove comparable increases in net income and diluted earnings per share our railway operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses decreased to 601 percent 

income from railway operations declined in 2020 compared to 2019 as railway operating revenues fell 13 which exceeded a 7 reduction in operating expenses railway operating revenues declined as lower customer demand resulted in reduced volume additionally negative mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by increased pricing led to lower average revenue per unit railway operating expenses decreased due to declines in 

k18 

fuel price and consumption reduced employment levels lower volumes and operational efficiency improvements these decreases in expenses were partially offset by the impact of the aforementioned charges 

the following tables adjust our 2020 us generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial results to exclude the effects of the loss on asset disposal and investment impairment the income tax effects on these nongaap adjustments were calculated based on the applicable tax rates to which the nongaap adjustments relate we use these nongaap financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the 2020 charges while we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies

revenues increased 14 billion in 2021 and decreased 15 billion in 2020 compared to the prior years higher revenue for 2021 was the result of increased average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains higher fuel surcharge revenue increased intermodal storage service charges and improved mix as well as volume growth in 2020 lower revenue was the result of decreased volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by pricing gains 

the table below reflects the components of the revenue change by major commodity group 



  

approximately 90 of our revenue base is covered by contracts that include negotiated fuel surcharges these revenues totaled 622 million 349 million and 578 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

merchandise revenues increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years in 2021 revenues rose due to increased volume and higher average revenue per unit driven by increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing volumes increased in all merchandise commodity groups reflecting continued economic recovery following the onset of the covid19 pandemic in 2020 revenues decreased due to volume declines in all commodity groups which were partially offset by higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains 

for 2022 merchandise revenues are expected to increase the result of higher revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and increased fuel surcharge revenue and higher volumes 

agriculture forest and consumer products revenues increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years in 2021 the rise was the result of higher volume across almost all markets as the economy has improved since the early months of the pandemic in 2020 and increased average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue gains in ethanol pulpboard beverages lumber and wood and woodchips more than offset declines in soybeans and pulp in 2020 the decline was the result of reduced volume partially offset by higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue volume declined due to the impact of covid19 on the demand for ethanol corn food service products and building industrial and commercial products 

in 2022 agriculture forest and consumer products revenues are expected to rise a result of increased volume and average revenue per unit increases resulting from pricing gains we expect volumes to increase in most markets led by corn soybeans pulpboard and feed 

chemicals revenues rose in 2021 and fell in 2020 compared with the prior years in 2021 the increase was the result of volume growth partially offset by lower average revenue per unit driven by mix of traffic the increase in volume was due to economic and production recovery since the beginning of the pandemic despite ongoing challenges in the energy markets the markets with the largest gains were solid waste industrial chemicals sand natural gas liquids and plastics in 2020 the decrease was the result of volume declines partially offset by higher average revenue per unit due to pricing gains volume declined due to the impact from covid19 and ongoing disruptions in the energy markets the onset of the pandemic created an overabundance of products in the market 

k21 

as companies reduced stockpiles before requiring more products oil and petroleum shipments were negatively impacted due to reductions in gasolinejet fuel demand and travel 

for 2022 chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase a result of higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and increased volume we expect carload increases in plastics solid waste and petroleum products to be partially offset by reduced volumes of inorganic chemicals 

  

metals and construction revenues were higher in 2021 but declined in 2020 compared with the prior years in 2021 revenue growth was driven by increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue volume increased across almost all markets due to economic improvement since the beginning of the pandemic the markets serving the metal production industry including coil steel scrap metal and iron and steel experienced the largest gains in 2020 volume declines were partially offset by higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains volume declines were largely the result of weakened demand due to reductions in metal and domestic vehicle production the onset of the pandemic caused industries to suspend production which heavily impacted customers’ needs for materials and shipping of finished and semifinished goods these declines were partially offset by increased demand for cement 

for 2022 metals and construction revenues are expected to rise a result of higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and increased volume as the economic recovery continues volume growth is expected in almost all markets led by aggregates coil steel scrap metal and construction 

automotive revenues rose in 2021 but were lower in 2020 compared with the prior years the increase in revenues in 2021 were driven by volume growth and higher average revenue per unit driven by an increase in fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains automotive volumes were higher due primarily to increased retail demand and the impact of prioryear pandemicinduced production shutdowns this was partially offset by the impact of the microchip shortage on production in 2020 revenue declines were driven by lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by pricing gains the volume decline was mostly the result of unplanned automotive plant shutdowns in the first half of the year primarily due to the covid19 pandemic which was partially offset by increased demand in the second half of the year 

in 2022 automotive revenues are expected to increase as a result of higher volume as inventories replenish and increased average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains 

intermodal revenues increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years the rise in 2021 was primarily the result of higher average revenue per unit driven by increased storage service charges higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains the decline in 2020 was driven by lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue which were partially offset by pricing gains and favorable mix 

for 2022 we expect intermodal revenues to rise the result of increased volume higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains partially offset by lower storage service charges 

intermodal units by market were as follows 

k22 

domestic volume increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years volume rose due to strong consumer demand which was partially offset by overall supply chain congestion including chassis availability issues in 2020 volume declined due to supply chain disruptions related to the onset of the pandemic and strong overtheroad competition in the first half of the year inventory replenishment and a strong peak season in the second half of the year assisted in dampening the overall volume decline 

for 2022 we expect higher domestic volume driven by new business and growth from existing customers 

international volume rose in 2021 but fell in 2020 the increase in 2021 was the result of continued strong import demand despite being limited by various supply chain constraints including chassis availability issues the decline in 2020 resulted from supply chain disruptions due to the onset of the pandemic 

for 2022 we expect international volume growth due to increased demand and supply chain recovery 

  

coal revenues increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years the increase in 2021 was due to increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and positive mix the decrease in 2020 was a result of significant volume declines 

for 2022 we expect coal revenues to decline due to lower average revenue per unit and decreased volume driven by coal supply challenges 

as shown in the following table total tonnage increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 

   

utility coal tonnage increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years the increase in 2021 was due to higher natural gas prices and increased demand from coalsourced electrical generation the decline in 2020 was due to low natural gas prices diminished industrial and commercial electricity demand and high stockpiles 

for 2022 utility coal tonnage is expected to decline due to higher coal prices lower natural gas prices uncertainty regarding coal production and impacts of weather on demand 

export coal tonnage increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years the increase in 2021 was a result of strong seaborne pricing improved global economic conditions and greater global demand the decline in 2020 was a result of weak seaborne pricing covid19related global disruptions and import restrictions 

for 2022 export coal tonnage is expected to decrease due to uncertainty regarding the global coal market and tight coal supply availability 

  

domestic metallurgical coal tonnage increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years the increase in 2021 was the result of strong recovery in the steel market the decrease in 2020 was a reflection of reduced domestic steel demand which led to idled customer facilities and lower production 

k23 

for 2022 domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to decrease due to customer sourcing challenges and tight coal supply availability 

industrial coal tonnage increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years the increase in 2021 was a result of improved demand the decrease in 2020 was driven by pressure from natural gas conversions and customer sourcing changes 

for 2022 industrial coal tonnage is expected to decrease due to continued natural gas conversions and coal supply sourcing challenges 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications were as follows 



in 2021 expenses declined primarily as a result of the absence of the 2020 loss on asset disposal and the equity method investment impairment charge which is included in purchased services and rents this was partially offset by higher fuel costs increased other purchased services and higher compensation and benefits expense in 2020 expenses fell as our strategic initiatives to improve productivity and asset utilization resulted in lower compensation and benefits expense declines in fuel consumption reduced purchased services and lower materials expense fuel expense also declined due to lower prices these expense reductions were partially offset by the loss on asset disposal and impairment charge previously discussed 

compensation and benefits increased in 2021 reflecting changes in 

• incentive and stockbased compensation up 128 million 

• overtime and recrews up 47 million 

• increased pay rates up 41 million 

• health and welfare benefits for craft employees down 19 million 

• employment levels down 154 million and 

• other up 26 million 

k24 

in 2020 compensation and benefits decreased a result of changes in 

• employment levels down 309 million 

• health and welfare benefits for craft employees down 77 million 

• overtime and recrews down 54 million 

• incentive and stockbased compensation down 38 million 

• increased pay rates up 50 million 

• lower capitalized labor additional expense of 51 million and 

• other down 1 million 

our employment averaged 18500 in 2021 compared with 20200 in 2020 and 24600 in 2019 

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from external vendors and contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals 



the increase in purchased services in 2021 was due to increased technology costs higher intermodalrelated expenses and increased conrail costs this was partially offset by the absence of a prior year 99 million impairment related to an equity method investment the decrease in purchased services in 2020 resulted from volumerelated declines and strategic initiatives to improve productivity and asset utilization partially offset by the impairment of an equity method investment 

equipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment increased in both periods in 2021 equipment rents were higher for generaluse equipment due to decreased network velocity and increased volume these increases were partially offset by lower intermodal costs and higher equity in ttx earnings in 2020 the increase was primarily the result of lower equity in ttx earnings and increased automotive equipment expenses partially offset by decreased intermodal equipment expenses 

fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations increased in 2021 but decreased in 2020 compared with the prior years the increase in 2021 was primarily due to locomotive fuel prices up 43 which increased expenses 224 million additionally locomotive fuel consumption increased 4 the decline in 2020 was primarily due to locomotive fuel prices down 32 which decreased expenses 235 million we consumed 384 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2021 compared with 368 million gallons in 2020 and 451 million gallons in 2019 

depreciation expense increased in both periods a reflection of reinvestment in our infrastructure rolling stock and technology 

k25 

materials and other expenses decreased in both periods as shown in the following table 



  

materials expense decreased in both periods due primarily to lower maintenance requirements as a result of fewer locomotives and freight cars in service 

claims expense includes costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters the decrease in 2021 was primarily the result of lower costs associated with derailments and personal injuries in 2020 claims expense declined the result of lower costs related to environmental remediation matters that were partially offset by increased derailment costs 

other expense decreased in 2021 primarily due to higher gains from sales of operating property gains from operating property sales amounted to 82 million 26 million and 64 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively in 2020 other expense decreased largely due to the absence of the 2019 writeoff of a 32 million receivable as a result of a legal dispute additionally 2020 benefited from reduced travel expenses resulting from the covid19 pandemic these reductions were partially offset by lower gains from sales of operating property 

loss on asset disposal 

during 2020 we recorded a 385 million charge related to the disposal of 703 locomotives for more information on the impact of the charge see note 7 

other income – net 

other income – net decreased in 2021 but increased in 2020 other income fell in 2021 due to lower net returns on corporateowned life insurance coli and lower gains on sales of nonoperating property the increase in 2020 was driven by the absence of a prior year 49 million impairment loss related to natural resource assets lower pension and postretirement benefit expenses and higher returns on coli investments which more than offset the absence of coal royalties and lower gains on sales of nonoperating property 

income taxes 

  

the effective income tax rate was 225 in 2021 compared with 204 in 2020 and 220 in 2019 all three years benefited from favorable tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and coli returns the current year benefited from a reduction in deferred taxes associated with state tax law change s  while 2020 benefited from a reduction of taxes upon the resolution of our 2012 amended return see note 4 

for 2022 we expect an effective income tax rate between 23 and 24 

k26 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities our principal source of liquidity was 43 billion in 2021 36 billion in 2020 and 39 billion in 2019 the increase in 2021 was primarily the result of improved operating results the decline in 2020 reflected a decrease in income from railway operations offset in part by lower income tax payments we had negative working capital of 354 million at december 31 2021 and working capital of 158 million at december 31 2020 cash and cash equivalents totaled 839 million and 11 billion at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations in addition we believe our currentlyavailable borrowing capacity access to additional financing and ability to reduce property additions and shareholder distributions including share repurchases provide additional flexibility to meet our ongoing obligations nonetheless we continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic which could lead to a reduction in cash flows from operations 

contractual obligations at december 31 2021 including those that may have material cash requirements include interest on fixedrate longterm debt longterm debt note 9 unconditional purchase obligations note 17 longterm advances from conrail inc conrail note 6 operating leases note 10 agreements with consolidated rail corporation crc note 6 and unrecognized tax benefits note 4 



  

 this amount is shown in the other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of unrecognized obligations including unconditional purchase obligations and future interest payments on fixedrate longterm debt which are included in the table above 

  

cash used in investing activities was 12 billion in both 2021 and 2020 and 18 billion in 2019 in 2021 lower proceeds from property sales were mostly offset by reduced coli policy loan repayments and lower property additions in 2020 the decrease was primarily driven by lower property additions 

capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the “railway property” section of part i of this report on form 10k for 2022 we expect property additions will be between 18 billion and 19 billion 

cash used in financing activities was 33 billion in 2021 compared with 19 billion in 2020 and 20 billion in 2019 the increase in 2021 reflects higher repurchases of common stock and debt repayments partially offset by increased proceeds from borrowings in 2020 the change reflects lower repurchases of common stock and debt repayments partially offset by reduced proceeds from borrowings 

share repurchases of 34 billion in 2021 14 billion in 2020 and 21 billion in 2019 resulted in the retirement of 127 million 74 million and 113 million shares respectively as of december 31 2021 80 million shares remain authorized by our board of directors for repurchase the timing and volume of future share repurchases 

k27 

will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors repurchases may be executed in the open market through derivatives accelerated repurchase and other negotiated transactions and through plans designed to comply with rule 10b51c under the securities and exchange act of 1934 any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash cash on hand or proceeds from borrowings 

in august 2021 we issued 600 million of 290 senior notes due 2051 

in may 2021 we issued 500 million of 230 senior notes due 2031 and 600 million of 410 senior notes due 2121 the net proceeds of the 230 senior notes due 2031 will be used to finance or refinance in whole or in part new or existing eligible projects with environmental benefits as outlined in our green financing framework 

in may 2021 we renewed amended and restated our accounts receivable securitization program with a maximum borrowing capacity of 400 million the term expires in may 2022 we had no amounts outstanding under this program and our available borrowing capacity was 400 million at both december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 

we also have in place and available an 800 million credit agreement expiring in march 2025 which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants we had no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2021 or december 31 2020 in addition we have investments in general purpose coli policies and had the ability to borrow against these policies up to 715 million and 750 million at december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively 

we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 9 and we have authority from our board of directors to issue an additional 30 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise our debttototal capitalization ratio was 504 at december 31 2021 compared with 462 at december 31 2020 

  

upcoming annual debt maturities are disclosed in note 9 overall our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the following critical accounting estimates are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note 12 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities 

  

k28 

for 2021 we assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 80 which was supported by our longterm total rate of return on pension plan assets since inception as well as our expectation of future returns a onepercentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 27 million change in annual pension expense we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans a onepercentage point change to this discount rate assumption would result in a 20 million change in annual pension expense 

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our assets are longlived railway properties note 7 “properties” are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of assumptions and estimates 

expenditures including those on leased assets that extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials labor and other direct costs in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project a significant portion of our annual capital spending relates to selfconstructed assets costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that in our judgment do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed 

  

depreciation expense for 2021 totaled 12 billion our composite depreciation rates for 2021 are disclosed in note 7 a oneyear increase or decrease in the estimated average useful lives of depreciable assets would have resulted in an approximate 45 million decrease or increase to annual depreciation expense 

personal injury 

  

claims expense included in “materials and other” in the consolidated statements of income includes our estimate of costs for personal injuries 

  

to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year we utilize studies prepared by an independent actuarial consulting firm the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study the accuracy of our estimate of the liability is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded 

see note 17 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates we use for personal injury 

income taxes 

  

our net deferred tax liability totaled 72 billion at december 31 2021 note 4 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we have a 60 million valuation allowance on 461 million of 

k29 

deferred tax assets as of december 31 2021 reflecting the expectation that substantially all of these assets will be realized 

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions pursuant to the railway labor act these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the railway labor act are completed we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements the current round of bargaining commenced on november 1 2019 with both management and the unions serving their formal proposals for changes to the collective bargaining agreements and negotiations are ongoing 

market risks 

  

at december 31 2021 we had no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a onepercentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2021 and amounts to an increase of approximately 19 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2021 we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 1 

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in longlived assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results levels of activity performance or our achievements or those of our industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forwardlooking statements in some cases forwardlooking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may” “will” “could” “would” “should” “expect” “plan” “anticipate” “intend” “believe” “estimate” “project” “consider” “predict” “potential” “feel” or other comparable terminology we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations assumptions estimates beliefs and projections while we believe these expectations assumptions estimates beliefs and projections are reasonable such forwardlooking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control these and other important factors including those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements herein are made only as of the date they were first issued and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

freight rates – our predominant pricing mechanisms private contracts and exempt price quotes are not subject to regulation in general market forces are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

railway property 

  

our railroad infrastructure makes us capital intensive with net properties of approximately 31 billion on a historical cost basis 

property additions – property additions for the past five years were as follows 



our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable rail transportation services

environmental matters – compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is one of our principal goals to date such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or competitive position see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

human capital management 

workforce – we employed an average of 20200 employees during 2020 and 19100 employees at the end of 2020 approximately 80 of our railroad employees – referred to as “craft” employees – are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the remainder of our workforce is composed of management employees 

  

craft workforce levels and productivity – maintaining appropriate headcount levels for our craftemployee workforce is critical to our ontime and consistent delivery of customers’ goods and operational efficiency goals we manage this human capital metric through forecasting tools designed to ensure the optimal level of staffing to meet business demands while controlling costs we measure and monitor employee productivity based on gross ton miles per train and engine employee 

safety – we are dedicated to providing employees with a safe workplace and the knowledge and tools they need to work safely and return home safely every day our commitment to an injuryfree workplace is illustrated by our “ i am coming home ” safety message which is featured prominently in our yards shops and facilities and further reinforces the importance of working safely we measure employee safety performance through internal metrics 

k8 

such as losttime injuries and serious injuries per 200000 employeehours and metrics established by the federal railroad administration fra such as fra reportable injuries per 200000 employeehours given the importance of safety among our workforce and business in 2020 our board of directors established a standing safety committee that among other duties reviews monitors and evaluates our compliance with our safety programs and practices 

attracting and retaining management employees – our talent strategy for management employees is essential to attracting strong candidates in a competitive talent environment we evaluate the effectiveness of that strategy by studying market trends benchmarking the attractiveness of our employee value proposition and analyzing retention data 

we also focus on driving employee engagement which is key to increasing employee productivity retention and safety we take a datacentric approach including the use of quarterly surveys among management employees to identify new initiatives that will help boost engagement and drive business results 

employee development and training – we provide a range of developmental programs opportunities skills and resources for our employees to work safely and be successful in their careers we provide handson training and simulation training designed to improve training effectiveness and safety outcomes 

we also use modern learning and performance technologies to offer robust professional growth opportunities through ondemand digital course offerings custombuilt learning paths and performancemanagement tools our platforms deliver a contemporary convenient and inclusive approach to professional development 

diversity equity and inclusion – as a leading transportation service company we understand that competing in the global marketplace requires recruiting the most qualified talented and diverse people we strive to create a diverse equitable and inclusive workplace where a wide range of perspectives and experiences are represented valued and empowered to thrive 

while our current workforce reflects a broad range of backgrounds and experiences we continue to focus on building an even more diverse workforce using technologydriven outreach and multiple recruiting relationships to maintain a robust pipeline of diverse talent 

to underscore our commitment to cultivating a workplace experience where the unique experiences perspectives and contributions of all our people are valued our senior management team recently signed a pledge reaffirming our commitment to diversity equity and inclusion to advance that commitment senior leaders from across the company serve on an inclusion leadership council which is accountable for setting our enterprise inclusion strategy and articulating measurable goals and actions needed to achieve them 

government regulation – in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all business our railroads are subject to regulation by the us surface transportation board stb the stb has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb has jurisdiction to determine whether we are “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on the results of the prior year a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers 

  

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 included exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract approximately 90 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

k9 

efforts have been made over the past several years to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry and such efforts are expected to continue in 2021 the staggers rail act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

  

government regulations are further discussed within item 1a “risk factors” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition – there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprogress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

our primary rail competitor is csx corporation csx both we and csx operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory we also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations – we continue to enhance the security of our rail system our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry to mitigate the risk of terrorist violent extremist or seriously disruptive cyberattack increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

our security plan also complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and is integrated into hazardous material training programs additionally locationspecific security plans are in place for rail corridors in certain metropolitan areas referred to as high threat urban areas htua particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in a htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest 

we also operate six facilities that are under us coast guard uscg maritime security regulations with respect to these facilities each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and remains subject to inspection by the uscg 

additionally we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the transportation security administration the federal bureau of investigation the fra the uscg us customs and border protection the department of defense and various state homeland security offices 

in 2020 the covid19 pandemic led to cancellation of all facetoface training including the safety train tour as part of our operation awareness and response program as well as participation in the transportation community 

k10 

awareness and emergency response program the need to provide training to first responders did not go away our hazmat group adapted and created online training courses as well as conducted training webinars for first responders even with the adverse conditions of 2020 we provided rail accident response training to approximately 1000 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel 

we also continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning with test scenarios that include cybersecurity attacks our riskbased information security program helps ensure our defenses and resources are aligned to address the most likely and most damaging potential attacks to provide support for our organizational mission and operational objectives and to keep us in the best position to detect mitigate and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks in a timely fashion 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements the information set forth in this item 1a “risk factors” should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report including 

item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

regulatory risks 

significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial tax operating and environmental matters could affect us our customers and the markets we serve congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to negotiate prices for rail services on railway operating revenues and on the efficiency of our operations such additional industry regulation as well as enactment of any new tax laws could also negatively impact cash flows from operating activities and therefore could result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot and the dhs which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety and security the rail safety improvement act of 2008 the surface transportation extension act of 2015 and the implementing regulations promulgated by the fra collectively “the ptc laws and regulations” required us and each other class i railroad to implement an interoperable positive train control system ptc on main lines over which five million or more gross tons of annual traffic and certain hazardous materials are transported and on any main lines over which intercity or commuter rail passenger transportation is regularly provided we completed our ptc implementation prior to the december 31 2020 deadline ptc is installed on 8000 of our 19300 routes miles ptc is designed to prevent traintotrain collisions speedrelated derailments and certain other accidents caused by human error but it will not prevent all types of train accidents or incidents the ptc system will continue to result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures and may result in increased claims and litigation costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions past present and future is inherent in the railroad business this risk includes property owned by us whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

k11 

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time 

operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic could further impact us our customers our supply chain and our operations the pandemic has negatively impacted the economy and continues to generate significant economic uncertainty the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its impact on our customers and general economic conditions will influence the demand for our services and affect our revenues in addition covid19 could affect our operations and business continuity if a significant number of our essential employees overall or in a key location are quarantined from contraction of or exposure to the disease or if governmental orders prevent our operating employees or critical suppliers from working to the extent covid19 adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors included herein 

as a common carrier by rail we must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property including environmental damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network the costs of a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

we face competition from other transportation providers we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and quality and reliability of service while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements expenditures legislation or regulation materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate such as granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete with other modes of transportation 

capacity constraints could negatively impact our service and operating efficiency we could experience capacity constraints on our rail network related to increased demand for rail services locomotive or employee shortages severe weather congestion on other railroads including passenger activities or impacts from changes to our network structure or composition such constraints could result in operational inefficiencies or adversely affect our operations 

significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and resources like locomotives changes in workforce demographics training requirements and availability of qualified personnel particularly for engineers and conductors could have a negative impact on our ability to meet shortterm demand for rail service unpredicted increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks and could negatively impact our operational efficiency 

the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers including shortlines and regional railroads with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies additionally any significant consolidations mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach 

k12 

the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits 

we may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets we consumed approximately 368 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2020 fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capital intensive nature as well as the industryspecific requirements of the rail industry high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials 

litigation risks 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded 

a catastrophic rail accident whether on our lines or another carrier’s involving any or all of release of hazardous materials freight loss property damage personal injury and environmental liability could compromise critical parts of our rail network losses associated with such an accident involving us could exceed our insurance coverage resulting in a material adverse effect on our liquidity any material changes to current litigation trends could also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance 

we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

k13 

climate change risks 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues 

concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs and decrease the amount of traffic we handle 

in addition legislation and regulation related to ghgs could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers even without legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that 1 use commodities we carry to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy 

general risks 

we may be affected by general economic conditions prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions including reduced import and export volumes could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers 

we may be affected by energy prices volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including but not limited to the economy demand for transportation services business related to the energy sector including crude oil natural gas and coal fuel prices and fuel surcharges 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption a security breach or other operational difficulties we also face cybersecurity threats which may result in breaches of systems or compromises of sensitive data which may also result in service interruptions safety failures or operational difficulties such a breach or compromise could decrease revenues increase operating costs including those to protect our infrastructure impact our efficiency or damage our corporate reputation additionally if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing alternative modes of transportation service 

the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of debt instruments and the sale of certain receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial position due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial position alone or in combination could also result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in 2007 various antitrust class actions filed against us and other class i railroads in various federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the district of columbia by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in 2012 the court certified the case as a class action the defendant railroads appealed this certification and the court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for further consideration on october 10 2017 the district court denied class certification the decision was upheld by the court of appeals on august 16 2019 since that decision various individual cases have been filed in multiple jurisdictions and also consolidated in the district of columbia we believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases we do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

in 2018 a lawsuit was filed against one of our subsidiaries by the minority owner in a jointlyowned terminal 

railroad company in which our subsidiary has the majority ownership the lawsuit alleged violations of various 

state laws and federal antitrust laws it is reasonably possible that we could incur a loss in the case however we 

intend to vigorously defend the case and believe that we will prevail the potential range of loss cannot be 

estimated at this time

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 19300 route miles in 22 states and the district of columbia serves every major container port in the eastern us and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers we are a major transporter of industrial products including agriculture forest and consumer products chemicals and metals and construction materials in addition we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a principal carrier of coal automobiles and automotive parts 

in 2020 we continued the implementation of our strategic plan including tactical changes to our operating plan to generate operational efficiencies improve customer service and deliver strong financial results the covid19 pandemic caused significant economic disruption and along with softening energy markets reduced the demand for our services nevertheless we executed on operational initiatives to generate efficiencies and lower our cost structure in the face of economic headwinds that resulted in a yearoveryear volume decline of 12 we improved productivity by driving yearoveryear average headcount down by 18 and we increased asset utilization through rationalization of our locomotive fleet these sustainable cost structure improvements will provide greater benefits as the economy recovers however there is still substantial uncertainty as to the pace of economic recovery and the continued effects of the pandemic on our results of operations we continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our employees’ availability and remain committed to protecting our employees and providing excellent transportation service products for our customers 

summarized results of operations 



income from railway operations declined in 2020 compared to 2019 as railway operating revenues fell 13 which exceeded a 7 reduction in operating expenses railway operating revenues declined as lower customer demand resulted in volume reductions additionally negative mix and lower fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by increased pricing led to lower revenue per unit railway operating expenses decreased due to declines in fuel price and consumption reduced employment levels lower volumes and operational efficiency improvements additionally 2020 results were adversely impacted by a loss on asset disposal of 385 million related to locomotives sold and by a 99 million impairment charge related to an equity method investment for more information on the impact of these charges see notes 7 and 6 respectively 

income from railway operations rose in 2019 compared to 2018 as a 3 reduction in railway operating expenses more than offset the impact of a 1 decline in railway operating revenues in addition to higher income from railway operations net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2019 also benefited from a lower effective 

k19 

tax rate our continuing share repurchase program contributed to diluted earnings per share growth that exceeded that of net income 

the following tables adjust our 2020 us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” financial results to exclude the effects of the aforementioned charges the income tax effects on the nongaap adjustments were calculated based on the applicable tax rates to which the nongaap adjustments relate we use these nongaap financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the 2020 charges while we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

the following tables present a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes units and average revenue per unit by major commodity group 







k21 

at the beginning of 2020 we combined the agriculture products and forest and consumer commodity groups in addition we also made changes in the categorization of certain other commodity groups within merchandise prior period railway operating revenues units and revenue per unit have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation see note 2 

revenues decreased 15 billion in 2020 and 162 million in 2019 compared to the prior years as reflected in the table below lower revenues for both years were the result of decreased volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by pricing gains 

the table below reflects the components of the revenue change by major commodity group 



  

approximately 90 of our revenue base is covered by contracts that include negotiated fuel surcharges these revenues totaled 349 million 578 million and 657 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

merchandise revenues decreased in 2020 but increased in 2019 compared with the prior years in 2020 revenues decreased due to volume declines in all commodity groups which were partially offset by higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains in 2019 revenues grew due to higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains which were partially offset by volume declines in all commodity groups 

for 2021 merchandise revenues are expected to increase the result of higher volume as the market continues to recover from the impact of the covid19 pandemic and increased revenue per unit driven by pricing gains 

agriculture forest and consumer products revenues decreased in 2020 but increased in 2019 compared with the prior years in 2020 the decline was the result of reduced volume partially offset by higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue volume declined due to the impact of covid19 on the demand for ethanol corn food service products and building industrial and commercial products revenue growth in 2019 was due to higher average revenue per unit a result of pricing gains which more than offset volume declines volume was down due to decreased shipments of ethanol pulpboard lumber soybeans pulp woodchips canned goods and fertilizer partially offset by increased corn shipments 

in 2021 agriculture forest and consumer products revenues are expected to rise a result of increased volume as the economic recovery continues and revenue per unit increases resulting from pricing gains we expect volumes to increase in most markets led by ethanol corn pulpboard and food services 

chemicals revenues fell in 2020 but rose slightly in 2019 compared with the prior years in 2020 the decrease was the result of volume declines partially offset by higher average revenue per unit due to pricing gains volume declined due to the impact from covid19 and ongoing disruptions in the energy market the pandemic created an overabundance of products in the market as companies reduced stockpiles before requiring more products oil and petroleum shipments were negatively impacted due to reductions in gasolinejet fuel demand and travel in 

k22 

2019 the rise was the result of higher average revenue per unit due to pricing gains which were partially offset by volume declines volume declines in natural gas sand petroleum products organic and inorganic chemicals and plastics were partially offset by gains in crude oil and municipal waste 

for 2021 chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as a result of increased volume and revenue per unit driven by pricing gains we expect carloads to increase due to growth in plastics organic chemicals petroleum products and solid waste which is projected to be partially offset by reduced volumes of sand crude oil and natural gas liquids 

  

metals and construction revenues declined in both periods in 2020 volume declines were partially offset by higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains volume declines were largely the result of weakened demand due to reductions in metal and domestic vehicle production the pandemic caused industries to suspend production which heavily impacted customers’ needs for materials and shipping of finished and semifinished goods these declines were partially offset by increased demand for cement in 2019 volume declines were largely offset by higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains volume declines in iron and steel coil scrap metal and kaolin were partially offset by increases in aggregates shipments due to improved service and market strength 

for 2021 metals and construction revenues are expected to rise a result of increased volume and revenue per unit driven by pricing gains as the economic recovery continues volume growth is expected in almost all markets led by scrap metal coil iron and steel and construction 

automotive revenues declined in 2020 but were flat in 2019 compared with the prior years in 2020 revenue declines were driven by lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by pricing gains the volume decline was mostly the result of unplanned automotive plant shutdowns in the first half of the year primarily due to the covid19 pandemic which was partially offset by increased demand in the second half of the year in 2019 higher average revenue per unit driven by price increases offset volume declines that were primarily the result of decreases in us light vehicle production and the united automobile workers strike in the fourth quarter 

in 2021 automotive revenues are expected to increase as a result of higher volume as inventories continue to rebuild 

intermodal revenues decreased in both periods the decline in 2020 was driven by lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue which were partially offset by pricing gains and favorable mix the decline in 2019 was driven by lower volume which was partially offset by higher average revenue per unit a result of pricing gains 

for 2021 we expect intermodal revenues to rise the result of increased demand expected highway conversions and higher fuel surcharge revenue 

intermodal units by market were as follows 



domestic volume fell in both periods while volume rebounded in the second half of 2020 due to inventory replenishment and a strong peak season volume for the year was challenged by supply chain disruptions related to 

k23 

covid19 and strong overtheroad competition in the first half of the year volume was challenged in 2019 by stronger overtheroad competition 

for 2021 we expect higher domestic volume driven by growth from new and existing customers and continued highway conversions 

international volume fell in 2020 but rose in 2019 the decline in 2020 resulted from supply chain disruptions due to covid19 the rise in 2019 was due to increased demand from new and existing customers partially offset by lower shipments due to tariff concerns 

for 2021 we expect international volume growth as demand and trade continue to recover 

  

coal revenues decreased in both periods the decrease in 2020 was a result of significant volume declines the decrease in 2019 was a result of lower volume which was partially offset by higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains 

for 2021 we expect coal revenues to decline we anticipate overall coal volume to be down as continued declines in utility are projected to more than offset domestic metallurgical and export gains 

as shown in the following table total tonnage decreased in both periods 



utility coal tonnage decreased in both periods the decline in 2020 was due to low natural gas prices diminished industrial and commercial electricity demand and high stockpiles the decline in 2019 was due to continued headwinds from low natural gas prices and additional natural gas and renewable energy generating capacity which were slightly offset by customer inventory rebuilding 

for 2021 utility coal tonnage is expected to decrease as a result of high stockpiles and continued pressure from natural gas and renewable energy 

export coal tonnage decreased in both periods the decline in 2020 was a result of weak seaborne pricing covid19related global disruptions and import restrictions the decline in 2019 was a result of weak thermal seaborne pricing and coal supply disruptions at certain mines 

for 2021 export coal tonnage is expected to increase due to the global recovery from covid19 

  

domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was down in both years the decline in 2020 was a reflection of continued reduced domestic steel demand which led to idled customer facilities and lower production the decline in 2019 was a reflection of challenging overall market conditions including softening domestic steel demand customer sourcing changes and plant outages 

for 2021 domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to increase due to the recovery from covid19 

k24 

industrial coal tonnage decreased in both years driven by pressure from natural gas conversions and customer sourcing changes 

for 2021 industrial coal tonnage is expected to decrease as a result of continued pressure from natural gas conversions and customer sourcing changes 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications were as follows 



in 2020 expenses fell as our strategic initiatives to improve productivity and asset utilization resulted in lower compensation and benefits expense declines in fuel consumption reduced purchased services and lower materials expense fuel expense also declined due to lower prices these expense reductions were partially offset by a loss on asset disposal of 385 million related to locomotives sold and a 99 million impairment charge included in purchased services and rents related to an equity method investment in 2019 expenses fell as our strategic initiatives to improve productivity resulted in lower compensation equipment rents and materials expense these decreases along with lower fuel prices and consumption were partially offset by lower gains on operating property sales increased depreciation and a writeoff of a 32 million receivable as a result of a legal dispute 

compensation and benefits decreased in 2020 reflecting changes in 

• employment levels down 309 million 

• health and welfare benefits for craft employees down 77 million 

• overtime and recrews down 54 million 

• incentive and stockbased compensation down 38 million 

• increased pay rates up 50 million 

• lower capitalized labor additional expense of 51 million and 

• other down 1 million 

k25 

in 2019 compensation and benefits decreased a result of changes in 

• employment levels down 117 million 

• incentive and stockbased compensation down 83 million 

• overtime and recrews down 45 million 

• higher capitalized labor reduced expense of 9 million 

• 2018 employment tax refund 31 million unfavorable in 2019 

• pay rates up 76 million and 

• other down 27 million 

our employment averaged 20200 in 2020 compared with 24600 in 2019 and 26700 in 2018 

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from external vendors and contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals 



the decrease in purchased services in 2020 resulted from volumerelated declines and strategic initiatives to improve productivity and asset utilization partially offset by the 99 million impairment related to an equity method investment the increase in purchased services in 2019 was the result of increased technologyrelated costs expenses associated with our headquarters relocation and increased intermodalrelated costs partially offset by decreased transportation activities 

equipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment increased in 2020 but decreased in 2019 in 2020 the increase was primarily the result of lower equity in ttx earnings and increased automotive equipment expenses partially offset by decreased intermodal equipment expenses in 2019 the decrease was largely due to improved network velocity and the absence of shortterm locomotive resource costs incurred in the prior year 

fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations decreased in both periods the change in both years was due to lower locomotive fuel prices down 32 in 2020 and 8 in 2019 which decreased expenses by 235 million in 2020 and 82 million in 2019 additionally locomotive fuel consumption decreased 18 in 2020 and 4 in 2019 we consumed approximately 368 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2020 compared with 451 million gallons in 2019 and 472 million gallons in 2018 

depreciation expense increased in both periods a reflection of reinvestment in our infrastructure rolling stock and technology 

k26 

materials and other expenses decreased in 2020 but increased in 2019 as shown in the following table 



  

materials expense decreased in 2020 and 2019 due primarily to lower maintenance requirements as a result of fewer locomotives and freight cars in service 

claims expense includes costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters the 2020 expense declined primarily the result of lower costs related to environmental remediation matters partially offset by increased derailment costs the 2019 expense increased primarily due to higher costs related to environmental remediation matters and personal injury claims 

other expense decreased in 2020 largely due to the absence of the 2019 writeoff of a 32 million receivable as a result of a legal dispute additionally 2020 benefited from reduced travel expenses resulting from the covid19 pandemic these reductions were partially offset by lower gains from sales of operating property other expense increased in 2019 primarily due to lower gains from sales of operating property and the 32 million writeoff gains from operating property sales amounted to 26 million 64 million and 158 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

loss on asset disposal 

during 2020 we recorded a 385 million charge related to the disposal of 703 locomotives the sales of which were completed during the fourth quarter for more information on the impact of the charge see note 7 

other income – net 

other income – net increased in 2020 and 2019 the increase in 2020 was driven by the absence of the prior year 49 million impairment loss related to natural resource assets that were sold in 2020 lower pension and postretirement benefit expenses and higher returns on corporateowned life insurance “coli” investments which more than offset the absence of coal royalties and lower gains on sales of nonoperating property the increase in 2019 was driven by higher coli returns and increased gains on sales of nonoperating property which more than offset the aforementioned 49 million impairment loss 

income taxes 

  

the effective income tax rate was 204 in 2020 compared with 220 in 2019 and 231 in 2018 the current year benefited from a reduction of taxes upon the resolution of our 2012 amended return see note 4 all three years benefited from favorable tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and coli returns 

for 2021 we expect an effective income tax rate between 23 and 24 

k27 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities our principal source of liquidity was 36 billion in 2020 39 billion in 2019 and 37 billion in 2018 the decline in 2020 reflects a decrease in income from railway operations offset in part by lower income tax payments the increase in 2019 was primarily the result of improved operating results we had working capital of 158 million and negative working capital of 219 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively cash and cash equivalents totaled 11 billion and 580 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations in addition we believe our currentlyavailable borrowing capacity access to additional financing and ability to reduce property additions and shareholder distributions including share repurchases provide additional flexibility to meet our ongoing obligations nonetheless we continue to monitor the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic which could lead to a reduction in cash flows from operations 

contractual obligations at december 31 2020 include longterm debt note 9 interest on fixedrate longterm debt unconditional purchase obligations note 17 longterm advances from conrail note 6 operating leases note 10 agreements with consolidated rail corporation crc note 6 and unrecognized tax benefits note 4 



  

 this amount is shown in the other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of unrecognized obligations including unconditional purchase obligations and future interest payments on fixedrate longterm debt which are included in the table above in addition we entered into a synthetic lease during 2019 which is discussed further in note 10 

  

cash used in investing activities was 12 billion in 2020 compared with 18 billion in 2019 and 17 billion in 2018 the decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by lower property additions in 2019 increased coli activity and higher property additions were partially offset by increased proceeds from property sales we had the ability to borrow up to 750 million against our coli policies at december 31 2020 

capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the “railway property” section of part i of this report on form 10k for 2021 we expect capital spending will approximate 16 billion 

cash used in financing activities was 19 billion in 2020 compared with 20 billion in 2019 and 23 billion in 2018 the change in 2020 reflects lower repurchases of common stock and debt repayments partially offset by 

reduced proceeds from borrowings in 2019 the decrease was impacted by fewer repurchases of common stock higher debt repayments and increased dividends 

share repurchases of 14 billion in 2020 21 billion in 2019 and 28 billion in 2018 resulted in the retirement of 74 million 113 million and 171 million shares respectively as of december 31 2020 207 million shares 

k28 

remain authorized by our board of directors for repurchase the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash cash on hand or proceeds from borrowings 

in may 2020 we issued 800 million of 305 senior notes due 2050 resulting in 790 million in net proceeds 

in may 2020 we also issued 800 million of 3155 senior notes due 2055 in exchange for 554 million of previously issued notes 450 million at 51 due 2118 42 million at 6 due 2111 29 million at 79 due 2097 26 million at 6 due 2105 and 7 million at 705 due 2037 as part of the debt exchange a 4 million loss on extinguishment was recognized in “other income – net” 

in may 2020 we also renewed and amended our accounts receivable securitization program reducing our maximum borrowing capacity from 450 million to 400 million the term expires in may 2021 we had no amounts outstanding at december 31 2020 or december 31 2019 and our available borrowing capacity was 400 million and 429 million respectively 

in march 2020 we renewed and amended our fiveyear credit agreement we increased the program’s borrowing capacity from 750 million to 800 million the amended agreement expires in 2025 and provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants we had no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2020 or december 31 2019 

we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 9 and we have authority from our board of directors to issue an additional 16 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise our debttototal capitalization ratio was 462 at december 31 2020 compared with 445 at december 31 2019 

  

upcoming annual debt maturities are disclosed in note 9 overall our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note 12 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities 

  

for 2020 we assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 825 which was supported by our longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception as well as our expectation of future returns a onepercentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 24 million change in annual pension expense we review 

k29 

assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans a onepercentage point change to this discount rate assumption would result in a 17 million change in annual pension expense 

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our assets are longlived railway properties note 7 “properties” are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of assumptions and estimates 

expenditures including those on leased assets that extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials labor and other direct costs in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project a significant portion of our annual capital spending relates to selfconstructed assets costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that in our judgment do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed 

  

depreciation expense for 2020 totaled 12 billion our composite depreciation rates for 2020 are disclosed in note 7 a oneyear increase or decrease in the estimated average useful lives of depreciable assets would have resulted in an approximate 40 million decrease or increase to annual depreciation expense 

personal injury 

  

claims expense included in “materials and other” in the consolidated statements of income includes our estimate of costs for personal injuries 

  

to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study the accuracy of our estimate of the liability is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded 

see note 17 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates we use for personal injury 

income taxes 

  

our net deferred tax liability totaled 69 billion at december 31 2020 note 4 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we have a 57 million valuation allowance on 509 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2020 reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized 

k30 

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions pursuant to the railway labor act these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the railway labor act are completed we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements the current round of bargaining commenced on november 1 2019 with both management and the unions serving their formal proposals for changes to the collective bargaining agreements and direct negotiations are ongoing 

market risks 

  

at december 31 2020 we had no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a onepercentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2020 and amounts to an increase of approximately 20 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2020 we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 1 

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in longlived assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results levels of activity performance or our achievements or those of our industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forwardlooking statements in some cases forwardlooking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may” “will” “could” “would” “should” “expect” “plan” “anticipate” “intend” “believe” “estimate” “project” “consider” “predict” “potential” “feel” or other comparable terminology we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations assumptions estimates beliefs and projections while we believe these expectations assumptions estimates beliefs and projections are reasonable such forwardlooking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control these and other important factors including those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements herein are made only as of the date they were first issued and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the assistance of management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act at december 31 2020 based on such evaluation our officers have concluded that at december 31 2020 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time period specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data we recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

  

our board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies financial reporting and internal control the audit committee of our board of directors is comprised of outside directors who are independent of management the independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee 

  

we have issued a report of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2020 these reports appear in item 8 of this report on form 10k

the following table sets forth certain statistics relating to our railroads’ operations for the past five years 

  



railway operating revenues – total railway operating revenues were 113 billion in 2019 following is an overview of our three commodity groups see the discussion of merchandise revenues by major commodity group intermodal revenues and coal revenues and tonnage in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

k5

intermodal – our intermodal commodity group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers these shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies international steamship lines premium customers and asset owning companies intermodal units handled in 2019 were 42 million the revenues from which accounted for 25 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

coal – revenues from coal accounted for 15 of our total railway operating revenues in 2019 we handled 102 million tons or 09 million carloads in 2019 most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins with the balance from major western coal basins received via the memphis and chicago gateways our coal franchise supports the electric generation market serving approximately 60 coal generation plants as well as the export domestic metallurgical and industrial markets primarily through direct rail and river lake and coastal facilities including various terminals on the ohio river lamberts point in norfolk virginia the port of baltimore and lake erie 

freight rates – our predominant pricing mechanisms private contracts and exempt price quotes are not subject to regulation in general market forces are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

railway property 

  

our railroad infrastructure makes us capital intensive with net property of approximately 32 billion on a historical cost basis 

property additions – property additions for the past five years were as follows 



our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable rail transportation services 

k6 

equipment – at december 31 2019 we owned or leased the following units of equipment 

  



  

the following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at december 31 2019 

  



k7 

the following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at december 31 2019 and information regarding 2019 retirements 

  



track maintenance – of the approximately 35600 total miles of track on which we operate we are responsible for maintaining approximately 28400 miles with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance 

  

over 84 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard approximately 44 of our lines excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2019 

  

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding our track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 



traffic control – of the approximately 16400 route miles we dispatch about 11300 miles are signalized including 8500 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 2800 miles of automatic block signals of the 8500 miles of ctc approximately 7600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites 

  

environmental matters – compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is one of our principal goals to date such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or competitive position see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

employees – the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 



approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

k8 

government regulation – in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all business our railroads are subject to regulation by the us surface transportation board stb the stb has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb has jurisdiction to determine whether we are “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on the results of the prior year a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers 

  

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 included exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract approximately 90 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

efforts have been made over the past several years to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry and such efforts are expected to continue in 2020 the staggers rail act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

  

government regulations are further discussed within item 1a “risk factors” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition – there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprogress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

our primary rail competitor is csx corporation csx both ns and csx operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory we also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations – we continue to enhance the security of our rail system our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry to mitigate the risk of terrorist violent extremist or seriously disruptive cyberattack increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

our security plan also complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety 

k9 

and is integrated into hazardous material training programs additionally locationspecific security plans are in place for rail corridors in certain metropolitan areas referred to as high threat urban areas htua particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in a htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest 

we also operate six facilities that are under us coast guard uscg maritime security regulations with respect to these facilities each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and remains subject to inspection by the uscg 

additionally we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the transportation security administration the federal bureau of investigation the federal railroad administration fra the uscg us customs and border protection the department of defense and various state homeland security offices 

in 2019 through the norfolk southern operation awareness and response program as well as participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response program we provided rail accident response training to approximately 5700 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel our other training efforts throughout 2019 included participation in tabletop and full scale exercises for local state and federal agencies we also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the security and emergency response training course conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado 

we also continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning with test scenarios that include cybersecurity attacks our riskbased information security program helps ensure our defenses and resources are aligned to address the most likely and most damaging potential attacks to provide support for our organizational mission and operational objectives and to keep us in the best position to detect mitigate and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks in a timely fashion 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements the information set forth in this item 1a “risk factors” should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report including item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” and item 8 “ financial statements and supplementary data ” 

significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial operating and environmental matters could affect us our customers and the markets we serve congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to negotiate prices for rail services on railway operating revenues and on the efficiency of our operations this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot and the dhs which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety and security the rail safety improvement act of 2008 the surface transportation extension act of 2015 and the implementing regulations promulgated by the fra collectively “the ptc laws and regulations” require us and each other class i railroad to implement on certain mainline track where intercity and commuter passenger railroads operate and where tih hazardous materials are 

k10 

transported an interoperable positive train control system ptc ptc is a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent traintotrain collisions speedrelated derailments and certain other accidents caused by human error but ptc will not prevent all types of train accidents or incidents we met the deadline under the ptc laws and regulations to install all hardware and to implement ptc on some of those rail lines and we are required to fully implement ptc on the remainder of those rail lines by december 31 2020 in addition other railroads’ implementation schedules could impose additional interoperability requirements and accelerated timelines on us which could impact our operations over other railroads if not met 

full implementation of ptc will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures and ptc implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses and increased claims and litigation costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions past present and future is inherent in the railroad business this risk includes property owned by us whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time 

concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs decrease the amount of traffic handled and decrease the value of coal reserves we own 

in addition legislation and regulation related to ghgs could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers even without legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that 1 use commodities that we carry to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy 

as a common carrier by rail we must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property including environmental damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network the cost of a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

we may be affected by general economic conditions prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers 

significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and locomotives in addition workforce demographics and training requirements particularly for engineers and conductors could have a negative impact on our ability to meet shortterm demand for rail service unpredicted increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks 

k11 

we may be affected by energy prices volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including but not limited to the economy demand for transportation services business related to the energy sector including crude oil natural gas and coal fuel prices and fuel surcharges 

we face competition from other transportation providers we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and quality and reliability of service while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements expenditures legislation or regulation materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate such as granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers including shortlines and regional railroads with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies additionally any significant consolidations mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption a security breach or other operational difficulties we also face cybersecurity threats which may result in breaches of systems or compromises of sensitive data which may result in an inability to access or operate systems necessary for conducting operations and providing customer service thereby impacting our efficiency andor damaging our corporate reputation additionally if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service 

the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded 

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent not covered by insurance we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

k12 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues 

we may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets we consumed approximately 451 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2019 fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage 

to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capital intensive nature as well as the industryspecific requirements of the rail industry high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials 

the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of debt instruments as well as the sale of certain receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial position due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial position alone or in combination could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in 2007 various antitrust class actions filed against us and other class i railroads in various federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the district of columbia by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation in 2012 the court certified the case as a class action the defendant railroads appealed this certification and the court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for further consideration on october 10 2017 the district court denied class certification the decision was upheld by the court of appeals on august 16 2019 since that decision various individual cases have been filed in multiple jurisdictions we believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cases we do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 19500 route miles in 22 states and the district of columbia serves every major container port in the eastern united states and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers norfolk southern is a major transporter of industrial products including chemicals agriculture and metals and construction materials in addition we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a principal carrier of coal automobiles and automotive parts 

the execution of the initiatives in our strategic plan allowed us to achieve records for income from railway operations and railway operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses for the year we continued our focus on improving the efficiency of our operations and utilization of our assets allowing us to reduce our operating expenses by 3 in the face of a 1 revenue decline 

summarized results of operations 



income from railway operations rose in 2019 as a 3 reduction in railway operating expenses more than offset the impact of a 1 decline in railway operating revenues in addition to higher income from railway operations net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2019 also benefited from a lower effective tax rate our continuing share repurchase program contributed to diluted earnings per share growth that exceeded that of net income 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” was signed into law the following table adjusts our 2017 us generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial results to exclude the effects of tax reform specifically the effects of remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35 to 21 the “2017 tax adjustments” we use these nongaap financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the 2017 tax adjustments while we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies 

k18 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 



in the table below and the paragraph following references to 2017 results and related comparisons use the adjusted nongaap results from the reconciliation in the table above 



income from railway operations increased in 2018 as compared to 2017 as a 9 increase in railway operating revenues more than offset a 4 increase in adjusted operating expenses in addition to higher income from railway operations net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2018 also benefited from a lower effective tax rate primarily due to the enactment of tax reform finally our share repurchase program resulted in diluted earnings per share growth that exceeded that of net income

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

the following tables present a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes units and average revenue per unit by major commodity group at the beginning of 2019 we made changes in the categorization of certain commodity groups within merchandise prior period railway operating revenues units and revenue per unit have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation see note 2 







k20 

revenues decreased 162 million in 2019 but increased 907 million in 2018 compared to the prior years as reflected in the table below lower 2019 revenues were the result of decreased volumes partially offset by higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains the rise in 2018 revenues was the result of higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by the mixrelated impacts of increased intermodal volume and decreased coal volume in addition overall volume also increased 

the table below reflects the components of the revenue change by major commodity group 



  

approximately 90 of our revenue base is covered by contracts that include negotiated fuel surcharges these revenues totaled 578 million 657 million and 359 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

for 2020 merchandise and intermodal revenues are expected to increase while coal revenues are anticipated to decline resulting in overall revenues that are expected to be flat 

merchandise revenues increased in both 2019 and 2018 compared with the prior years in 2019 revenues grew due to higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains which were partially offset by volume declines in all commodity groups in 2018 revenues grew due to higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue as well as higher volumes volume gains in chemicals and agriculture products were partially offset by declines in automotive traffic 

chemicals revenues rose in both 2019 and 2018 compared with the prior years in 2019 the rise was the result of higher average revenue per unit due to pricing gains which were partially offset by volume declines volume declines in natural gas petroleum products organic and inorganic chemicals and plastics were partially offset by gains in crude oil and municipal waste in 2018 the rise was the result of higher volume and higher average revenue per unit due to pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue volumes grew due to increased shipments of crude oil liquefied petroleum gas plastics and municipal waste shipments partially offset by a decrease in coal ash shipments 

  

agriculture products revenues rose in both 2019 and 2018 compared to the prior years growth in 2019 was due to higher average revenue per unit a result of pricing gains which more than offset volume declines volumes were down due to decreased shipments of ethanol soybeans and fertilizer partially offset by increases in corn shipments growth in 2018 was due to higher average revenue per unit a result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues and higher volume higher ethanol and fertilizer shipments more than offset declines in soybean and corn shipments 

metals and construction revenues declined in 2019 but increased in 2018 compared to the prior years in 2019 volume declines were largely offset by higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains volume declines in iron and steel coil sand and scrap metal were partially offset by increases in aggregates shipments due to improved service and market strength in 2018 higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains and 

k21 

higher fuel surcharge revenue drove the increase while volumes remained flat volume increases in frac sand shipments for use in natural gas drilling in the marcellus and utica regions were offset by declines in aggregates cement aluminum and iron and steel 

automotive revenues were flat in 2019 and increased in 2018 compared to the prior years in 2019 higher average revenue per unit driven by price increases offset volume declines that were primarily the result of decreases in us light vehicle production and the united automobile workers strike in the fourth quarter in 2018 higher average revenue per unit driven by price increases and higher fuel surcharge revenues more than offset volume declines traffic declines were the result of shortages of availability of multilevel equipment and scheduled automotive plant downtime 

forest and consumer revenues were flat in 2019 and increased in 2018 compared to the prior years in 2019 higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains offset volume declines volume declines were primarily driven by reduced shipments of pulpboard lumber and wood and kaolin in 2018 higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue drove the increase while volumes remained flat gains in pulpboard a result of tightened truck capacity were offset by decreases in pulp woodchip and graphic paper 

intermodal revenues decreased in 2019 but increased considerably in 2018 compared to the prior years the decline in 2019 was driven by lower volumes which were partially offset by higher average revenue per unit a result of pricing gains the rise in 2018 was driven by higher average revenue per unit a result of increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains and higher volume 

intermodal units by market were as follows 



domestic volume fell in 2019 but increased in 2018 volume was challenged in 2019 by stronger overtheroad competition the rise in 2018 benefited from continued highway conversions due to tighter capacity in the truck market higher truckload pricing and growth from existing accounts 

international volume increased in both periods reflecting increased demand from new and existing customers despite 2019 volume being somewhat tempered by tariff concerns 

  

coal revenues decreased in 2019 but increased in 2018 compared with the prior years the decrease in 2019 was a result of lower volume which was partially offset by higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains revenue growth in 2018 was the result of higher average revenue per unit largely the result of pricing gains which more than offset volume declines 

k22 

as shown in the following table total tonnage decreased in both periods 



utility coal tonnage declined in both periods from continued headwinds from low natural gas prices as well as additional natural gas and renewable energy generating capacity that were slightly offset by our service improvements and customer inventory rebuilding 

export coal tonnage decreased in 2019 but increased in 2018 the decline in 2019 was a result of weak thermal seaborne pricing and coal supply disruptions at certain mines the increase in 2018 was due to strong seaborne pricing that resulted in higher demand for us coal 

  

domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was down in both years the decline in 2019 was a reflection of challenging overall market conditions including softening domestic steel demand customer sourcing changes and plant outages the decline in 2018 was a reflection of customer sourcing changes 

industrial coal tonnage decreased in both years driven by customer sourcing changes and pressure from natural gas conversions 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications were as follows 



in 2019 expenses fell as our strategic initiatives to improve productivity resulted in lower compensation equipment rents and materials expense these decreases along with lower fuel prices and consumption were partially offset by lower gains on property sales increased depreciation and a writeoff of a 32 million receivable as a result of a legal dispute in 2018 expenses rose due to higher fuel prices as well as volumerelated increases and costs associated with overall lower network velocity partially offset by higher gains on property sales 

k23 

compensation and benefits decreased in 2019 reflecting changes in 

• employment levels down 117 million 

• incentive and stockbased compensation down 83 million 

• overtime and recrews down 45 million 

• higher capitalized labor 9 million 

• 2018 employment tax refund 31 million unfavorable in 2019 

• pay rates up 76 million and 

• other down 27 million 

in 2018 compensation and benefits decreased a result of changes in 

• employment levels down 61 million 

• health and welfare benefit rates for agreement employees down 34 million 

• employment tax refund 31 million benefit 

• incentive and stockbased compensation down 7 million 

• pay rates up 34 million 

• overtime and recrews up 58 million and 

• other down 13 million 

our employment averaged 24587 in 2019 compared with 26662 in 2018 and 27110 in 2017 

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals in 2017 this line item includes a 151 million benefit from the 2017 tax adjustments 36 million in purchased services and 115 million in equipment rents in the form of higher income of certain equity investees 



the increase in purchased services in 2019 was the result of increased technologyrelated expenses expenses associated with our headquarters relocation and increased intermodalrelated costs partially offset by decreased transportation activities the increase in purchased services in 2018 was largely the result of the absence of the benefit from the 2017 tax adjustments higher intermodal volumerelated costs additional transportation and engineering activities as well as higher technology costs 

equipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment decreased in 2019 but increased in 2018 in 2019 the decrease was largely due to improved network velocity and the absence of shortterm locomotive resource costs incurred in the prior year in 2018 the rise was due to the absence of the benefits from the 2017 tax adjustments the impact of slower network velocity the cost of additional shortterm locomotive resources as well as growth in volume 

fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations decreased in 2019 but increased in 2018 the change in both years was principally due to locomotive fuel prices down 8 in 2019 and up 25 in 2018 which decreased expenses 82 million in 2019 but increased expenses 208 million in 2018 locomotive fuel consumption decreased 4 in 2019 but increased 3 in 2018 we consumed 

k24 

approximately 451 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2019 compared with 472 million gallons in 2018 and 458 million gallons in 2017 

depreciation expense increased in both periods a reflection of growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock and technology 

materials and other expenses increased in 2019 but decreased in 2018 as shown in the following table 



  

materials expense decreased in 2019 due primarily to lower locomotive repair costs as a result of fewer locomotives in service in 2018 the increase was primarily a result of higher locomotive repair costs 

casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters the 2019 expense increased primarily the result of higher costs related to environmental remediation matters and higher personal injury costs the 2018 expense increased primarily the result of higher derailmentrelated costs 

other expense increased in 2019 but decreased in 2018 largely a result of gains from sales of operating properties gains from operating property sales amounted to 64 million 158 million and 79 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in 2019 the increase was additionally impacted by the writeoff of a 32 million receivable as a result of a legal dispute in 2018 the decline was also impacted by the inclusion of net rental income from operating property previously included in “other income – net” of 78 million partially offset by increased costs as a result of the relocation of our train dispatchers to atlanta georgia 

other income – net 

other income – net increased in 2019 but decreased in 2018 the increase in 2019 was driven by higher returns on corporateowned life insurance coli investments and increased gains on sales of nonoperating property which more than offset a 49 million impairment loss related to our natural resource assets that we are actively marketing to sell the decline in 2018 was driven by the absence of net rental income as discussed above and unfavorable returns from coli investments 

income taxes 

  

the effective income tax rate was 220 in 2019 compared with 231 in 2018 and negative 728 in 2017 both 2019 and 2018 benefited from favorable reductions in deferred taxes for state tax law changes and certain business tax credits while 2019 and 2017 benefited from higher returns from coli income taxes in 2018 benefited from the effects of the enactment of tax reform in late 2017 that lowered the federal corporate income tax rate income taxes in 2017 included a benefit of 3331 million related to the effects of the enactment of tax reform from the reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities driven by the change in the federal rate all three years benefited from favorable tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation 

k25 

for 2020 we expect the effective income tax rate to range from 23 to 24 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities our principal source of liquidity was 39 billion in 2019 37 billion in 2018 and 33 billion in 2017 the increases in both 2019 and 2018 were primarily the result of improved operating results we had working capital deficits of 219 million and 729 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively cash cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 580 million and 446 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations 

contractual obligations at december 31 2019 include interest on fixedrate longterm debt longterm debt note 9 unconditional purchase obligations note 17 operating leases note 10 longterm advances from conrail and agreements with consolidated rail corporation crc note 6 and unrecognized tax benefits note 4 



  

 this amount is shown in the other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of unrecognized obligations including unconditional purchase obligations and future interest payments on fixedrate longterm debt which are included in the table above in addition we entered into a synthetic lease during 2019 which is discussed further in note 10 

  

cash used in investing activities was 18 billion in 2019 compared with 17 billion in 2018 and 15 billion in 2017 in 2019 increased corporate owned life insurance activity and higher property additions were partially offset by increased proceeds from property sales in 2018 higher property additions drove the increase 

capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the “railway property” section of part i of this report on form 10k for 2020 we expect capital spending to approximate 16 to 18 of revenues 

cash used in financing activities was 20 billion in 2019 compared with 23 billion in 2018 and 20 billion in 2017 both yearoveryear comparisons reflect higher debt repayments and increased dividends in 2019 the decrease was also impacted by fewer repurchases of common stock in 2018 the increase was also impacted by increased repurchases of common stock but tempered by increased proceeds from borrowings 

share repurchases totaled 21 billion in 2019 28 billion in 2018 and 10 billion in 2017 for the purchase and retirement of 113 million 171 million including 70 million shares repurchased for 12 billion under the accelerated share repurchase asr program and 82 million shares respectively as of december 31 2019 280 million shares remain authorized by our board of directors for repurchase the timing and volume of future 

k26 

share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash cash on hand or proceeds from borrowings 

in may 2019 we issued 200 million of 380 senior notes due 2028 400 million of 410 senior notes due 2049 and 200 million of 510 senior notes due 2118 in november 2019 we issued 400 million of 255 senior notes due 2029 and 400 million of 340 senior notes due 2049 

in may 2019 we also renewed and amended our accounts receivable securitization program increasing our maximum borrowing capacity from 400 million to 450 million with a term expiring in may 2020 we had no amounts outstanding at both december 31 2019 and 2018 

we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 9 and we have authority from our board of directors to issue an additional 16 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise our debttototal capitalization ratio was 445 at december 31 2019 compared with 420 at december 31 2018 

  

upcoming annual debt maturities are disclosed in note 9 overall our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note 12 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities 

  

in recording our net pension benefit we assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 825 which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception as well as our expectation of future returns a onepercentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 23 million change in pension expense we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans a onepercentage point change to this discount rate assumption would result in about an 18 million change in pension expense 

k27 

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our assets are longlived railway properties note 7 “properties” are stated principally at cost and are depreciated using the group method whereby assets with similar characteristics use and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and depreciated using a composite depreciation rate see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area 

expenditures including those on leased assets that extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are capitalized expenditures capitalized include those that are directly related to a capital project and may include materials labor and other direct costs in addition to an allocable portion of indirect costs that relate to a capital project a significant portion of our annual capital spending relates to the replacement of selfcontructed assets costs related to repairs and maintenance activities that in our judgment do not extend an asset’s useful life or increase its utility are expensed when such repairs are performed 

  

depreciation expense for 2019 totaled 11 billion our composite depreciation rates for 2019 are disclosed in 

note 7 a one year increase or decrease in the estimated average useful lives of depreciable assets would have resulted in an approximate 40 million decrease or increase to depreciation expense 

personal injury 

  

casualties and other claims expense included in “materials and other” in the consolidated statements of income includes our accrual for personal injury liabilities 

  

to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded 

for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury see note 17 

income taxes 

  

our net deferred tax liability totaled 68 billion at december 31 2019 note 4 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we have a 54 million valuation allowance on 513 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2019 reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized 

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions pursuant to the railway labor act these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the railway labor act are completed we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements 

k28 

the next round of bargaining commenced on november 1 2019 with both management and the unions serving their formal proposals for changes to the collective bargaining agreements 

market risks 

  

at december 31 2019 we had no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2019 and amounts to an increase of approximately 21 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2019 we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 1 

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in longlived assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

forwardlooking statements 

  

certain statements in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 as amended these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results levels of activity performance or our achievements or those of our industry to be materially different from those expressed or implied by any forwardlooking statements in some cases forwardlooking statements can be identified by terminology such as “may” “will” “could” “would” “should” “expect” “plan” “anticipate” “intend” “believe” “estimate” “project” “consider” “predict” “potential” “feel” or other comparable terminology we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations assumptions estimates beliefs and projections while we believe these expectations assumptions estimates beliefs and projections are reasonable such forwardlooking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control these and other important factors including those discussed in item 1a “risk factors” may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements herein are made only as of the date they were first issued and unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data we recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

  

our board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies financial reporting and internal control the audit committee of our board of directors is comprised of outside directors who are independent of management the independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee 

  

we have issued a report of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2019 these reports appear in item 8 of this report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

k  3 

railroad operations   –   at   december 31 2018  our railroad operated approximately 19500  route miles in   22   states and the district of columbia 

  

our   system reaches   many manufacturing plants electric generating facilities mines distribution centers transload facilities and other businesses located   in   our   service area 

corridors with heaviest freight volume 

 

k  4 

the miles operated which include major leased lines between cincinnati ohio and chattanooga tennessee and an exclusive operating agreement for   trackage rights over property owned by north carolina railroad company were as follows 

  



  

we operate freight service over lines with significant ongoing amtrak and commuter passenger operations and conduct freight operations over trackage owned or leased by amtrak new jersey transit southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority metronorth commuter railroad company maryland department of transportation and michigan department of transportation 

the following table sets forth certain statistics relating to   our   railroads’ operations for the past five years 

  



 

railway operating revenues   –   total railway operating revenues were 115 billion  in 2018  following is an overview of our three major commodity groups see the discussion of merchandise revenues by commodity group intermodal revenues and coal revenues and tonnage in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

k  5 

merchandise   –  our merchandise commodity group is composed of five groupings 

 

merchandise carloads handled in 2018  were 25 million  the revenues from which accounted for 59 of our total railway operating revenues 

intermodal   –  our intermodal commodity group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers these shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies international steamship lines truckers and other shippers intermodal units handled in 2018  were 44 million the revenues from which accounted for 25 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

coal   – revenues from coal accounted for 16 of our total railway operating revenues in 2018  we handled 115 million  tons or 10 million  carloads in 2018  most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins with the balance from major western coal basins received via the memphis and chicago gateways our coal franchise supports the electric generation market serving approximately 70 coal generation plants as well as the export domestic metallurgical and industrial markets   primarily through direct rail and river lake and coastal facilities including various terminals on the ohio river   lamberts point in norfolk virginia   the port of baltimore and lake erie 

freight rates   –  our predominant pricing mechanisms private contracts and exempt price quotes are not subject to regulation in general market forces   are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

railway property 

  

our railroad infrastructure makes   us   capital intensive with net property of approximately  31 billion  on a historical cost basis 

property additions   –   property additions for the past five years were as follows 



our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable rail transportation services 

k  6 

equipment   –   at   december 31 2018  we   owned or leased the following units of equipment 

  



  

the following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at december 31 2018  

  



k  7 

the following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at december 31 2018  and   information regarding 2018  retirements 

  



track maintenance   –  of the approximately 35600 total miles of track on which we operate we are responsible for maintaining approximately 28400 miles with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance 

  

over 83 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard approximately 47 of our lines excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2018  

  

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding   our   track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 



traffic control   –  of the approximately 16400 route miles we dispatch about 11300 miles are signalized including 8500 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 2800 miles of automatic block signals of the 8500 miles of ctc approximately 7600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites 

  

environmental matters   –   compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is   one of our   principal goals to date such compliance   has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or competitive position see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

employees   –   the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 



approximately 80   of our   railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

k  8 

government regulation   –   in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all business our   railroads are subject to regulation by the us surface transportation board stb the stb has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb has jurisdiction to determine whether we are “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on the results of the prior year a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers 

  

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 included exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract approximately 90 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

efforts   have been made over the past several years   to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry   and such efforts are expected to continue in 2019  the staggers rail act of 1980   substantially balanced   the interests of shippers and rail carriers   and   encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly   we   will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

  

government regulations are discussed within item 1a “risk factors” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition   –   there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprogress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

our   primary rail competitor is csx   corporation csx both ns and csx operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory we   also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable   railroads   to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations –  we continue to enhance the security of our rail system our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

our plan also complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness 

k  9 

training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and is integrated into hazardous material training programs additionally locationspecific security plans are in place for certain metropolitan areas and each of the six facilities we operate that are under us coast guard uscg maritime security regulations with respect to these facilities each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and remains subject to inspection by the uscg 

  

additionally we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the transportation security administration the federal bureau of investigation the federal railroad administration fra the uscg us customs and border protection the department of defense and various state homeland security offices similarly we follow guidance from dhs and dot regarding rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 substantially reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest 

in 2018 through participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response program we provided rail accident response training to approximately 6300 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel our other training efforts throughout 2018 included participation in drills for local state and federal agencies we also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the security and emergency response training course conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado 

we also continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning with test scenarios that include cybersecurity attacks our riskbased information security program helps ensure our defenses and resources are aligned to address the most likely and most damaging potential attacks to provide support for our organizational mission and operational objectives and to keep us in the best position to detect mitigate and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks in a timely fashion 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements the information set forth in this item 1a “risk factors” should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report including item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ”  and item 8 “ financial statements and supplementary data ” 

  

significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial operating and environmental matters could affect us our customers and the markets we serve congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry   railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has   jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail   lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common   carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or   existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to negotiate prices for rail services on railway operating revenues and on the   efficiency of our operations this potential material adverse effect   could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot and the dhs which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety and security the rail safety improvement act of 2008 the surface transportation extension act of 2015 and the implementing regulations promulgated by the fra collectively “the ptc laws and regulations” require us and each other class i railroad to implement on certain mainline track where intercity and commuter passenger railroads operate and where tih hazardous materials are 

k  10 

transported an interoperable positive train control system ptc ptc is a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent traintotrain collisions speedrelated derailments and certain other accidents caused by human error but ptc will not prevent all types of train accidents or incidents we have met the december 31 2018 deadline under the ptc laws and regulations to install all hardware and to implement ptc on some of those rail lines the ptc laws and regulations also require us to fully implement ptc on the remainder of those rail lines by december 31 2020 in addition other railroads’ implementation schedules could impose additional interoperability requirements and accelerated timelines on us which could impact our operations over other railroads if not met 

full implementation of ptc will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures and ptc implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses and increased claims and litigation costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions past present and future is inherent in the railroad business this risk includes property owned by us whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time 

concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs decrease the amount of traffic handled and decrease the value of coal reserves we own 

in addition legislation and regulation related to ghgs could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers even without legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that 1 use commodities that we carry to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy 

as a common carrier by rail we must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and   property including environmental damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network the cost of a catastrophic rail   accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage we have obtained insurance for potential losses for   thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements   however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if   available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

we may be affected by general economic conditions prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers 

significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and locomotives   in addition workforce demographics and training   requirements particularly for engineers and conductors could have a   negative impact on our ability to meet shortterm demand for rail service unpredicted increases in demand for rail services   may exacerbate such risks 

k  11 

we may be affected by energy prices volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including but not limited to the economy demand for transportation services business related to the energy sector including crude oil natural gas and coal fuel prices and fuel surcharges 

we face competition from other transportation providers we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and quality and reliability of service while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements expenditures legislation or regulation materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate such as granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers including shortlines and regional railroads with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies additionally any significant consolidations mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption a security breach or other operational difficulties we also face cybersecurity threats which may result in breaches of systems or compromises of sensitive data which may result in an inability to access or operate systems necessary for conducting operations and providing customer service thereby impacting our efficiency andor damaging our corporate reputation additionally if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service 

the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective   bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage   or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations additionally future national   labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly   increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded 

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent not covered by insurance we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and first 

k  12 

party property damages however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues 

we may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets we consumed approximately 472 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2018 fuel   availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or   rationing regulations a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in   existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage 

to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capital intensive nature as well as the industryspecific requirements of the rail industry high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials 

the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of debt instruments as well as the sale of certain receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial position due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial position alone or in combination could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 19500 route miles in 22 states and the district of columbia serves every major container port in the eastern united states and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers norfolk southern is a major transporter of industrial products including chemicals agriculture and metals and construction materials in addition the railroad operates the most extensive intermodal network in the east and is a principal carrier of coal automobiles and automotive parts 

we achieved records for income from railway operations and railway operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses for the year the result of significant revenue growth partially offset by increased operating expenses progress on our strategic initiatives established in 2015 has created a sustainable platform positioning us for the continued execution of transformational changes that will provide greater longterm value for our shareholders 

summarized results of operations 



on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” was signed into law as a result of the enactment of this law in 2017 “purchased services and rents” included a 151 million benefit and “income taxes” included a 3331 million benefit which added 3482 million to “net income” and 1200 to “diluted earnings per share” the 2017 operating ratio was favorably impacted by 15 percentage points for more information on the impact of tax reform see note 4 

the following table adjusts our 2017 gaap financial results to exclude the effects of tax reform specifically the effects of remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35 to 21 the “2017 tax adjustments” we use these nongaap financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the 2017 tax adjustments while we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies 

k  18 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 



in the table below and the paragraph following references to 2017 results and related comparisons use the adjusted nongaap results from the reconciliation in the table above 



income from railway operations rose in both comparisons resulting from higher railway operating revenues that more than offset higher expenses revenue growth of 9 and 7 in 2018 and 2017 respectively was tempered by increased adjusted operating expenses of 4 in both periods in addition to higher income from railway operations net income and diluted earnings per share growth in 2018 also benefited from a lower effective tax rate primarily due to the enactment of tax reform finally our share repurchase programs in both years resulted in diluted earnings per share growth that exceeded that of net income

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

the following tables present a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes units and average revenue per unit by commodity group

revenues increased 907 million and 663 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively compared to the prior years as reflected in the table below higher 2018 revenues were the result of higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by the mixrelated impacts of increased intermodal volume and decreased coal volume in addition overall volume also increased the rise in 2017 was largely the result of increased volume particularly in our coal and intermodal markets coupled with pricing gains the table below reflects the components of the revenue change by major commodity group 



  

most of our contracts include negotiated fuel surcharges typically tied to either onhighway diesel ohd or west texas intermediate crude oil approximately 90 of our revenue base is covered by these negotiated fuel surcharges with almost 75 tied to ohd for both 2018 and 2017 contracts tied to ohd accounted for about 90 of our fuel surcharge revenue revenues associated with fuel surcharges totaled 657 million 359 million and 236 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

merchandise  revenues increased in both 2018 and 2017 compared with the prior years in 2018 revenues grew due to higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue as well as higher volumes volume gains in chemicals agriculture and paper clay and forest products were partially offset by declines in automotive and metals and construction traffic revenue growth in 2017 was a result of higher average revenue per unit the result of price improvements volume was relatively flat compared to the prior year as gains in the metals and construction group were offset by declines in automotive agriculture and chemicals traffic 

for 2019  merchandise revenues are expected to increase primarily the result of pricing gains 

chemicals revenues rose in 2018 compared to a modest increase in 2017 in 2018 the rise was the result of higher volume and higher average revenue per unit due to pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue volumes grew due to increased shipments of crude oil liquefied petroleum gas and plastics partially offset by a decrease in coal ash shipments the increase in 2017 was due to higher average revenue per unit a result of favorable mix and price improvements which outweighed declines in volume volume declines were the result of fewer shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields lower shipments of coal ash partially offset by an increase in shipments of plastics 

  

for 2019  chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher the effect of overall pricing gains we expect carloads to be relatively flat yearoveryear as declines in liquefied petroleum gas are expected to be offset by gains in crude oil 

agriculture consumer products and government revenues   increased in 2018 and were flat in 2017 compared to the prior years growth in 2018 was due to higher volume and higher average revenue per unit a result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues higher ethanol and fertilizer shipments more than offset declines in soybean and corn shipments in 2017 lower traffic volume was offset by higher revenue per unit driven by pricing gains volume declines in ethanol and soybeans reflecting reduced market demand more than offset increases in fertilizer 

k  21 

for 2019  agriculture consumer products and government revenues are expected to increase driven by increased average revenue per unit primarily a result of pricing gains we expect volumes to decrease due to lower fertilizer shipments 

metals and construction revenues grew in both periods more significantly so in 2017 in 2018 higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue more than offset volume declines volume declines in aggregates cement aluminum and iron and steel were partially offset by increases in frac sand shipments for use in natural gas drilling in the marcellus and utica regions in 2017 higher volume and average revenue per unit contributed to the rise in revenues volume growth was a result of more frac sand shipments for use in natural gas drilling in the marcellus and utica regions and more iron and steel shipments driven by continued improvement in construction activity these increases were partially offset by a decline in coil steel traffic due to customer sourcing changes revenue per unit growth in 2017 was driven by favorable changes in traffic mix 

  

for 2019 metals and construction revenues are expected to rise a result of increased revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and volume growth is expected in aggregates and coil steel traffic 

automotive revenues rose in 2018 but declined in 2017 compared to the prior years in 2018 higher average revenue per unit driven by price increases and higher fuel surcharge revenues more than offset volume declines traffic declines were the result of shortages of availability of multilevel equipment and scheduled automotive plant downtime the drop in volume in 2017 was driven mainly by decreases in us light vehicle production as well as temporary shutdowns for retooling of several nsserved facilities average revenue per unit increased for the year primarily the result of higher fuel surcharge revenue 

  

for 2019  automotive revenues are expected to increase as a result of higher volumes reflecting increased demand at nsserved plants and higher average revenue per unit driven by price increases 

paper clay and forest products revenues rose in both 2018 and 2017 compared to the prior years in 2018 higher average revenue per unit the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue and volume gains drove the increase gains in pulpboard and municipal waste shipments a result of tightened truck capacity and growth with existing customers respectively were partially offset by decreases in pulp woodchip and graphic paper traffic the increase in 2017 was due to higher average revenue per unit a result of pricing gains and changes in the traffic mix traffic was flat for the year as increases in waste and pulp shipments were offset by losses in woodchip volume due to customer sourcing changes 

for 2019  paper clay and forest products revenues are anticipated to increase reflecting pricing gains we expect volume to decline slightly as gains in lumber traffic are expected to be offset by declines in wood chips and graphic paper 

intermodal  revenues increased considerably in both 2018 and 2017 compared to the prior years the rise in 2018 was driven by higher average revenue per unit a result of increased fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains and higher volume growth in 2017 was the result of higher volume and higher average revenue per unit due to higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains 

for 2019 we expect intermodal revenues to rise the result of increased domestic volumes and higher average revenue per unit driven by rate increases 

k  22 

intermodal units by market were as follows 



domestic  volume increased in both periods the rise in 2018 benefited from continued highway conversions due to tighter capacity in the truck market higher truckload pricing and growth from existing accounts in 2017 continued highway conversions and growth from existing accounts drove the increase 

for 2019 we expect higher domestic volumes driven by continued highway conversions and growth from existing accounts 

international  volume increased in both years reflecting increased demand from existing customers 

  

for 2019 we expect continued growth in our international volume largely driven by more traffic from existing customers 

coal  revenues increased in 2018 and significantly so in 2017 compared with the prior years revenue growth in 2018 was the result of higher average revenue per unit largely the result of pricing gains which more than offset volume declines the increase in 2017 was a result of higher volume primarily in the export market and higher revenue per unit driven by higher fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains 

for 2019  coal revenues are expected to remain relatively flat yearoveryear higher export and domestic metallurgical volumes are expected to be offset by lower revenue per unit primarily the result of lower pricing in our export market 

as shown in the following table total tonnage decreased slightly in 2018 but increased in 2017 



utility coal  tonnage declined in 2018 driven by lower network velocity decreased coal supply inclement weather in the first quarter and plant outages tonnage rose in 2017 driven by market share gains partially offset by limited coal burn due to milder weather both periods were negatively impacted by sustained lower natural gas prices 

k  23 

for 2019  we expect utility tonnage to be relatively flat yearoveryear the result of continued pressure from natural gas prices and continued expected growth in renewable and natural gas capacity 

export coal  tonnage increased in both periods due to strong seaborne pricing that resulted in higher demand for us coal volume through norfolk was up 23 million  tons or 15  in 2018 and 55 million tons or 57 in 2017 volume through baltimore declined 08 million tons or 7 in 2018 but rose 64 million tons or 129 in 2017 

  

for 2019  we expect export coal tonnage to rise due to continued demand for us coal 

  

domestic metallurgical coal  tonnage was down slightly in 2018 but up in 2017 the decline in 2018 was a reflection of customer sourcing changes in 2017 the increase was a result of market share gains 

for 2019  domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to grow due to increased demand in domestic steel production 

industrial coal  tonnage decreased in both years in 2018 the decrease reflected customer sourcing changes and pressure from natural gas conversions the drop in 2017 was a result of plant outages natural gas conversions and decreased coal burn 

  

for 2019  industrial coal tonnage is expected to decrease as a result of continued pressure from natural gas conversions and customer sourcing changes 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications were as follows 



in 2018  expenses rose due to higher fuel prices as well as volumerelated increases and costs associated with overall lower network velocity partially offset by higher property sales in 2017 we experienced an overall increase in expense compared to the prior year reflecting higher fuel expense incentive compensation inflationary increases and volumerelated costs partially offset by improved productivity and increased equity in earnings of certain investees as a result of the enactment of tax reform 

k  24 

compensation and benefits decreased in 2018 reflecting changes in 

 

in 2017  compensation and benefits increased a result of changes in 

 

our employment averaged 26662 in 2018  compared with 27110 in 2017  and 28044 in 2016  

purchased services and rents  includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals as previously discussed in 2017 this line item includes a 151 million benefit from the 2017 tax adjustments 36 million in purchased services and 115 million in equipment rents in the form of higher income of certain equity investees 



the increase in purchased services in 2018 was largely the result of the absence of the benefit from the 2017 tax adjustments higher intermodal volumerelated costs additional transportation and engineering activities as well as higher technology costs in addition to the tax reform impacts discussed above the remaining increase in purchased services expense in 2017 was a result of higher intermodal volumerelated costs 

equipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment increased in 2018 but decreased in 2017 in 2018 the rise was due to the absence of the benefits from the 2017 tax adjustments the impact of slower network velocity the cost of additional shortterm locomotive resources as well as growth in volume in 2017 in addition to the benefit from the 2017 tax adjustments the decline was a result of lower automotive volume 

fuel  expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations increased in both periods the change in both years was principally due to locomotive fuel prices up 25 in 2018 and up 22 in 2017 which increased expenses 208 million and 143 million respectively locomotive fuel consumption increased 3 in 2018 but declined 1 in 2017 we consumed approximately 472 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2018 compared with 458 million gallons in 2017 and 462 million gallons in 2016 

depreciation  expense increased in both periods a reflection of growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock 

k  25 

materials and other  expenses decreased in both periods as shown in the following table 



  

materials expense increased in 2018 due primarily to higher locomotive repair costs in 2017 the decline was a result of lower freight car repairs 

casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters the 2018 expense increased primarily the result of higher derailmentrelated costs the decrease in 2017 was the result of lower loss and damage offset in part by unfavorable developments in personal injury cases 

other expense decreased in both periods largely a result of higher gains from sales of operating properties up 79 million and 42 million in 2018 and 2017 respectively compared to the prior periods in 2018 the decline was additionally impacted by the inclusion of net rental income from operating property previously included in “other income – net” of 78 million partially offset by increased costs as a result of the relocation of our train dispatchers to atlanta georgia 

other income – net 

other income – net decreased in 2018 following an increase in 2017 the decline was driven by the absence of net rental income as discussed above and unfavorable returns from corporateowned life insurance coli investments in 2017 the rise was mainly the result of favorable returns on coli investments 

income taxes 

  

the effective income tax rate was 231 in 2018 compared with negative 728 in 2017 and 354 in 2016 income taxes in 2018 benefited from the effects of the enactment of tax reform in late 2017 that lowered the federal corporate income tax rate income taxes in 2017 included a benefit of 3331 million related to the effects of the enactment of tax reform from the reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities driven by the change in the federal rate all three years benefited from favorable tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation both 2018 and 2016 benefited from favorable reductions in deferred taxes for state tax law changes and certain business tax credits while 2017 and 2016 benefited from higher returns from corporateowned life insurance 

the statute of limitations on internal revenue service irs examinations has expired for all years prior to 2015 our consolidated federal income tax return for 2015 is currently being audited by the irs we do not expect that the resolution of the examination will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities  our principal source of liquidity was 37 billion  in 2018   33 billion  in 2017  and 30 billion in   2016  the increases in both 2018 and 2017 were primarily the result of improved 

k  26 

operating results we had working capital deficits of 729 million and 396 million at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively cash cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled 446 million and 690 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations 

contractual obligations  at december 31 2018  were comprised of interest on fixedrate longterm debt longterm debt note 9 unconditional purchase obligations note 17 operating leases note 10 longterm advances from conrail agreements with consolidated rail corporation crc note 6 and unrecognized tax benefits note 4 



  

 this amount is shown in the other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

off balance sheet arrangements  consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 10 

  

cash used in investing activities  was 17 billion  in 2018  compared with 15 billion  in 2017  and 18 billion  in 2016  in 2018 higher property additions drove the increase the decline in 2017 was a reflection of lower cash outflows for property additions and a drop in corporateowned life insurance investments 

capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the “railway property” section of part i of this report on form 10k for 2019 we expect capital spending to approximate 16 to 18 of revenues 

cash used in financing activities  was 23 billion  in 2018  compared with 20 billion  in 2017  and 13 billion  in 2016  both yearoveryear comparisons reflect increased repurchases of common stock and higher debt repayments in 2018 the increase was also impacted by higher dividend payments but tempered by increased proceeds from borrowings in 2017 lower proceeds from borrowings also contributed to the rise 

share repurchases totaled 28 billion  in 2018  10 billion  in 2017  and 803 million  in 2016  for the purchase and retirement of 171 million including 70 million shares repurchased for 12 billion under the asr program see note 15 82 million  and 92 million  shares respectively as of december 31 2018 394 million shares remain authorized by our board of directors for repurchase the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash cash on hand or proceeds from borrowings 

in february of 2018 we issued 500 million of 415 senior notes due 2048 in august of 2018 we issued 300 million of 365 senior notes due 2025 400 million of 380 senior notes due 2028 200 million of 415 senior notes due 2048 and 600 million of 510 senior notes due 2118 see note 9 

  

k  27 

we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 9 and we have authority from our board of directors to issue an additional 12 billion  of debt or equity securities through public or private sale all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise our debttototal capitalization ratio was 420 at december 31 2018  compared with 375 at december 31 2017  

  

upcoming annual debt maturities are disclosed in note 9 overall our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note 12 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities 

  

in recording our net pension benefit we assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 825 which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception as well as our expectation of future returns a onepercentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 22 million change in pension expense we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans 

  

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our assets are longlived railway properties note 7 as disclosed in note 1 the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area 

  

depreciation expense for 2018  totaled 11 billion our composite depreciation rates for 2018  are disclosed in 

note 7 a one year increase or decrease in the estimated average useful lives of depreciable assets would have resulted in an approximate 40 million decrease or increase to depreciation expense 

k  28 

personal injury 

  

casualties and other claims expense included in “materials and other” in the consolidated statements of income includes our accrual for personal injury liabilities 

  

to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded 

for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury see note 17 

income taxes 

  

our net deferred tax liability totaled 65 billion at december 31 2018  note 4 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we have a 50 million valuation allowance on 425 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2018  reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized 

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions pursuant to the railway labor act these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the railway labor act are completed we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements 

  

the 2015 bargaining round is now complete with finalized agreements in place with all employees all of the newly negotiated agreements have moratorium provisions that will reopen the agreements for negotiation beginning january 1 2020 

  

market risks 

  

at december 31 2018  we had no outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations market risk for fixedrate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december 31 2018 and amounts to an increase of approximately 14 billion to the fair value of our debt at december 31 2018 we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 1 

k  29 

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in longlived assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

forwardlooking statements

norfolk southern corporation longterm incentive plan ltip 

  

established on june 28 1983 and approved by our stockholders at their annual meeting held on may 10 1984 ltip was adopted to promote the success of our company by providing an opportunity for nonemployee directors officers and other key employees to acquire a proprietary interest in the corporation the board of directors amended ltip on january 23 2015 which amendment was approved by shareholders on may 14 2015 to include the reservation for issuance of an additional 8000000 shares of authorized but unissued common stock 

  

the amended ltip adopted a fungible share reserve ratio so that for awards granted after may 13 2010 the number of shares remaining for issuance under the amended ltip will be reduced i by 1 for each award granted as an option or stocksettled stock appreciation right or ii by 161 for an award made in the form other than an option or stocksettled stock appreciation right any shares of common stock subject to options psus restricted shares or rsus which are not issued as common stock will again be available for award under ltip after the expiration or forfeiture of an award

for options granted after may 13 2010 the option price will be at least the higher of i the average of the high and low prices at which common stock is traded on the date of grant or ii the closing price of common stock on the date of the grant all options are subject to a vesting period of at least one year and the term of the option will not exceed ten years ltip specifically prohibits option repricing without stockholder approval except that adjustments may be made in the event of changes in our capital structure or common stock 

  

psus entitle a recipient to receive performancebased compensation at the end of a threeyear cycle based on our performance during that period for the 2018  psu awards corporate performance will be based directly on return on average capital invested with total return to stockholders serving as a modifier and will be settled in shares of common stock in 2016 the committee also granted an “accelerated turnaround incentive” award in the form of a psu with a threeyear performance that was based on equally weighted standards established by the committee for operating ratio and earnings per share we did not meet the performance criteria for operating ratio and therefore no payout for the accelerated turnaround incentive award was achieved 

  

rsus are payable in cash or in shares of common stock at the end of a restriction period during the restriction period the holder of the rsus has no beneficial ownership interest in the common stock represented by the rsus and has no right to vote the shares represented by the units or to receive dividends except for dividend equivalent payment rights that may be awarded with respect to the rsus the committee at its discretion may waive the restriction period but settlement of any rsus will occur on the same settlement date as would have applied absent a waiver of restrictions if no performance goals were imposed for the 2018  rsu awards rsus will be settled in shares of common stock

railway operating revenues   –   total railway operating revenues were 106 billion  in 2017  following is an overview of our three major market groups see the discussion of merchandise revenues by commodity group intermodal revenues and coal revenues and tonnage in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

merchandise   –  our merchandise market group is composed of five major commodity groupings 



k  5 

 

merchandise carloads handled in 2017  were 25 million  the revenues from which accounted for 60 of our total railway operating revenues 

intermodal   –  our intermodal market group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers these shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies international steamship lines truckers and other shippers intermodal units handled in 2017  were 41 million the revenues from which accounted for 23 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

coal   – revenues from coal accounted for 17 of our total railway operating revenues in 2017  we handled 116 million  tons or 10 million  carloads in 2017  most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins with the balance from major western coal basins received via the memphis and chicago gateways our coal franchise supports the electric generation market serving approximately 76 coal generation plants as well as the export domestic metallurgical and industrial markets   primarily through direct rail and river lake and coastal facilities including various terminals on the ohio river   lamberts point in norfolk virginia   the port of baltimore and lake erie 

freight rates   –  our predominant pricing mechanisms private contracts and exempt price quotes are not subject to regulation in general market forces   are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

in 2017  our railroad was found by the us surface transportation board stb the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices to be “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on results for the year 2016  the stb has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2017    a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement 

  

railway property 

  

our railroad infrastructure makes   us   capital intensive with net property of approximately  30 billion  on a historical cost basis 

property additions   –   property additions for the past five years were as follows 



our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable rail transportation services for 2018  we   have   budgeted 18 billion of property additions

the following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at december 31 2017  and   information regarding 2017  retirements 

  



track maintenance   –  of the approximately 35700 total miles of track on which we operate we are responsible for maintaining approximately 28500 miles with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance 

  

over 83 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard approximately 46 of our lines excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2017  

  

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding   our   track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 



traffic control   –  of the approximately 16400 route miles we dispatch about 11300 miles are signalized including 8500 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 2800 miles of automatic block signals of the 8500 miles of ctc approximately 7600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites 

  

environmental matters   –   compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is   one of our   principal goals to date such compliance   has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or competitive position see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

employees   –   the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 



approximately 80   of our   railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

k  8 

government regulation   –   in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all business our   railroads are subject to regulation by the stb the stb has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers 

  

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 included exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract approximately 90 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

efforts   have been made over the past several years   to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry   and such efforts are expected to continue in 2018  the staggers rail act of 1980   substantially balanced   the interests of shippers and rail carriers   and   encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly   we   will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

  

government regulations are discussed within item 1a “risk factors” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition   –   there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprogress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

our   primary rail competitor is csx   corporation csx both  ns and csx operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory we   also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable   railroads   to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations –  we continue to enhance the security of our rail system our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

our plan also complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and is integrated into hazardous material training programs additionally locationspecific security plans are in place for certain metropolitan areas and each of the six facilities we operate that are under us coast guard uscg 

k  9 

maritime security regulations with respect to these facilities each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and remains subject to inspection by the uscg 

  

additionally we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the transportation security administration the federal bureau of investigation the federal railroad administration fra the uscg us customs and border protection the department of defense and various state homeland security offices similarly we follow guidance from dhs and dot regarding rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 substantially reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest 

in 2017 through participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response transcaer program we provided rail accident response training to approximately 8185 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel our other training efforts throughout 2017 included participation in drills for local state and federal agencies we also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the security and emergency response training course conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements the information set forth in this item 1a “risk factors” should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report including item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ”  and item 8 “ financial statements and supplementary data ” 

  

significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial operating and environmental matters could affect us our customers and the markets we serve congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry   railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has   jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail   lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common   carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or   existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and on the   efficiency of our operations this potential material adverse effect   could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot and the dhs which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety and security the rail safety improvement act of 2008 rsia the surface transportation extension act of 2015 and the implementing regulations promulgated by the fra collectively “the ptc laws and regulations” require us and each other class i railroad to implement on certain mainline track where intercity and commuter passenger railroads operate and where tih hazardous materials are transported an interoperable positive train control system ptc ptc is a set of highly advanced technologies designed to prevent traintotrain collisions speedrelated derailments and certain other accidents caused by human error but ptc will not prevent all types of train accidents or incidents the ptc laws and regulations require us to install all hardware and to implement the ptc system on some of those rail lines by december 31 2018 and to implement such system on the remainder of those rail lines by december 31 2020 

full implementation of ptc in compliance with rsia as amended will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures and ptc implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses and increased claims and litigation costs 

k  10 

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions past present and future is inherent in the railroad business this risk includes property owned by us whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time 

concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs decrease the amount of traffic handled and decrease the value of coal reserves we own 

in addition legislation and regulation related to ghgs could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers even without legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that 1 use commodities that we carry to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy 

as a common carrier by rail we must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and   property including environmental damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network the cost of a catastrophic rail   accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage we have obtained insurance for potential losses for   thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements   however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if   available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

we may be affected by general economic conditions prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers 

significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and locomotives   in addition workforce demographics and training   requirements particularly for engineers and conductors could have a   negative impact on our ability to meet shortterm demand for rail service unpredicted increases in demand for rail services   may exacerbate such risks 

we may be affected by energy prices volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including but not limited to the economy demand for transportation services business related to the energy sector including crude oil natural gas and coal fuel prices and fuel surcharges 

we face competition from other transportation providers we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and quality and reliability of service while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements expenditures legislation or regulation materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate such as granting materially greater latitude 

k  11 

for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers including shortlines and regional railroads with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies additionally any significant consolidations mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption a security breach or other operational difficulties we also face cybersecurity threats which may result in breaches of systems or compromises of sensitive data which may result in an inability to access or operate systems necessary for conducting operations and providing customer service thereby impacting our efficiency andor damaging our corporate reputation additionally if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service 

the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective   bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage   or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations additionally future national   labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly   increase our costs for health care wages and other benefits 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being different from the liability recorded 

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent not covered by insurance we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues 

we may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

k  12 

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets we consumed approximately 458 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2017 fuel   availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or   rationing regulations a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in   existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage 

to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capital intensive nature as well as the industryspecific requirements of the rail industry high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials 

the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of debt instruments as well as the sale of certain receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial condition alone or in combination could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 19500 miles of road in 22 states and the district of columbia serves every major container port in the eastern united states and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a major transporter of coal automotive and industrial products 

throughout 2017 we further pursued our strategic plan focused on a balanced approach of growth increasing efficiency and delivering a strong customer service product we achieved a recordsetting railway operating ratio for the year a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses and delivered approximately 150 million of productivity savings the direct result of our commitment to achieving the targets set forth in our plan operational leverage allowed us to grow our business by providing a competitive service product to our customers while simultaneously driving productivity 

in 2018 we will continue to implement our balanced dynamic strategic plan we remain committed to consistently providing high levels of rail service and increasing the efficiency of our resources thereby generating higher returns on capital and increasing shareholder value 

summarized results of operations 



on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act “tax reform” was signed into law for more information on the impact of tax reform see note 3 as a result of the enactment of this law “purchased services and rents” includes a 151 million benefit and “income taxes” includes a 3331 million benefit which added 3482 million to “net income” and 1200 to “diluted earnings per share” the operating ratio was favorably impacted by 14 percentage points 

the following table adjusts our gaap financial results to exclude the effects of tax reform specifically the effects of remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities related to the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35 to 21 we use these nongaap financial measures internally and believe this information provides useful supplemental information to investors to facilitate making periodtoperiod comparisons by excluding the effects of tax reform while we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful in evaluating our business this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies 

k  17 

reconciliation of nongaap financial measures 



in the table below and the paragraph following references to 2017 results and related comparisons use the adjusted nongaap results from the reconciliation in the table above 



the increases in net income for both comparisons resulted from higher income from railway operations for 2017 a 7 increase in revenues was partially offset by a 4 rise in adjusted operating expenses for 2016 an 11 decline in operating expenses more than offset a 6 decrease in revenues the higher percentage increases in diluted earnings per share compared with the percentage increases in net income for both years was largely the result of our share repurchase program 

k  18 

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

the following tables present a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes units and average revenue per unit by market group 







k  19 

revenues increased 663 million in 2017 following a 623 million decline in 2016 as reflected in the table below the rise in 2017 was largely the result of increased volume particularly in our coal and intermodal markets coupled with pricing gains the decline in 2016 reflected lower revenue per unit the effects of reduced fuel surcharges and changes in traffic mix which more than offset price increases as well as lower volume primarily driven by reductions in energyrelated markets and the restructuring of our triple crown services tcs subsidiary 

  

  

most of our contracts include negotiated fuel surcharges typically tied to either west texas intermediate crude oil wti or onhighway diesel ohd approximately 90 of our revenue base is covered by these negotiated fuel surcharges with about twothirds tied to ohd for both 2017 and 2016 contracts tied to ohd accounted for about 90 of our fuel surcharge revenue as oil price levels were below most of our surcharge trigger points in contracts tied to wti revenues associated with fuel surcharges totaled 359 million 236 million and 477 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

merchandise  revenues increased in 2017 but decreased in 2016 compared with the years before in 2017 the growth was a result of higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains volume was relatively flat compared to the prior year as gains in the metals and construction group were offset by declines in automotive agriculture and chemicals traffic in 2016 the effects of lower volume were offset in part by a slight increase in average revenue per unit price increases were tempered by reduced fuel surcharge revenues and unfavorable changes in traffic mix 

for 2018  merchandise revenues are expected to increase primarily the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues 

chemicals revenues were modestly higher in 2017 following a decline in 2016 the increase in 2017 was due to higher average revenue per unit a result of favorable mix and price improvements which outweighed declines in volume both periods reflected fewer shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields and 2017 reflected lower shipments of coal ash in both periods these reductions were partially offset by more shipments of plastics the 2016 volume decline also reflected lower chloralkali and rock salt traffic the result of market consolidations and softened demand the 2016 volume decrease was offset in part by higher average revenue per unit due to favorable mix as increased volumes of higherrated plastics more than offset reduced fuel surcharge revenues 

  

for 2018  chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher the effect of favorable mix influenced by increased volumes of higherrated plastics and organic chemicals as well as overall pricing gains we expect carload declines of liquefied petroleum gas to be offset by gains in plastics industrial chemicals and crude oil 

one of our chemical customers sunbelt chlor alkali partnerships sunbelt filed in 2011 a rate reasonableness complaint before the stb alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable since april 1 2011 we have been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates in 2014 the

stb resolved this rate reasonableness complaint in our favor and in june 2016 the stb resolved petitions for reconsideration the matter remains decided in our favor however the findings are still subject to appeal we believe the estimate of any reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

agriculture consumer products and government revenues were flat in 2017 after rising in 2016 in 2017 lower traffic volume was offset by higher revenue per unit driven by pricing gains volume declines in ethanol and soybeans reflecting reduced market demand more than offset increases in fertilizer the improvement in 2016 was driven by higher average revenue per unit primarily the result of pricing gains offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues volumes decreased in 2016 driven by weaker demand for feed shipments and the effects of customer sourcing changes on corn volumes offset in part by an increase in soybean export shipments and higher food oil volumes driven by service improvements 

for 2018  agriculture consumer products and government revenues are expected to increase driven by more shipments of ethanol corn and feed products and by increased average revenue per unit primarily a result of pricing gains 

metals and construction revenues rose in both periods reflecting higher traffic volume and for 2017 higher average revenue per unit in 2017 volume growth was a result of more frac sand shipments for use in natural gas drilling in the marcellus and utica regions and more iron and steel shipments driven by continued improvement in construction activity these increases were partially offset by a decline in coil steel traffic due to customer sourcing changes revenue per unit growth in 2017 was driven by favorable changes in traffic mix the volume increase in 2016 was driven by higher demand for aggregates and iron and steel shipments and more coil steel traffic due to customer sourcing changes these increases were offset in part by lower demand for materials used in natural gas and oil drilling as a result of depressed commodity prices average revenue per unit declined in 2016 driven by lower fuel surcharge revenues and changes in traffic mix 

  

for 2018 metals and construction revenues are expected to rise primarily driven by increased revenue per unit a result of pricing gains and positive mix traffic volume growth should result from the continued rise in frac sand shipments in addition to more shipments of steel related products 

automotive revenues fell in 2017 but rose in 2016 the decline in 2017 was driven mainly by decreases in us light vehicle production as well as temporary shutdowns for retooling of several nsserved facilities average revenue per unit increased for the year driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue in 2016 volumes increased as a result of higher automotive parts shipments and growth in the production of us light vehicles lower fuel surcharge revenues offset in part by pricing gains drove the decrease in average revenue per unit in 2016 

  

for 2018  automotive revenues are expected to increase as a result of higher revenue per unit driven by price increases and higher fuel surcharge partially offset by volume declines due to reduced customer demand 

paper clay and forest products revenues rose in 2017 following a decline in 2016 the increase in 2017 was due to higher revenue per unit a result of pricing gains and changes in the traffic mix traffic was flat for the year as increases in waste and pulp shipments were offset by continued losses in woodchip volume due to customer sourcing changes the decline in 2016 reflected volume decreases in our pulpboard and woodchip markets due to customer sourcing changes in addition to lower paper shipments as a result of decreased demand and further contraction of the paper market average revenue per unit increased in 2016 driven by pricing gains offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues 

  

for 2018  paper clay and forest products revenues are anticipated to increase reflecting pricing gains and increased volume driven by growth in pulpboard as a result of tightening truck capacity lumber due to more construction activity and our miscellaneous waste markets these increases may be partially offset by weaker export demand for kaolin shipments and further contraction of the paper market 

k  21 

intermodal  revenues increased in 2017 but declined in 2016 compared to the prior years the 2017 increase resulted from higher traffic volume and higher average revenue per unit driven by fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains the decline in 2016 was due to lower average revenue per unit that more than offset a small volume increase reduced fuel surcharge revenues and the effects of the tcs subsidiary restructuring which together lowered average revenue per unit 57 offset the effects of price increases 

for 2018 we expect higher intermodal revenues due to increased average revenue per unit driven by higher fuel surcharge revenues and rate increases as well as higher volumes 

intermodal units by market were as follows 



total domestic  volume increased in 2017 but decreased 2016 a result of the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary which decreased overall domestic volume domestic volumes in both years benefitted from continued highway conversions and growth from new and existing accounts 

for 2018 we expect higher domestic volumes driven by strong demand due to favorable economic conditions combined with continued highway conversions 

international  volume increased in both years reflecting increased demand from existing customers and market share gains 

  

for 2018 we expect continued growth in our international volume largely driven by more traffic from both new and existing customers 

coal  revenues increased in 2017 but decreased in 2016 compared with the prior years the increase in 2017 was a result of higher volume primarily in the export market and higher revenue per unit driven by fuel surcharge revenue and pricing gains the 2016 decline was a result of lower carload volumes across all markets and decreased average revenue per unit primarily due to reduced fuel surcharge revenues that lowered average revenue per unit by 34 in 2016 

for 2018  coal revenues are expected to decline driven by lower export and utility volumes in addition to decreased revenue per unit primarily the result of lower pricing in our export market 

k  22 

as shown in the following table tonnage increased in 2017 but decreased in 2016 



utility coal  tonnage increased in 2017 driven by market share gains both years were affected by limited coal burn due to milder weather and sustained lower natural gas prices the decline in 2016 was additionally impacted by residual customer stockpile overhang 

for 2018  we expect utility tonnage to decrease the result of continued pressure from natural gas prices and new renewable and natural gas capacity 

export coal  tonnage grew significantly in 2017 as continued tightening of international coal supply drove incremental production increases and higher demand for us coal in 2016 the decrease was a result of strong competition faced by us coal suppliers as excess coal supply weak seaborne coal prices and a strong us dollar reduced demand volume through norfolk was up 55 million  tons or 57  in 2017 following a drop of 17 million tons or 15 in 2016 volume through baltimore was up 64 million tons or 129 in 2017 and was up slightly in 2016 

  

for 2018  we expect export coal tonnage to decrease due to expected contraction of the elevated 2017 market 

  

domestic metallurgical coal  tonnage was up in 2017 but down in 2016 in 2017 the increase was a result of market share gains while the 2016 decline was largely driven by softness in the metallurgical market 

for 2018  domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to remain relatively flat yearoveryear 

industrial coal  tonnage decreased in both years a result of plant outages natural gas conversions and decreased coal burn 

  

for 2018  industrial coal tonnage is expected to increase driven by increased customer demand but will continue to face pressure due to natural gas conversions and customer sourcing changes 

k  23 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications were as follows 



in 2017  we experienced an overall increase in expense compared to the prior year reflecting higher fuel expense incentive compensation inflationary increases and volumerelated costs partially offset by improved productivity and increased equity in earnings of certain investees as a result of the enactment of tax reform in 2016 expenses were lower across all categories driven largely from costcontrol initiatives lower fuel expense the absence of restructuring costs incurred in 2015 and service improvements 

compensation and benefits increased in 2017 reflecting changes in 

 

in 2016  compensation and benefits decreased a result of changes in 

 

our employment averaged 27110 in 2017  compared with 28044 in 2016  and 30456 in 2015  

k  24 

purchased services and rents  includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals as previously discussed this line item includes a 151 million benefit from the enactment of tax reform 36 million in purchased services and 115 million in equipment rents in the form of higher income of certain equity investees 



the remaining increase in purchased services expense was a result of higher intermodal volumerelated costs the 2016 decrease reflected lower tcs operational costs reduced repair and maintenance expenses and decreased transportation activity costs offset in part by higher intermodal volumerelated costs 

equipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment decreased in both 2017 and 2016 in 2017 in addition to the effects of tax reform the decline was a result of lower automotive volume in 2016 the decrease was largely from improved network velocity partly offset by higher rates and conventional intermodal volumes 

fuel  expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations increased in 2017 but decreased in 2016 the change in both years was principally due to locomotive fuel prices up 22 in 2017 and down 18 in 2016 locomotive fuel consumption decreased 1 in 2017 despite an increase in volume of 5 and declined 5 in 2016 with a volume decrease of 3 both the direct result of our strategic initiative to increase fuel efficiency we consumed approximately 458 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2017 compared with 462 million gallons in 2016 and 487 million gallons in 2015 

depreciation  expense increased in 2017 but decreased in 2016 both periods reflect growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock in 2016 the decrease was a result of the effects of 63 million in accelerated depreciation related to the tcs restructuring in 2015 

materials and other  expenses decreased in both periods as shown in the following table 



  

material usage declined in both periods a result of lower freight car repairs associated with costcontrol initiatives and improved asset utilization 

k  25 

casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters the decrease in 2017 was the result of lower loss and damage offset in part by unfavorable developments in personal injury cases the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher derailment expenses 

both declines in other expenses reflected more gains from the sale of operating properties up 42 million in 2017 and 37 million in 2016 the 2016 decline was also driven by the absence of expenses that occurred in 2015 for relocating employees in connection with the closure of our roanoke virginia office 

income taxes 

  

income taxes in 2017 includes a benefit of 3331 million related to the effects of the enactment of tax reform from the reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities driven by the change in the federal rate our tax benefit on 2017 income resulted in an effective rate of negative 728 which includes negative 1065 related to tax reform compared with 354 in 2016 and 363 in 2015 both 2017 and 2016 benefited from favorable tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and higher returns from corporateowned life insurance the 2016 and 2015 years also benefited from favorable reductions in deferred taxes for state tax law changes and certain business tax credits 

we expect our effective tax rate to approximate 24 on a goforward basis in addition we expect cash paid for income taxes to be approximately 25 lower than 2017 levels which is less than the percentage decline in the effective rate as 2017 benefited from accelerated tax deductions related to our two debt exchanges see note 8 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities  our principal source of liquidity was 33 billion  in 2017   30 billion  in 2016  and 29 billion in   2015  the increases in both 2017 and 2016 were primarily the result of improved operating results we had working capital deficits of 396 million and 48 million at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively cash and cash equivalents totaled 690 million  and 956 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations 

contractual obligations at december 31 2017  were comprised of longterm debt interest on fixedrate longterm debt note 8 unconditional purchase obligations note 16 operating leases note 9 agreements with consolidated rail corporation crc and longterm advances from conrail note 5 and unrecognized tax benefits note 3 



  

 this amount is shown in the other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

k  26 

off balance sheet arrangements  consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9 

  

cash used in investing activities  was 15 billion  in 2017  compared with 18 billion  in 2016  and 21 billion  in 2015  both yearoveryear comparisons reflected lower cash outflows for property additions a decline in corporateowned life insurance investments additionally impacted 2017 the decrease in 2016 is also a reflection of lower proceeds from corporateowned life insurance investments 

capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the “railway property” section of part i of this report on form 10k for 2018 we expect capital spending to total 18 billion 

cash used in financing activities  was 20 billion  in 2017  compared with 13 billion  in 2016  and 693 million  in 2015  both yearoveryear comparisons reflected lower debt proceeds in 2017 the rise was further affected by increased repurchases of common stock contributing to the increase in 2016 were higher debt repayments partially offset by lower repurchases of common stock 

share repurchases totaled 10 billion  in 2017  803 million  in 2016  and 11 billion  in 2015  for the purchase and retirement of 82 million  92 million  and 113 million  shares respectively on september 26 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock through december 31 2022 as of december 31 2017 565 million  shares remain authorized for repurchase the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash cash on hand or proceeds from borrowings 

in may of 2017 we issued 300 million of 315 senior notes due 2027 in august of 2017 we issued 750 million of 405 senior notes due 2052 as part of a debt exchange for 551 million of previously issued notes in november of 2017 we issued 750 million of senior notes at 394 due 2047 and paid 52 million of premium in exchange for 613 million of previously issued notes see note 8 

  

we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 8 and we have authority from our board of directors to issue an additional 12 billion  of debt or equity securities through public or private sale all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise our debttototal capitalization ratio was 375 at december 31 2017  compared with 451 at december 31 2016  

  

upcoming annual debt maturities are disclosed in note 8 overall our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note 1 

k  27 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities 

  

in recording our net pension benefit we assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 825 which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception as well as our expectation of future returns a onepercentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 22 million change in pension expense we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans 

  

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our assets are longlived railway properties note 6 as disclosed in note 1 the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area 

  

depreciation expense for 2017  totaled 11 billion our composite depreciation rates for 2017  are disclosed in 

note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 40 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense for 2017  roadway depreciation rates ranged from 083  to 2912 and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 138  to 33 

  

personal injury 

  

casualties and other claims expense included in “materials and other” in the consolidated statements of income includes our accrual for personal injury liabilities 

  

to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue with respect to such claims during the year we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded 

for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury see note 16 

income taxes 

  

our net deferred tax liability totaled 63 billion  at december 31 2017  note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the 

k  28 

federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we have a 44 million  valuation allowance on 366 million  of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2017  reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized see discussion of tax reform in note 3 

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

  

approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions pursuant to the railway labor act these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the railway labor act are completed we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee nccc moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements 

beginning in late 2014 the nccc and the various unions exchanged new proposals to begin the current round of national negotiations   the unions formed three separate bargaining coalitions   and the nccc has reached agreements with 2 of these coalitions representing 10 separate unions and approximately 80 of the unionized workforce some of these agreements applicable to approximately 10 of the unionized workforce are still pending ratification by the union membership while the rest have already been ratified and are now final    negotiations with the other coalition is ongoing with the assistance of mediators from the national mediation board in accordance with the railway labor act current agreements will remain in effect during the statutory bargaining process separately ns has reached agreement covering wages and work rules through 2019 with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet which represents approximately 4600 ns engineers 

  

market risks 

  

we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments at december 31 2017  debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 100 million a onepercentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately 1 million we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 1 

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in longlived assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost

the miles operated which include major leased lines between cincinnati ohio and chattanooga tennessee and an exclusive operating agreement for   trackage rights over property owned by north carolina railroad company were as follows 

  



  

the following table sets forth certain statistics relating to   our   railroads’ operations for the past five years 

  



railway operating revenues   –   total railway operating revenues were 99 billion  in 2016  following is an overview of our three major market groups see the discussion of merchandise revenues by commodity group intermodal revenues and coal revenues and tonnage in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

merchandise   –  our merchandise market group is composed of five major commodity groupings 

 

merchandise carloads handled in 2016  were 25 million  the revenues from which accounted for 63 of our total railway operating revenues 

k  5 

intermodal   –  our intermodal market group consists of shipments moving in trailers domestic and international containers and roadrailer® equipment these shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies international steamship lines truckers and other shippers intermodal units handled in 2016  were 39 million the revenues from which accounted for 22 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

coal   – revenues from coal accounted for about 15 of our total railway operating revenues in 2016  we handled 100 million  tons or 09 million  carloads in 2016  most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins with the balance from major western coal basins received via the memphis and chicago gateways our coal franchise supports the electric generation market serving approximately 78 coal generation plants as well as the export metallurgical and industrial markets   primarily through direct rail and river lake and coastal facilities including various terminals on the ohio river   lamberts point in norfolk virginia   the port of baltimore and lake erie 

freight rates   –  our predominant pricing mechanisms private contracts and exempt price quotes are not subject to regulation in general market forces   are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

in 2016  our railroad was found by the us surface transportation board stb the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices to not be “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on results for the year 2015  the stb has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2016    a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement 

  

passenger operations   –   amtrak operates regularly scheduled passenger trains on our lines between the following locations 

   

a consortium of two transportation commissions of the commonwealth of virginia operate commuter trains on our   line between manassas and alexandria 

  

we   lease the chicago to manhattan illinois line to the commuter rail division of the regional transportation authority of northeast illinois metra 

we   operate freight service over lines with significant ongoing amtrak and commuter passenger operations and conduct   freight operations over trackage owned or leased by 

 

amtrak   and various   commuter agencies conduct passenger operations over trackage owned by conrail inc conrail in the shared assets areas note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

k  6 

noncarrier operations   –   our   noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment the development of commercial real estate telecommunications and the acquisition leasing and management of coal oil gas and minerals in 2016  no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment under relevant authoritative accounting guidance

our railroad infrastructure makes   us   capital intensive with net property of approximately 30 billion on a historical cost basis 

property additions   –   property additions for the past five years were as follows 



our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable rail transportation services for 2017  we   have   budgeted 19   billion of property additions see further discussion of our planned capital spending and replacement programs in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the subheading “financial condition liquidity and capital resources”

the following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at december 31 2016  and   information regarding 2016  retirements 

  



track maintenance   –  of the approximately 35600 total miles of track on which we operate we are responsible for maintaining approximately 28500 miles with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance 

  

over 83 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard approximately 43 of our lines excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2016  

  

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding   our   track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 



traffic control   –  of the approximately 16400 route miles we dispatch about 11300 miles are signalized including 8500 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 2800 miles of automatic block signals of the 8500 miles of ctc approximately 7600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites 

  

environmental matters   –   compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is   one of our   principal goals to date such compliance   has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or competitive position see “personal injury environmental and legal liabilities” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

k  9 

employees   –   the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 



approximately 80   of our   railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

government regulation   –   in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all business our   railroads are subject to regulation by the stb the stb has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers 

  

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 included exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract approximately 90 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

efforts   have been made over the past several years   to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry   and such efforts are expected to continue in 2017  the staggers rail act of 1980   substantially balanced   the interests of shippers and rail carriers   and   encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly   we   will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

  

government regulations are discussed within item 1a “risk factors” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition   –   there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprogress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

our   primary rail competitor is csx   corporation csx both   railroads   operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory we   also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable   railroads   to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations –  we continue to take measures to enhance the security of our rail system our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the 

k  10 

association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

our plan also complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and is integrated into hazardous material training programs additionally locationspecific security plans are in place for certain metropolitan areas and each of the six port facilities we serve with respect to the ports each facility ’ s security plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and remains subject to inspection by the us coast guard uscg 

  

additionally we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the   transportation security administration the federal bureau of investigation the federal railroad administration   fra the uscg us customs and border protection and various state homeland security offices similarly we follow guidance from dhs and dot regarding rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 substantially reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest 

in 2016 through participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response transcaer program we provided rail accident response training to approximately 5573 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel our other training efforts throughout 2016 included participation in drills for local state and federal agencies we also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the security and emergency response training course conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado 




 item 1a risk factors 

the risks set forth in the following risk factors could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forwardlooking statements the information set forth in this item 1a risk factors should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this annual report including item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ”  and item 8 “ financial statements and supplementary data ” 

  

significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial operating and environmental matters could affect us our customers and the markets we serve congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry   railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has   jurisdiction to varying extents over rates routes customer access provisions fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail   lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common   carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or   existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and on the   efficiency of our operations this potential material adverse effect   could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

k  11 

railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the dot and the dhs which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety and security the rail safety improvement act of 2008 rsia the surface transportation extension act of 2015 and the implementing regulations promulgated by the fra require us and each other class i railroad to implement an interoperable positive train control system ptc on certain of our respective lines by december 31 2018 

full implementation of ptc in compliance with rsia will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures and ptc implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses and increased claims and litigation costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability for acts and omissions past present and future is inherent in the railroad business this risk includes property owned by us whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time 

concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs decrease the amount of traffic handled and decrease the value of coal reserves we own 

in addition legislation and regulation could negatively affect the markets we serve and our customers including those related to ghgs even without legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could negatively affect the markets for certain of the commodities we carry and our customers that 1 use commodities that we carry to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy 

as a common carrier by rail we must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and   property including environmental damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network the cost of a catastrophic rail   accident involving hazardous materials could exceed our insurance coverage we have obtained insurance for potential losses for   thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements   however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if   available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

we may be affected by general economic conditions prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions could affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry economic conditions could also result in bankruptcies of one or more large customers 

significant increases in demand for rail services could result in the unavailability of qualified personnel and locomotives   in addition workforce demographics and training   requirements particularly for engineers and conductors could have a   negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredicted increases in demand for rail services   may exacerbate such risks 

k  12 

we may be affected by energy prices volatility in energy prices could have a significant effect on a variety of items including but not limited to the economy demand for transportation services business related to the energy sector including crude oil natural gas and coal fuel prices and fuel surcharges 

we face competition from other transportation providers we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and quality and reliability of service while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements expenditures legislation or regulation materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate such as granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations or adoption of autonomous commercial vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain collaborative relationships with connecting carriers including shortlines and regional railroads with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies additionally any significant consolidations mergers or operational changes among other railroads may significantly redefine our market access and reach 

we rely on technology and technology improvements in our business operations if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption a security breach or other operational difficulties accordingly we also face cybersecurity threats which may result in breaches of systems or compromises of sensitive data which may result in an inability to access or operate systems necessary for conducting operations and providing customer service thereby impacting our efficiency andor damaging our corporate reputation additionally if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service 

the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective   bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage   or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations additionally future national   labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly   increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits 

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded 

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent not covered by insurance we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements however insurance is available 

k  13 

from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues 

we may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets we consumed approximately 462 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2016 fuel   availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or   rationing regulations a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in   existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage 

to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capital intensive nature as well as the industryspecific requirements of the rail industry high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials changes in the competitive landscapes of these limited supplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials 

the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity from timetotime we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of longterm debt instruments and commercial paper as well as the sale of certain receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial condition alone or in combination could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 19500 miles of road in 22 states and the district of columbia serves every major container port in the eastern united states and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a major transporter of coal automotive and industrial products 

our 2016 results reflect our progress and commitment to achieving the goals set forth in our strategic plan through a disciplined costcontrol focus we achieved a recordsetting railway operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses of 689 and delivered approximately 250 million of productivity savings despite the economic challenges that continue to affect our industry operational improvements allowed us to maintain near alltime best service levels and achieve high levels of network fluidity which improved train performance and asset utilization in addition to these improvements the implementation of multiple costcontrol initiatives drove savings in operating expenses across all categories 

in 2017 we expect to maintain high levels of service and see continued improvement in our operating ratio railway operating revenues are expected to increase driven by volume growth in our coal and intermodal markets in addition to higher average revenue per unit a result of pricing gains and fuel surcharge revenue increases largely driven by higher expected fuel prices railway operating expenses are expected to increase next year driven in large part by medical and wage inflation as well as volumerelated expenses offset in part by the continuation of targeted expense reductions as we balance resources with the demand for our highquality rail service we continue to focus on executing our strategic plan and remain committed to maintaining our strong levels of rail service generating higher returns on capital and increasing the efficiency of our resources 

summarized results of operations 



the increase in net income for 2016 compared to 2015 was driven by higher income from railway operations as railway operating expense decreases down 813 million or 11 more than offset declines in railway operating revenues down 623 million or 6 the decrease in net income for 2015 compared to 2014 reflected lower income from railway operations driven by a sharp decline in railway operating revenues down 11 billion or 10 offset in part by lower railway operating expenses down 422 million or 5 the 2015 results include 93 million of costs associated with the restructuring of our triple crown services tcs subsidiary and the closure of our roanoke virginia corporate office which reduced net income by 58 million or 019 per diluted share 

k  19 

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

the following tables present a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes units and average revenue per unit by market group 







k  20 

revenues decrease d 623 million  in 2016  and 11 billion  in 2015  as reflected in the table below both declines resulted from lower average revenue per unit and reduced volume in 2016 the effects of reduced fuel surcharges and changes in traffic mix more than offset price increases volume decreases were primarily driven by reductions in energyrelated markets and the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary for 2015 a large drop in fuel surcharge revenues more than offset pricing gains to drive average revenue per unit lower the volume decline was driven by continued weakness in the coal markets 

  

most of our contracts include negotiated fuel surcharges typically tied to either west texas intermediate crude oil wti or onhighway diesel ohd approximately 90 of our revenue base is covered by these negotiated fuel surcharges with more than half tied to ohd for 2016 contracts tied to ohd accounted for about 90 of our fuel surcharge revenue as price levels were below most of our surcharge trigger points in contracts tied to wti revenues associated with fuel surcharges totaled 236 million 477 million and 1329 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

merchandise  revenues decreased for both 2016 and 2015 compared with the years before in 2016 the effects of lower volume were offset in part by a slight increase in average revenue per unit price increases were tempered by reduced fuel surcharge revenues which lowered average revenue per unit by 31 and unfavorable changes in traffic mix the   2015  decline reflected lower average revenue per unit the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues which reduced average revenue per unit by 185 that offset the effects of higher rates volume was relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 

for 2017  merchandise revenues are expected to increase primarily the result of pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues 

chemicals  revenues were lower yearoveryear in 2016 and 2015 the 2016 decline was due to lower traffic volume reflecting fewer shipments of crude oil originated from the bakken oil fields in addition to lower chloralkali and rock salt traffic the result of market consolidations and softened demand these declines were offset in part by higher average revenue per unit due to favorable mix as increased volumes of higherrated plastics more than offset reduced fuel surcharge revenues 

  

in 2015  the decline was the result of lower average revenue per unit driven by reduced fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix resulting from increased shipments of lowerrated liquefied petroleum gas which more than offset the effect of higher rates volumes increased for the year largely driven by liquefied petroleum gas volume gains as well as strong demand for shipments of polypropylene due to lower feedstock prices these volume increases were partially offset by fewer shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields 

  

for 2017  chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher largely the effect of favorable mix driven by increased volumes of higherrated plastics and pricing gains however we expect these gains to be mitigated by lower shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields and liquefied petroleum gas in the utica shale region 

k  21 

one of our chemical customers sunbelt chlor alkali partnership sunbelt filed a rate reasonableness complaint before the stb alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable since april 1 2011 we have been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates in 2014 the stb resolved this rate reasonableness complaint in our favor in june 2016 the stb resolved petitions for reconsideration the matter remains decided in our favor however the findings are still subject to appeal we believe the estimate of any reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity with regard to rate cases we record adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and reasonably estimable 

agriculture consumer products and government  revenues increased for both years compared with the years before the improvement in 2016 was driven by higher average revenue per unit primarily the result of pricing gains offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues volumes decreased for the year driven by weaker demand for feed shipments and the effects of customer sourcing changes on corn volumes offset in part by an increase in soybean export shipments and higher food oil volumes driven by service improvements 

the increase in 2015 was the result of more ethanol shipments due to higher gasoline consumption offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues and fewer revenue shipments of empty rail cars as part of the conclusion of a hopper rebody program 

for 2017  agriculture consumer products and government revenues are expected to increase driven by more shipments of corn and feed products and by increased average revenue per unit primarily a result of pricing gains 

metals and construction  revenues were up slightly in 2016  after falling in 2015 compared with the prior years the increase in 2016 was driven by higher demand for aggregates and iron and steel shipments and more coil steel traffic due to customer sourcing changes these increases were offset in part by lower demand for materials used in natural gas and oil drilling as a result of depressed commodity prices average revenue per unit declined for the year driven by lower fuel surcharge revenues and changes in traffic mix 

in 2015  the decline  was driven by a drop in average revenue per unit largely the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues partially offset by pricing gains and a decrease in carloads the volume decline was the result of lower demand for materials used in the construction of pipe for drilling activity fewer shipments of fractionating sand and ceramic proppant used in natural gas drilling and declines in scrap metal and coil shipments resulting from declines in steel production due to global oversupply these decreases were offset in part by increased shipments of aggregates as a result of higher demand in the southeast for project work and strong highway and construction related markets 

for 2017 metals and construction revenues are expected to increase as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher primarily due to changes in the mix of traffic we also expect volumes to increase next year driven by growth in steel related products in addition to higher cement shipments driven by increased construction activity 

automotive revenues rose  in 2016 after falling in 2015 compared with the prior years for 2016 volumes increased as a result of higher automotive parts shipments and growth in the production of north american light vehicles average revenue per unit declined for the year driven by lower fuel surcharge revenues offset in part by pricing gains 

the decline in 2015  reflected a drop in average revenue per unit primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenues offset in part by pricing gains volumes increased for the year driven by gains in production of north american light vehicles 

  

for 2017  automotive revenues are expected to decrease as a result of volume declines related to extended retooling at several nsserved assembly plants and expected decreases in us vehicle production offset in part by higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenues 

k  22 

paper clay and forest products  revenues were down in both 2016 and 2015 compared to the prior years the decline in 2016 reflected volume decreases in our pulpboard and woodchip markets due to customer sourcing changes in addition to lower paper shipments as a result of decreased demand and further contraction of the paper market average revenue per unit increased for the year driven by pricing gains offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues 

in 2015  both average revenue per unit and volumes decreased the decline in average revenue per unit was driven primarily by lower fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix fewer higherrated kaolin shipments offset by pricing gains volume changes reflected lower waste kaolin woodchip and graphic paper volumes as a result of customer sourcing changes softened demand and mill closures offset by higher carloads of pulpboard lumber and pulp due to continued recovery of the housing market 

for 2017  paper clay and forest products revenues are anticipated to increase as we expect average revenue per unit to be higher largely due to pricing gains additionally we expect volume to increase next year driven by growth in our miscellaneous waste and lumber markets as a result of higher construction activity and increased pulp volumes driven by growth in consumer demand these volume increases will be partially offset by lower pulpboard shipments due to customer sourcing changes weaker export demand for kaolin shipments and further contraction of the paper market 

intermodal  revenues decreased in both years a result of lower average revenue per unit that more than offset small volume increases in 2016 reduced fuel surcharge revenues and the effects of the tcs subsidiary restructuring which together lowered average revenue per unit 57 offset the effects of price increases volume was up slightly for the year as growth in our domestic and international business offset the losses from the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary in 2015  lower average revenue per unit was the result of lower fuel surcharges which decreased average revenue per unit by 51 volume gains in international shipments were almost fully offset by declines in domestic shipments 

for 2017 we expect higher intermodal revenues due to increased volumes and average revenue per unit primarily driven by higher fuel surcharge revenues and pricing gains 

intermodal units by market were as follows 



k  23 

total domestic  volume decreased in both years driven by the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary in 2016 domestic volumes excluding tcs increased due to growth from new and existing accounts that exceeded the negative effects of increased trucking capacity in 2015 volumes were also affected by ongoing service challenges during the first three quarters of the year an increase in available trucking capacity and weaker overall demand all partially offset by growth from continued highway conversions 

for 2017 we expect higher domestic volumes driven from continued highway conversions and growth associated with new and existing customers 

international  volume increased in both years reflecting increased demand from existing customers and market share gains 

  

for 2017 we expect continued growth in our international volume largely driven by more traffic from both new and existing customers 

coal  revenues decreased in each of 2016 and 2015 compared with the prior years both declines reflected lower carload volumes and decreased average revenue per unit primarily due to reduced fuel surcharge revenues which lowered average revenue per unit by 34 in 2016 and 134 in 2015 

for 2017  coal revenues are expected to increase driven largely by higher utility and export volumes in addition to an improved average revenue per unit primarily the result of pricing gains in our export market and higher fuel surcharges 

as shown in the following table tonnage decreased in all markets both years 



utility coal  tonnage in 2016 reflected residual stockpile overhang and limited coal burn due to milder weather and sustained lower natural gas prices for 2015 the decline was driven by reduced coal burn as significantly lower natural gas prices caused utilities to shift away from coal generation in addition volumes were adversely affected by coal plant retirements and mild weather during the last half of 2015 

for 2017  we expect utility tonnage to increase driven by higher natural gas prices and weatherrelated normalization in addition to market share gains 

export coal  tonnage also decreased both years a result of strong competition faced by us coal suppliers as excess coal supply weak seaborne coal prices and a strong us dollar reduced demand for export coal volume through norfolk was down 17 million  tons or 15  in 2016 following a drop of 55 million  tons or 33  in 2015 volume through baltimore was up slightly in 2016 but was down 15 million tons or 23 in 2015 

  

for 2017  we expect export coal tonnage to increase as higher prices from a tightening of the international coal supply a continued trend from the last quarter of 2016 is expected to drive incremental production increases 

  

k  24 

domestic metallurgical coal  tonnage was down in both years compared with the prior periods the 2016 decline was largely driven by softness in the metallurgical market offset in part by customerspecific gains the 2015 decrease reflected volume losses related to plant curtailments and sourcing shifts resulting from steel producers looking for opportunities to reduce costs that were offset in part by market share gains 

for 2017  domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to remain relatively flat as customerspecific gains will offset losses from sourcing shifts and supply issues driven by increased demand in export markets 

industrial coal  tonnage dropped in both years compared with the prior periods both years reflected volume losses related to natural gas conversions and decreased coal burn both of which accelerated in 2016 in addition 2016 volumes were further affected by a partial plant closure that took place in the first half of the year 

  

for 2017  industrial coal tonnage is expected to decrease driven by continued pressure from natural gas conversions and customer sourcing changes 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications were as follows 



in 2016  we experienced decreases across all categories driven largely from costcontrol initiatives lower fuel expense the absence of restructuring costs incurred in 2015 and service improvements in 2015  decreases in fuel costs and incentive compensation were offset in part by costs associated with the tcs restructuring and closure of our roanoke virginia corporate office in addition to higher wage rates 

k  25 

compensation and benefits decreased in 2016  compared to 2015 reflecting changes in 

 

in 2015  compensation and benefits increased slightly a result of changes in 

 

our employment averaged 28044 in 2016  compared with 30456 in 2015  and 29482 in 2014  looking forward to 2017 we expect higher compensation and benefit expenses a result of wage increases medical cost inflation and higher levels of incentive compensation we anticipate that costcontrol initiatives will keep employment levels flat notwithstanding expected volume increases 

purchased services and rents  includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals 



the 2016 decrease in purchased services expense reflected lower tcs operational costs reduced repair and maintenance expenses and decreased transportation activity costs offset in part by higher volumerelated costs in intermodal operations the increase in 2015 reflected higher costs associated with intermodal operations information technology maintenance and repair and the roanoke virginia corporate office closure partially offset by tcs restructuringrelated savings 

equipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment decreased in 2016 largely from improved network velocity offset in part by higher rates and conventional intermodal volumes the 2015 increase was principally due to higher automotive and intermodal rates and volumes 

fuel  expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations decreased in both 2016 and 2015 compared with the prior years both declines were principally the result of lower locomotive fuel prices down 18 in 2016 and 40 in 2015 locomotive fuel consumption decreased 5 in 2016 and 1 in 2015 we consumed approximately 462 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2016 compared with 487 million gallons in 2015 and 494 million gallons in 2014 

k  26 

depreciation  expense decreased in 2016 but increased in 2015 compared to prior years a result of the effects of the tcs restructuring in 2015 we recognized 63 million in accelerated depreciation on tcs assets as a result of the restructuring both periods also reflect growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock 

materials and other  expenses decreased in 2016 but increased in 2015 as shown in the following table 



  

in 2016 lower materials and other expenses more than offset higher costs for casualties and other claims material usage costs declined for the year primarily driven by lower locomotive roadway and freight car repair costs associated with costcontrol initiatives and improved asset utilization 

casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters the increase in 2016 was primarily driven by higher derailment expenses the small rise in 2015 reflected less favorable personal injury reserve adjustments for prior years’ claim amounts offset in part by reduced environmental remediation costs as a result of less unfavorable development for our environmental liability 

other expense this year reflected 37 million of gains from the sale of operating land both yearoveryear variances were affected by higher than normal expenses in 2015 relocating employees in connection with the closure of our roanoke virginia office the 2015 increase also included higher travel costs for train service employees and higher property taxes 

  

income taxes 

  

the effective income tax rate was 354 in 2016 compared with 363 in 2015 and 362 in 2014 the decrease in 2016 reflects favorable tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation and higher returns from corporateowned life insurance all three years benefited from favorable reductions in deferred taxes for state tax law changes and certain business tax credits

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities  our principal source of liquidity was 30 billion  in 2016  and 29 billion in both 2015  and   2014  the increase in 2016 was primarily the result of improved operating results lower cash from operations in 2015  compared with 2014  was offset by reduced tax payments we had a working capital deficit of 48 million at december 31 2016  compared with working capital of 281 million at december 31 2015  cash and cash equivalents totaled 10 billion  and 11 billion  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and were invested in accordance with our corporate investment policy the portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk there are no limits or restrictions on our access to these assets we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations 

contractual obligations at december 31 2016  were comprised of interest on fixedrate longterm debt longterm debt note 8 unconditional purchase obligations note 16 operating leases note 9 longterm advances from conrail and agreements with consolidated rail corporation crc note 5 and unrecognized tax benefits note 3 

  



  

 this amount is shown in the other column because the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated 

  

off balance sheet arrangements  consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9 

  

cash used in investing activities  was 18 billion  in 2016  compared with 21 billion  in 2015  and 20 billion  in 2014  both yearoveryear comparisons reflected higher cash outflows for property additions in 2015 including approximately 215 million for the acquisition of the delaware and hudson railway co line in addition 2015 included higher proceeds from corporateowned life insurance investments 

capital spending and track and equipment statistics can be found within the “railway property” section of part i of this report on form 10k 

for 2017  we have budgeted 19 billion for property additions the anticipated spending includes 930 million for the normalized replacement of rail ties and ballast the improvement or replacement of bridges and other maintenance of way items planned equipment spending of 340 million includes new and rebuilt locomotives mill gondolas automobile multilevel recertifications and covered hoppers investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be 170 million and include terminals and equipment to add capacity to our intermodal network expanded bulk transfer facilities improvements to vehicle distribution facilities and upgrades and expansions of our mechanical service shops for 2017  we have budgeted 240 million for the continued implementation of ptc and expect post2017 ptcrelated property additions to total approximately 300 million technology and other 

k  28 

investments of 110 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers we also expect to spend 80 million on infrastructure improvements to increase mainline capacity and to accommodate business growth 

cash used in financing activities  was 13 billion  in 2016  compared with 693 million  in 2015  and 14 billion  in 2014  the increase in 2016 was driven primarily by higher debt repayments and lower proceeds from borrowing partially offset by lower share repurchase activity the decrease in 2015 was driven primarily by higher proceeds from borrowings and lower debt repayments partially offset by higher share repurchase activity 

share repurchases totaled 803 million  in 2016  11 billion  in 2015  and 318 million  in 2014  for the purchase and retirement of 92 million  113 million  and 31 million  shares respectively on august 1 2012 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock through december 31 2017 and 147 million  shares remain under this authority as of december 31 2016  the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash cash on hand or proceeds from borrowings 

  

we discuss our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 8 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and we have authority from our board of directors to issue an additional 12 billion  of debt or equity securities through public or private sale all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise our debttototal capitalization ratio was 451 at december 31 2016  compared with 453 at december 31 2015  

  

upcoming annual debt maturities are relatively modest note 8 overall our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we regularly discuss the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities 

  

in recording our net pension benefit we assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 825 which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception as well as our expectation of future returns a onepercentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 21 million change in pension expense we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality they are not expected to have 

k  29 

a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans 

  

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our assets are longlived railway properties note 6 as disclosed in note 1 the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area 

  

depreciation expense for 2016  totaled 10 billion  our composite depreciation rates for 2016  are disclosed in 

note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 39 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense for 2016  roadway depreciation rates ranged from 083  to 1486 and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 138  to 3018 

  

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

  

casualties and other claims expense included in “materials and other” in the consolidated statements of income consists primarily of our accrual for personal injury liabilities and environmental remediation costs 

  

to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded 

  

we are subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations we record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates additionally our environmental policy council composed of senior managers oversees and interprets our environmental policy 

we andor certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to earnings 

for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury and environmental matters see note 16 

k  30 

income taxes 

  

our net deferred tax liability totaled 91 billion  at december 31 2016  note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we have a 39 million  valuation allowance on 628 million  of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2016  reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized 

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

  

approximately 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions pursuant to the railway labor act these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the act are completed we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee nccc moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements 

beginning in late 2014 the nccc and the various unions exchanged new proposals to begin the current round of national negotiations   the unions have formed three separate bargaining coalitions   and negotiations with each are ongoing with the assistance of mediators from the national mediation board separately in january 2015 we reached an agreement covering wages and work rules through 2019 with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet which represents approximately 20 of our union workforce changes to the blet benefit plan will be bargained nationally through the nccc 

  

market risks 

  

we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments at december 31 2016  debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 200 million a onepercentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately 2 million we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements see note 1 

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in longlived assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

forwardlooking statements

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the assistance of management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act at december 31 2016  based on such evaluation our officers have concluded that at december 31 2016  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time period specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data we recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

  

in order to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective we regularly assess such controls and did so most recently as of december 31 2016  this assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework   2013  based on our assessment we have concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2016  

  

our board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies financial reporting and internal control the audit committee of our board of directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management the independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee 

  

we have issued a report of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2016  these reports appear in part ii item 8 of this report on form 10k

the miles operated which include major leased lines between cincinnati ohio and chattanooga tennessee and an exclusive operating agreement for   trackage rights over property owned by north carolina railroad company were as follows 

  



  

the following table sets forth certain statistics relating to   our   railroads’ operations for the past 5 years 

  



railway operating revenues   –   total railway operating revenues were 105 billion  in 2015  following is an overview of our three major market groups 

  

coal   – revenues from coal accounted for about 17 of our total railway operating revenues in 2015  we handled 120 million  tons or 11 million  carloads in 2015  most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins with the balance from major western coal basins received via the memphis and chicago gateways our coal franchise supports the electric generation market serving approximately 79 coal generation plants as well as the export metallurgical and industrial markets   primarily through direct rail and river lake and coastal facilities including various terminals on the ohio river   lambert’s   point in norfolk virginia   the port of baltimore and lake erie 

  

see the discussion of coal revenues and tonnage by type of coal in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

general merchandise   –  our general merchandise market group is composed of five major commodity groupings 

 

k  5 

 

in 2015  124 million tons of general merchandise freight or approximately 62 of total general merchandise tonnage we handled originated on our lines the balance of general merchandise freight was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways our principal interchange points for received freight included chicago east st louis new orleans memphis detroit kansas city bellevue meridian buffalo and toledo general merchandise carloads handled in 2015  were 25 million  the revenues from which accounted for 60 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

see the discussion of general merchandise revenues by commodity group in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

intermodal   –  our intermodal market group consists of shipments moving in trailers domestic and international containers and roadrailer® equipment these shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies international steamship lines truckers and other shippers intermodal units handled in 2015  were 39 million the revenues from which accounted for 23 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

see the discussion of intermodal revenues in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

freight rates   –   private contracts and exempt price quotes   are our   predominant pricing mechanisms thus a major portion of our freight business is not economically regulated by the   federal   government in general market forces   are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

in 2015  our railroads were found by the us surface transportation board stb the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices to be “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on results for the year 2014  the stb has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2015    a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement 

  

passenger operations   –   amtrak operates regularly scheduled passenger trains on our lines between the following locations 

   

a consortium of two transportation commissions of the commonwealth of virginia operate commuter trains on our   line between manassas and alexandria 

  

k  6 

we   lease the chicago to manhattan illinois line to the commuter rail division of the regional transportation authority of northeast illinois metra 

  

we   operate freight service over lines with significant ongoing amtrak and commuter passenger operations and conduct   freight operations over trackage owned or leased by 

 

amtrak   and various   commuter agencies conduct passenger operations over trackage owned by conrail in the shared assets areas note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

noncarrier operations   –   our   noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition leasing and management of coal oil gas and minerals the development of commercial real estate telecommunications and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment in 2015  no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment under relevant authoritative accounting guidance 

  

railway property 

  

our   railroad system extends across   22   states and the district of columbia the railroad infrastructure makes   us   capital intensive with net property of approximately 29 billion on a historical cost basis 

property additions   –   property additions for the past five years were as follows including capitalized leases 



our capital spending and replacement programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable rail transportation services for 2016  we   have   budgeted 21   billion of property additions see further discussion of our planned capital spending and replacement programs in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the subheading financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

we have   invested and will continue to invest in various projects and corridor initiatives to expand our   rail network to increase capacity and improve transit times while returning value to shareholders initiatives include the following 

 

k  7 

 

equipment   –   at   december 31 2015  we   owned or leased the following units of equipment

the following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at december 31 2015  

  



the following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at december 31 2015  and   information regarding 2015  retirements 

  



track maintenance   –  of the 36200 total miles of track we operate we are responsible for maintaining 29000 miles with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance 

  

over 82 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard approximately 43 of our lines excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2015  

  

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding   our   track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 



traffic control   –  of the approximately 16800 route miles we dispatch about 11300 miles are signalized including 8500 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 2800 miles of automatic block signals of the 8500 miles of ctc approximately 7600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites 

  

environmental matters   –   compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is   one our   principal goals to date such compliance   has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or competitive position see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 “personal injury environmental and legal liabilities” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

k  9 

employees   –   the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 



more than   80   of our   railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

government regulation   –   in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all business our   railroads are subject to regulation by the stb the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers the federal railroad administration   fra   regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards 

  

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 included exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract about 90 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

efforts   have been made over the past several years   to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry   and such efforts are expected to continue in 2016  the staggers rail act of 1980   substantially balanced   the interests of shippers and rail carriers   and   encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly   we   will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

  

government regulations concerning the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition   –   there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprogress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

our   primary rail competitor is csx   corporation both   railroads   operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory we   also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable   railroads   to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations     we continue to take measures to enhance the security of our rail system our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the 

k  10 

association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

our plan also complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and is integrated into hazardous material training programs additionally locationspecific security plans are in place for certain metropolitan areas and each of the six port facilities we serve with respect to the ports each facilitys security plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and remains subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

  

additionally we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the tsa the federal bureau of investigation fbi the fra the us coast guard us customs and border protection and various state homeland security offices 

similarly we follow guidance from dhs and dot regarding rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 substantially reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest 

in 2015 through participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response transcaer program we provided rail accident response training to approximately 4792 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel our other training efforts throughout 2015 included participation in drills for local state and federal agencies we also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the security and emergency response training course conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado   




 item 1a risk factors 

we are   subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial operating and environmental matters   congress can enact laws that could increase economic regulation of the industry railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the surface transportation board stb which has jurisdiction over some rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and on the efficiency of our operations either of which could result in a material adverse effect in the future on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

  

railroads are also subject to the enactment of laws by congress and regulation by the us department of transportation and the us department of homeland security which regulate most aspects of our operations related to safety and security the rail safety improvement act of 2008 rsia the surface transportation extension act of 2015 and the implementing regulations promulgated by the federal railroad administration fra require us and each other class i railroad to implement an interoperable positive train control system ptc on certain of our respective lines by december 31 2018 

k  11 

full implementation of ptc in compliance with rsia will result in additional operating costs and capital expenditures and ptc implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses and increased claims and litigation costs 

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability   for acts and omissions past present and future   is inherent in the railroad business this risk includes property owned by us whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

as a common carrier by rail   we   must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk  transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property including environmental damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

  

we   may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

  

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

  

we may be affected by general economic conditions   prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

we may be affected by energy prices   volatility in energy prices could have an effect on a variety of items including but not limited to the economy demand for transportation services business related to the energy sector including crude natural gas and coal fuel prices and fuel surcharges any of these items could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

we   may be affected by climate change legislation or regulation concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions moreover even without such legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity 

k  12 

relating to ghgs could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs decrease the amount of traffic handled and decrease the value of coal reserves we own and thus could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter such restrictions could affect our customers that 1 use commodities that we carry to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy 

  

we   face competition from other transportation providers we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and quality and reliability of service while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the operations of carriers with which   we   interchange may adversely affect   our   operations our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

  

we   rely   on technology and technology improvements in   our   business operations if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption a security breach or other operational difficulties additionally if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

the vast majority of   our   employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect   our operations  more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

we   may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded 

  

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages see note 16 to the consolidated financial

statements however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

  

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect   our   operational efficiency and ability to meet demand workforce demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets we consumed approximately 487 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2015 fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter also such an event could impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capital intensive nature as well as the industryspecific requirements of the rail industry high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of locomotives and certain track and rolling stock materials changes in the competitive landscapes of these limitedsupplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

the state of capital markets could adversely affect   our   liquidity from timetotime we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of longterm debt instruments and commercial paper as well as the sale of certain receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial condition alone or in combination could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 20000 miles of road in 22 states and the district of columbia serves every major container port in the eastern united states and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a major transporter of coal automotive and industrial products 

we faced significant headwinds during 2015 as operating revenues were negatively impacted by the steep decline in energy prices which drove both reduced fuel surcharge revenue and volume decreases in coal and energyrelated products despite these challenges we continued our focus on deploying resources to improve network velocity and service while streamlining our corporate assets with the restructuring of our triple crown services company tcs subsidiary and the closure of our roanoke virginia corporate office as a result of operational improvements network fluidity improved throughout the year as evidenced by a 21 decrease in terminal dwell from the beginning of the year and a 17 improvement in train speed over the same time period 

in 2016  we expect to see continued improvement in our service levels and the implementation of multiple costcontrol initiatives as we balance resources with the demand for our highquality rail service through these initiatives we expect to produce expense savings of 130 million in 2016 while increasing productivity and efficiency we also expect to see modest growth in our intermodal and automotive markets which should help temper weakness in our commodityrelated markets however further declines in commodity prices or consumer activity could erode demand average revenue per unit is anticipated to benefit from pricing gains improving our rail service generating higher returns on capital and increasing the efficiency of our resources remain our focus and we believe we are wellpositioned to meet continued headwinds in 2016

net income in 2015  was 16 billion  or 510  per diluted share down   444 million  or 22  compared with 20 billion  or 639  per diluted share in 2014  the decrease in net income for the year reflected lower income from railway operations down 691 million or 19 primarily due to a 11 billion or 10 decline in railway operating revenues as a result of lower average revenue per unit driven primarily by reduced fuel surcharge revenues offset in part by price increases and depressed coal volumes this decline in revenues was partially offset by lower operating expenses down 422 million or 5 resulting from the drop in oil prices which significantly reduced fuel expense for the year and by lower incentive compensation expense these expense reductions were partially offset by 93 million of costs associated with the restructuring of our tcs subsidiary and the closure of our roanoke virginia corporate office which reduced net income by 58 million or 019 per diluted share and by higher wage rates 

2014  compared with 2013   

  

net income in 2014  was 20 billion  or 639  per diluted share up 90 million  or 5  compared with 

19 billion  or 604  per diluted share in 2013  as a 10  increase in income from railway operations was only partially offset by the absence of a gain from a land sale in michigan which benefited net income by 60 million and earnings per share by 019 in 2013 railway operating revenues rose 3  while operating expenses increased 

k  19 

only 1  driven largely by higher volumerelated expenses that were offset in part by lower compensation and benefits costs and fuel prices 

detailed results of operations 

  

railway operating revenues 

  

railway operating revenues were 105 billion  in 2015  116 billion  in 2014  and 112 billion  in 2013  the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes and average revenue per unit by market group 

  



  

revenues decrease d 11 billion  in 2015  and increased 379 million  in 2014  as reflected in the table below the decline in 2015  resulted from lower  average revenue per unit a result of reduced fuel surcharge revenues which were down 852 million or 64 and decreased volumes primarily driven by continued weakness in the coal markets the increase  in 2014  resulted from higher volumes partially offset by lower average revenue per unit as the effects of lower rates and changes in the mix of business more than offset higher fuel surcharges 



  

over 85 of our revenue base is covered by negotiated fuel surcharges and revenues associated with these surcharges totaled 477 million 1329 million and 1254 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively fuel surcharge revenues are typically tied to either west texas intermediate crude oil wti or onhighway diesel ohd although less than half of our revenue base subject to fuel surcharges is tied to ohd because wti price levels were below most of our surcharge trigger points during 2015 ohd accounted for about 85 of our fuel surcharge revenues all of our wtirelated fuel surcharge revenue and about 20 of our ohdrelated fuel 

k  20 

surcharge revenue is on a twomonth lag this twomonth lag increased fuel surcharge revenues by 34 million  and 84 million  in 2015 and 2014  respectively but decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 29 million  in 2013  should the current fuel price environment persist in 2016 we expect fuel surcharge revenue to be lower than 2015 

two of our customers dupont and sunbelt chlor alkali partnership sunbelt filed rate reasonableness complaints before the surface transportation board stb alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable since june 1 2009 in the case of dupont and april 1 2011 in the case of sunbelt we have been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates in 2014 the stb resolved both rate reasonableness complaints in our favor the stb’s findings in the sunbelt case remain subject to technical corrections and requests for reconsideration both cases remain open to possible appeal we believe the estimate of any reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity with regard to rate cases we record adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and estimable 

coal  revenues decrease d 559 million  or 23  compared with 2014  reflecting a 16  decline in carload volume average revenue per unit was down   9  primarily due to reduced fuel surcharge revenues which lowered average revenue per unit by 134 

  

in 2014  coal revenues decreased 161 million  or 6  compared with 2013  reflecting a 5  decrease in carload volume average revenue per unit was down   2  the result of lower pricing mainly export coal and the negative effect of changes in mix 

  

for 2016  coal revenues are expected to decrease primarily due to lower volumes associated with continued weak demand 

coal represented 17  of our revenues in 2015  and 77  of shipments handled originated on our lines as shown in the following table tonnage decreased in all markets 

  



  

utility coal  tonnage was down   14  in 2015  compared with 2014  the decrease primarily resulted from reduced coal burn due to significantly lower natural gas prices which caused utilities to shift from coal to natural gas generation as well as coal plant retirements due to the mercury and air toxics standards implementation and mild weather during the last half of 2015 

utility coal tonnage was down   3  in 2014  as compared with 2013  lower utility coal shipments to our northern region due to market share loss and competition from lower priced natural gas were offset in part by gains in our southern region resulting from strong demand for electric generation and stockpile rebuilding after a harsh winter 

for 2016  we expect utility coal tonnage to decrease as we expect lower demand resulting from high stockpiles due to mild weather and depressed natural gas prices 

k  21 

export coal  tonnage decrease d 30  in 2015  compared with 2014  competition faced by us coal suppliers continued to increase as excess coal supply a strong us dollar and depressed coal prices significantly reduced demand for us export coal volume through norfolk was down 55 million  tons or 33  and volume through baltimore was down 15 million  tons or 23  

  

in 2014  export coal tonnage decrease d 19  compared with 2013 strong competition in the global metallurgical and thermal coal markets resulting from excess coal supply weakening economies in the global market and a strong australian currency advantage significantly reduced demand for us export coal volume through norfolk was down 43 million  tons or 20  and volume through baltimore was down 05 million  tons or 8  other export volume decreased 06 million  tons or 85  

  

for 2016  export coal tonnage is expected to decrease as we expect continued pressure in the overseas coal markets due to oversupply weak seaborne coal prices and a strong us dollar 

  

domestic metallurgical coal  tonnage was down  10 in 2015  compared with 2014  and down 5 in 2014 as compared to 2013 both years reflect volume losses related to plant curtailments and sourcing shifts resulting from steel producers looking for opportunities to reduce costs that were offset in part by market share gains 

for 2016  domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to remain relatively flat as customerspecific gains will be partially offset by volume decreases due to plant curtailments and sourcing shifts as we expect steel producers to continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs 

  

industrial coal  tonnage dropped 5 in 2015  compared with 2014  as a result of natural gas conversions and decreased coal burn 

in 2014  industrial coal tonnage increased 16 compared with 2013  as new business opportunities with existing customers was partially offset by declines in anthracite and petcoke shipments 

  

for 2016  industrial coal tonnage is expected to remain flat due to reduced demand resulting from conversions to natural gas offset by additional business with existing customers 

  

general merchandise  revenues in 2015   decrease d 401 million  or 6  compared with 2014  reflecting a 6  decline in average revenue per unit the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues which reduced average revenue per unit by 185 and offset the effects of higher rates volume was relatively flat year over year 

in   2014  general merchandise revenues increase d 362 million  or 6  compared with 2013  reflecting 5   growth  in carload volume and a 1   improvement  in average revenue per unit that reflected favorable changes in fuel surcharge revenue and in mix 

for 2016  general merchandise revenues are expected to increase primarily due to pricing gains 

chemicals  revenues in 2015   decrease d 6  compared with 2014  reflecting a 10 decrease in revenue per unit driven by reduced fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix resulting from increased shipments of lower rated liquefied petroleum gas which more than offset the effect of higher rates volume grew 5  largely driven by more shipments of liquefied petroleum gas and strong demand for shipments of polypropylene due to lower feedstock prices these volume increases were partially offset by fewer shipments of crude oil from the bakken oil fields 

  

in 2014  chemicals revenues increase d 12  compared with 2013  reflecting volume growth  up 12  largely driven by more shipments of crude oil from the bakken and canadian oil fields and growth in shipments of liquefied petroleum gas in the utica shale region 

for 2016  chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as average revenue per unit is expected to be higher largely the effect of increased volumes of higher rated plastics and pricing gains 

k  22 

agriculture consumer products and government  revenues increased 1 in 2015  compared with 2014  the result of increased ethanol shipments due to higher gasoline consumption offset in part by lower fuel surcharge revenues and fewer revenue shipments of empty rail cars as part of the conclusion of a hopper rebody program 

in 2014 agriculture consumer products and government revenues increase d 2  compared with 2013 as a result of a 2 improvement in volume and a 1   improvement  in average revenue per unit due primarily to higher rates that were slightly offset by a negative change in mix the volume increase  was driven by higher corn shipments due to increased demand for ethanol production partially offset by fewer shipments of fertilizer due to production curtailments 

for 2016 agriculture consumer products and government revenues are expected to increase as we expect average revenue per unit to be higher due to pricing gains we also expect modest volume growth supported by increased shipments of ethanol fertilizer food products and feed products 

metals and construction  revenues fell   17  in 2015  compared with 2014  the decline  resulted from a 10 drop in average revenue per unit largely the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues partially offset by pricing gains and a 7 decrease in carloads the decline in carloads was the result of lower demand for materials used in the construction of pipe for drilling activity due to a drop in energy prices fewer shipments of fractionating sand and ceramic proppant used in natural gas drilling and declines in scrap metal and coil shipments resulting from a decline in steel production due to global oversupply these decreases were offset in part by increased shipments of aggregates as a result of higher demand in the southeast for project work and strong highway and construction related markets 

  

in 2014  metals and construction revenues grew   8  compared with 2013  the revenue improvement  resulted from a 9 increase in carloads as we moved more shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling in addition to higher coil shipments to support growing demand in the automotive and energy sectors and increased shipments of iron and steel as a result of higher import activity 

  

for 2016 metals and construction revenues are expected to benefit from increased average revenue per unit due to pricing gains we expect volumes to be relatively flat as constructionrelated gains are expected to be offset by declines in the steel market 

automotive revenues   fell   3  compared to 2014  reflecting an 8 drop in average revenue per unit due primarily to lower fuel surcharge revenues offset in part by rate increases volume grew 5  due to increased production of north american light vehicles and the return of shipments diverted in 2014 due to improved service in the second half of 2015 

in 2014  automotive revenues rose   2  compared to 2013  reflecting 2  growth in volume due to increased vehicle production at plants we serve that was offset in part by the diversion of shipments to other modes of transportation as a result of equipment shortages and network delays 

  

for 2016  automotive revenues are expected to increase as a result of volume gains due to continued increases in domestic production as well as higher average revenue per unit as a result of improved pricing 

paper clay and forest products  revenues were down 3 as average revenue per unit decreased 2 and volumes fell 1 the decline in average revenue per unit was driven primarily by lower fuel surcharge revenues and negative mix fewer higher rated kaolin shipments offset by pricing gains volume changes reflected lower waste kaolin woodchip and graphic paper volumes as a result of customer sourcing changes softened demand and mill closures offset by higher carloads of pulpboard lumber and pulp due to continued recovery of the housing market 

in 2014  paper clay and forest products revenues were flat compared with 2013  as a 2 improvement  in average revenue per unit reflecting pricing gains and positive mix was offset by a 2 decrease in volumes volume declines were driven by reduced shipments of municipal solid waste resulting from loss of business lower 

k  23 

shipments of newsprint and paper due to mill and plant closures and fewer pulp shipments due to production issues and reduced export demand these declines were offset in part by higher lumber shipments resulting from the continued housing recovery and new business 

for 2016  paper clay and forest products revenues are anticipated to increase due to modest improvement in volumes and revenue per unit volume growth is expected to be driven by higher woodchip and lumber shipments as we anticipate growth in demand for wood pellets and the continued recovery of the housing market offset in part by lower municipal solid waste due to the loss of a customer and lower kaolin and graphic paper shipments due to demand declines 

intermodal  revenues decreased 153 million or 6 compared with 2014  reflecting decreased revenue per unit of 6 the result of lower fuel surcharge revenues which decreased average revenue per unit by 51 

  

domestic volume including truckload and intermodal marketing companies tcs and premium business declined 3  a result of the restructuring of the tcs subsidiary ongoing service challenges during the first three quarters an increase in available trucking capacity and weaker overall demand all partially offset by growth from continued highwaytorail conversions international volume grew 6  due to stronger demand from existing customers and new business 

  

in 2014  intermodal revenues increased 178 million  or 7  compared with 2013  reflecting a 8  growth in volume domestic volume improved 6  a result of growth in strategic corridors continued highwaytorail conversions and higher demand for rail service from existing customers international volume grew 10  due to increased demand from existing customers and expanded service opportunities 

  

for 2016 we anticipate higher intermodal revenues due to increased volumes as a result of continued highway conversions and growth associated with new and existing customers to be partially offset by declines due to the restructuring of the tcs subsidiary and an increase in available trucking capacity average revenue per unit is expected to be lower as pricing gains are offset by unfavorable changes in business mix primarily a result of the tcs restructuring and reduced fuel surcharge revenue 

in connection with the tcs restructuring discussed above we are working with our customers and business partners to convert business handled by tcs into our current intermodal network as this transition occurs we expect some shipments previously handled by tcs to be absorbed by our domestic container line of business while it is likely that not all of this tcs business will make this transition we do not expect this restructuring to have a material effect on our railway operating revenues or income from railway operations 

railway operating expenses 

  

railway operating expenses in 2015  were 76 billion  down 422 million or 5 compared to 2014  expenses in 2014  were 80 billion  up 61 million  or 1  compared to 2013  in 2015  decreases in fuel costs and incentive compensation were offset in part by costs associated with the tcs restructuring and closure of our roanoke virginia corporate office in addition to higher wage rates in 2014  increases in volumerelated costs were offset in part by lower postretirement and pension benefit costs as well as lower fuel prices 

k  24 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

  



fuel  expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations decreased 640 million or 41 in 2015 and decreased 39 million or 2 in 2014 both declines were principally the result of lower locomotive fuel prices down 40 in 2015 and 6 in 2014 locomotive fuel consumption decreased 1 in 2015 but increased 4 in 2014 we consumed approximately 487 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2015 compared with 494 million gallons in 2014 and 476 million gallons in 2013 

looking forward to 2016 we expect lower fuel expenses as current prices for locomotive fuel are significantly below the average cost per gallon of 174 experienced in 2015 in addition we anticipate the tcs restructuring and improved fuel productivity will benefit fuel expense in 2016 

compensation and benefits  which represents 38 of total operating expenses increased 14 million in 2015  reflecting changes in 

 

in 2014  compensation and benefits decreased 105 million or 3 reflecting changes in 

 

our employment averaged 30456 in 2015  compared with 29482 in 2014  and 30103 in 2013  looking forward to 2016 we expect normalized levels of incentive compensation in addition to increased medical cost inflation and higher wages to be offset in part by lower employment levels driven from operational efficiencies and the tcs restructuring 

k  25 

materials and other  expenses increased 36 million  or 4 in 2015 and increased 112 million  or 14 in 2014 as shown in the following table 

  

  

the increase in other costs in 2015 reflected higher relocation costs driven by the roanoke virginia corporate office closure increased travel costs for train service employees and higher property taxes casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury pi property damage and environmental matters the increase in 2015 was driven by less favorable pi reserve adjustments for prior years claim amounts offset in part by reduced environmental remediation costs as a result of less unfavorable development for our environmental liability 

volume growth in 2014 drove increases in locomotive and equipment maintenance and repair costs additionally harsh winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014 resulted in increased maintenance activity which negatively impacted the comparison to 2013 the increase in casualties and other claims expenses in 2014 reflected lower favorable pi reserve adjustments for prior years claim amounts 

purchased services and rents  includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses increased 65 million or 4 in 2015 and increased 58 million or 4 in 2014 

  



  

the increase in 2015 for purchased services expense reflects higher costs associated with intermodal operations information technology maintenance and repair and the roanoke virginia corporate office closure these increases were partially offset by tcs restructuringrelated savings the increase in 2014 for purchased services expense resulted from higher volumes and the effect reduced network velocity had on intermodal operations and joint facilities costs additionally higher maintenance and repair costs were offset in part by reduced expenses associated with the shared asset areas including equity in the earnings of conrail see note 5 

equipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment increased in 2015 principally due to higher automotive and intermodal rates and volumes the 2014 increase is a result of higher volumes and network congestion 

k  26 

looking forward to 2016 we expect decreases in our purchased services and equipment rents expenses principally due to lower tcs operational costs and improved network velocity these decreases will be partially offset by higher intermodal operations costs associated with higher conventional volumes 

depreciation  expense increased by 103 million or 11 in 2015 and increased by 35 million or 4 in 2014 the increase in 2015 is due in part to the recognition of 63 million of accelerated depreciation on tcs assets as a result of our tcs restructuring both periods also reflect growth in our roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock 

other income – net 

  

other income – net was 103 million in 2015 104 million in 2014 and 233 million in 2013 note 2 the decrease in 2015 reflects decreased returns from corporateowned life insurance declines in coal royalties and higher professional and consultant fees offset in part from higher gains from sales of property including income earned from joint ventures the decrease in 2014 reflects the absence of the 2013 michigan land sale 97 million 

  

income taxes 

  

income tax expense in 2015 was 886 million an effective rate of 363 compared with 362 in 2014 and 356 in 2013 all three years benefited from favorable reductions in deferred tax expense for state law changes and certain business tax credits 

irs examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2013 we are not currently under audit by the internal revenue service 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities  our principal source of liquidity was 29 billion  in 2015 and 2014  and 31 billion  in 2013  lower cash from operations in 2015 compared with 2014 was offset by reduced tax payments the decrease in 2014 reflected increased tax payments offset in part by improved operating results we had working capital of 402 million at december 31 2015  compared with 998 million at december 31 2014  primarily reflecting higher current maturities of longterm debt cash and cash equivalents totaled 11 billion  and 973 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and were invested in accordance with our corporate investment policy as approved by the board of directors the portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk there are no limits or restrictions on our access to these assets we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations 

k  27 

contractual obligations at december 31 2015  were comprised of interest on fixedrate longterm debt and capital leases longterm debt and capital leases note 8 operating leases note 9 agreements with consolidated rail corporation crc note 5 unconditional purchase obligations note 16 longterm advances from conrail note 5 and unrecognized tax benefits note 3 

  



  

 when the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period when the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the other column 

  

off balance sheet arrangements  consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9 

  

cash used in investing activities  was 21 billion  in 2015  compared with 20 billion  in 2014  and 19 billion  in 2013  the increase in 2015 primarily reflected higher cash outflows for property additions which were partially offset by higher proceeds from coli activity the increase in 2014 primarily reflected increased use of cash for property additions and coli investments which were partially offset by higher shortterm investment maturities 

on september 18 2015 we completed the acquisition of 282 miles of the delaware and hudson railway co dh line between sunbury pennsylvania and schenectady new york for 215 million the transaction is included in property additions on the statement of cash flows the acquisition comprises land 49 million roadway including bridges tunnels grading rail cross ties and other track material 162 million and other property including supplies 4 million the acquired lines connect with our network at sunbury pennsylvania and binghamton new york and provide us singleline routes from chicago and the southeastern united states to albany new york and our intermodal terminals in scranton pennsylvania and mechanicville new york we also gain an enhanced connection to our pan am southern llc joint venture which serves new england markets we previously provided service over the dh lines via trackage rights and haulage agreements in addition we hired trained and qualified 152 former dh employees 

k  28 

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 



  



  



  

for 2016  we have budgeted 21 billion for property additions the anticipated spending includes 820 million for the normalized replacement of rail ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges planned equipment spending of 490 million includes new and rebuilt locomotives intermodal containers and chassis mill gondolas multilevel automobile racks and covered hoppers investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be 220 million and include terminals and equipment to add capacity to our intermodal network new or expanded bulk transfer facilities improvements to vehicle distribution facilities and upgrades and expansions of our mechanical service shops for 2016 we have budgeted 250 million for the continued implementation of positive train control ptc and expect ptcrelated property additions in 2017 and 2018 to total approximately 530 million we also expect to spend 90 million on infrastructure improvements to increase mainline capacity create operating savings and to accommodate business growth technology investments of 80 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers 

cash used in financing activities  was 662 million  in 2015  compared with 13 billion  in 2014  and 394 million  in 2013  the decrease in 2015 was driven primarily by higher proceeds from borrowing and lower debt repayments partially offset by higher share repurchase activity see note 14 the increase in 2014 was driven primarily by higher debt repayments and lower debt proceeds partially offset by reduced share repurchase activity 

k  29 

share repurchases totaled 11 billion  in 2015  318 million  in 2014  and 627 million  in 2013  for the purchase and retirement of 113 million  31 million  and 83 million  shares respectively on august 1 2012 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock through december 31 2017 and 239 million shares remain under this authority as of december 31 2015  the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash cash on hand or proceeds from borrowings 

  

we further discuss our current securities issuance authority from our board of directors our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 8 of our notes to consolidated financial statements all of which provide for access to additional liquidity should the need arise our debttototal capitalization ratio was 453 at december 31 2015  compared with 420 at december 31 2014  

  

upcoming annual debt maturities are relatively modest note 8 overall our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we regularly discuss the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities 

  

net pension expense which is included in “compensation and benefits” in the consolidated statements of income was 34 million  for 2015  in recording this amount we assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 825  which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception as well as our expectation of future returns a onepercentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 20 million  change in pension expense we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using discount rates that are based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans 

  

k  30 

net benefit for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was 15 million for 2015  historically medical inflation has been a significant component of the estimate for postretirement benefits however its effect has been reduced substantially due to the plan amendment made in 2014 note 11 since there is a fixed benefit for medicareeligible retirees there is no medical inflation assumed for this population the medical inflation factor is still applicable for premedicareeligible retirees 

  

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our total assets are longlived railway properties note 6 as disclosed in note 1 properties are depreciated using group depreciation the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area 

  

depreciation expense for 2015  totaled 1054 million  our composite depreciation rates for 2015  are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 38 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense for 2015  roadway depreciation rates ranged from 083  to 3333 and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 155  to 3333  

  

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

  

casualties and other claims expense included in “materials and other” in the consolidated statements of income consists primarily of our accrual for personal injury liabilities and environmental remediation costs 

  

to aid in valuing our personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study our estimate is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the ultimate loss sustained may vary from the estimated liability recorded 

  

we are subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations we record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates additionally our environmental policy council composed of senior managers oversees and interprets our environmental policy operating expenses included in materials and other and purchased services and rents for environmental matters totaled 40 million in 2015  45 million in 2014  and 57 million in 2013  and property additions for environmental matters were not significant 

we andor certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to earnings 

for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury and environmental matters see note 16 

income taxes 

  

our net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 91 billion  at december 31 2015  note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required

with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we had a 35 million  valuation allowance on 603 million  of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2015  reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized 

  

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we believe this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded for every one half percent change in the 2015  effective tax rate net income would have changed by 12 million 

  

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

  

more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions pursuant to the railway labor act these agreements remain in effect until new agreements are reached or until the bargaining procedures mandated by the act are completed we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee nccc moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements 

on or after november 1 2014 the nccc and the various unions exchanged new proposals to begin this round of national negotiations   the unions have formed three separate bargaining coalitions   and negotiations are ongoing with all three coalitions in the case of the transportation communications union led coalition the negotiations are being assisted by mediators from the national mediation board separately in january 2015 we reached an agreement covering wages and work rules through 2019 with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet which represents approximately 4600 of our locomotive engineers changes to the blet benefit plan will be bargained nationally through the nccc 

  

market risks 

  

we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments at december 31 2015  debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 200 million a onepercentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately 2 million we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in longlived assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost

internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data we recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

  

in order to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective we regularly assess such controls and did so most recently for our financial reporting at december 31 2015  this assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework   2013  based on our assessment we have concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2015  

  

our board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies financial reporting and internal control the audit committee of our board of directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management the independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee 

  

we have issued a report of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2015  these reports appear in part ii item 8 of this report on form 10k

see the discussion of intermodal revenues in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

freight rates   –   private contracts and exempt price quotes   are our   predominant pricing mechanisms thus a major portion of our freight business is not economically regulated by the   federal   government in general market forces   are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

in 2014  our railroads were found by the us surface transportation board stb the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices to be “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on results for the year 

k  6 

2013  the stb has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2014    a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement

track maintenance   –  of the 35900 total miles of track we operate we are responsible for maintaining 28750 miles with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance 

  

over 82 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard approximately 45 of our lines excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2014

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding   our   track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 



microwave system   –  our microwave system consisting of approximately 6983 radio route miles 423 core stations 30 secondary stations and 5 passive repeater stations provides communications between most operating locations we use the microwave system primarily for voice communications vhf radio control circuits data and facsimile transmissions traffic control operations and aei data transmissions 

  

traffic control   –  of the approximately 16500 route miles we dispatch about 11025 miles are signalized including 8250 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 2775 miles of automatic block signals of the 8250 miles of ctc approximately 7447 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 345 base station radio sites 

  

computers   –   a computer network consisting of a centralized production and backup data center and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards terminals transportation offices rolling stock repair points sales offices and other key system locations operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data in addition   our   computer systems assist   us   in the performance of a variety of functions and services   including payroll car and revenue accounting billing   sourcing inventory   management activities and controls and special studies 

environmental matters   –   compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is   one our   principal goals to date such compliance   has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations liquidity or competitive position see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 “personal injury environmental and legal liabilities” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

employees   –   the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 

  



more than   80   of our   railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

government regulation   –   in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all business our   railroads are subject to regulation by the stb the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers the federal railroad administration   fra   regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards 

  

k  11 

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 included exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from regulation for the duration of the contract about 90 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

efforts   have been made over the past several years   to resubject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation   and such efforts are expected to continue in 2015  the staggers rail act of 1980   substantially balanced   the interests of shippers and rail carriers   and   encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly   we   will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

  

government regulations concerning the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition   –   there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprogress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

our   primary rail competitor is csx   corporation both   railroads   operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory we   also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable   railroads   to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations     we continue to take measures to enhance the security of our rail system our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

our plan also complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and is integrated into hazardous material training programs additionally locationspecific security plans are in place for certain metropolitan areas and each of the six port facilities we serve with respect to the ports each facility plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and remains subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

  

additionally we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the tsa the federal bureau of investigation fbi the fra the us coast guard us customs and border protection and various state homeland security offices 

k  12 

similarly we follow guidance from dhs and dot regarding rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 substantially reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest 

in 2014 through participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response transcaer program we provided rail accident response training to approximately 5442 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel our other training efforts throughout 2014 included participation in drills for local state and federal agencies we also have ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the security and emergency response training course conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado   




 item 1a risk factors 

  

we are   subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial operating and environmental matters   railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the surface transportation board stb which has jurisdiction over some rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

  

railroads are subject to safety and security regulation by the us department of transportation and the us department of homeland security which regulate most aspects of our operations compliance with the rail safety improvement act of 2008 will result in additional operating costs associated with the statutorily mandated implementation of positive train control by 2015 in addition to increased capital expenditures implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses and increased claims and litigation costs 

  

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability –  for acts and omissions past present and future –  is inherent in the railroad business this risk includes property owned by us whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

as a common carrier by rail   we   must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk  transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property including environmental damage and compromise critical parts of our rail network a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of

we   may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

  

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

  

we may be affected by general economic conditions   prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter

we   may be affected by climate change legislation or regulation concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions moreover even without such legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs decrease the amount of traffic handled and decrease the value of coal reserves we own and thus could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter such restrictions could affect our customers that 1 use commodities that we carry to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy 

  

we   face competition from other transportation providers we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and quality and reliability of service while we have used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the operations of carriers with which   we   interchange may adversely affect   our   operations our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in 

k  14 

our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

  

we   rely   on technology and technology improvements in   our   business operations if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption a security breach or other operational difficulties additionally if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

the vast majority of   our   employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect   our operations  more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

we   may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect   our   operational efficiency and ability to meet demand workforce demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets we consumed 494 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2014 fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in existing or emerging

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 20000 miles of road in 22 states and the district of columbia serves every major container port in the eastern united states and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a major transporter of coal automotive and industrial products 

  

strong volume growth in our intermodal and merchandise businesses driven by higher demand for rail services offset declines in our coal business resulting in a 379 million or 3 improvement in our operating revenues our continued focus on cost control helped stem growth in operating expenses up 61 million or 1 despite higher volumes and led to an alltime low operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses of 692 for 2014 

the unexpected volume growth and severe winter weather led to resource shortages and network delays during the year we are committed to improving our service and have added resources to meet the needs of our network as a result of these efforts in the latter part of the year we saw improvement in operational metrics and expect this to continue in 2015 

looking forward to 2015  we expect the impact of lower oil prices on our fuel surcharge revenue programs to be offset by increased volumes and higher rates we will continue to focus on safety service levels cost control productivity operational efficiency and a marketbased approach to pricing 

  

summarized results of operations 

  

2014  compared with 2013   

  

net income in 2014  was 20 billion  or 639  per diluted share up   90 million  or 5  compared with 19 billion  or 604  per diluted share in 2013  as a 10   increase  in income from railway operations was only partially offset by the absence of a gain from a land sale in michigan which benefited net income by 60 million and earnings per share by 019 in 2013 railway operating revenues rose   3  while operating expenses increased   only   1  driven largely by higher volumerelated expenses that were offset in part by lower compensation and benefits costs and fuel prices 

  

  2013  compared with 2012   

  

net income in 2013  was 19 billion  or 604  per diluted share up 161 million  or 9  compared with 

17 billion  or 537  per diluted share in 2012  a reflection of a 4  increase in income from railway operations in addition to the favorable impact of the recognition of the gain from a land sale in michigan see above railway operating revenues rose 2  while operating expenses increased 1  driven largely by higher volumerelated expenses 

k  21 

detailed results of operations 

  

railway operating revenues 

  

railway operating revenues were 116 billion  in 2014  112 billion  in 2013  and 110 billion  in 2012  the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes and average revenue per unit by market group 

  



  

revenues increase d 379 million  in 2014  and 205 million  in 2013  as reflected in the table below the increase  in 2014  resulted from higher  volumes partially offset by lower  average revenue per unit as the effects of lower rates and changes in the mix of business more than offset higher fuel surcharges the increase  in 2013  resulted from higher  volumes partially offset by lower  average revenue per unit as lower marketbased export coal rates the effects of changes in the mix of business and slightly lower fuel surcharges more than offset rate increases 



  

over 85 of our revenue base is covered by negotiated fuel surcharges and revenues in 2014 included 1329 million of such surcharges this amount was divided about evenly between surcharges tied to the monthly average price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti and surcharges tied to the weekly average price of onhighway diesel ohd more than twothirds of the 2014 wtibased surcharges were attributable to contracts with trigger prices above current wti levels of about 50 per barrel a predominant trigger price is 64 per barrel therefore if wti prices remain below these triggers traffic moving under these contracts will not be assessed any fuel surcharge almost all of the remaining wtibased surcharges have trigger prices well below current wti levels and almost all of the ohdbased surcharges have trigger prices substantially below current ohd levels of about 3 per gallon as a result if wti and ohd prices remain at their current levels traffic moving under these 

k  22 

contracts will continue to be assessed fuel surcharges however they will be substantially lower than those generated in 2014 thus total fuel surcharges for 2015 could be less than half of the amount in 2014 the wtirelated surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the wti average price for the second preceding calendar month this twomonth lag in applying the wti average price increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 84 million  in 2014  decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 29 million  in 2013  and increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 39 million  in 2012  fuel surcharge revenue totaled 1254 million  in 2013  and 1278 million  in 2012  

two of our customers dupont and sunbelt chlor alkai partnership sunbelt filed rate reasonableness complaints before the surface transportation board stb alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable since june 1 2009 in the case of dupont and april 1 2011 in the case of sunbelt we have been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates on march 14 2014 the stb resolved dupont’s rate reasonableness complaint in our favor and on june 20 2014 the stb resolved sunbelt’s rate case in our favor the stb’s findings in both cases remain subject to technical corrections requests for reconsideration and appeal we believe the estimate of any reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity with regard to rate cases we record adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and estimable 

coal  revenues decrease d 161 million  or 6  compared with 2013  reflecting a 5   decrease  in carload volume average revenue per unit was down   2  the result of lower pricing mainly marketbased export coal and the negative effect of changes in mix 

  

in 2013  coal revenues decreased 336 million  or 12  compared with 2012  reflecting a 5  decrease in carload volume tonnage hauled decline d 4  average revenue per unit was down   7  the result of lower pricing mainly marketbased export coal and decreased fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by the positive effect of changes in mix 

  

for 2015  coal revenues are expected to decrease due to lower average revenue per unit largely a result of lower fuel surcharge revenue and decreased volumes 

coal represented 21  of our revenues in 2014  and 79  of shipments handled originated on our lines as shown in the following table tonnage decreased in our export utility and domestic metallurgical markets but increased in our industrial markets 

  



  

utility coal  tonnage was down   3  in 2014  compared with 2013  lower utility coal shipments to our northern region due to market share loss and competition from lower priced natural gas were offset in part by gains in our southern region resulting from strong demand for electric generation and stockpile rebuilding after a harsh winter 

utility coal tonnage was down   4  in 2013  as compared to 2012  utility coal shipments in our southern region decreased due to lower demand as utility stockpiles remained high and natural gas prices remained low this 

k  23 

decrease was partially offset by increased shipments in our northern region as higher coal burn necessitated stockpile replenishments to maintain targeted levels 

for 2015  we expect utility coal tonnage to decrease as we expect lower demand resulting from a decline in natural gas prices and reduced coal burn at southern utilities we serve 

  

export coal  tonnage decrease d 19  in 2014  compared with 2013  strong competition in the global metallurgical and thermal coal markets resulting from excess coal supply weakening economies in the global market and a strong australian currency advantage significantly reduced demand for us export coal volume through norfolk was down 43 million  tons or 20  and volume through baltimore was down 05 million  tons or 8  other export volume decreased 06 million  tons or 85  

  

in 2013  export coal tonnage increase d 1  compared with 2012 despite strong global competition we handled higher export thermal and metallurgical coal shipments as an increase in steel production in developing markets offset weakness in the european market volume through norfolk was up 21 million  tons or 11  whereas baltimore volume decreased 14 million  tons or 17  other export volume decreased 04 million  tons or 36  

  

for 2015  export coal tonnage is expected to decrease as a result of strong competition in the overseas metallurgical coal market in addition to soft demand for and an oversupply of thermal coal 

  

domestic metallurgical coal  tonnage was down  5 in 2014  compared with 2013  as lower metallurgical coal shipments resulting from plant curtailments and customer sourcing shifts were offset in part by higher shipments of coke 

in 2013  domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was down  10 compared with 2012  due to weaker domestic steel production sourcing shifts away from coal origins we serve and the permanent closure of a steel plant in mid2012 that impacted the yearoveryear comparison for the first half of 2013 

  

for 2015  domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to decline due to closure of a mine that we currently serve 

  

industrial coal  tonnage increased 16 in 2014  compared with 2013  as new business opportunities with existing customers was partially offset by declines in anthracite and petcoke shipments 

in 2013  industrial coal tonnage increased slightly compared with 2012  as increased shipments to existing customers were partially offset by weaker industrial demand in the print paper and cement sectors 

  

for 2015  industrial coal tonnage is expected to decrease primarily due to conversions to natural gas 

  

general merchandise  revenues in 2014   increase d 362 million  or 6  compared with 2013  reflecting 5   growth  in carload volume and a 1   improvement  in average revenue per unit that reflected favorable changes in fuel surcharge revenue and in mix 

in   2013  general merchandise revenues increase d 398 million  or 7  compared with 2012  reflecting 4   growth  in carload volume and a 3   improvement  in average revenue per unit that reflected favorable changes in mix as well as higher rates and fuel surcharges 

chemicals  revenues in 2014   increase d 12  compared with 2013  reflecting volume growth  up   12  largely driven by higher shipments of crude oil originated from the bakken and canadian oil fields and growth in shipments of liquefied petroleum gas in the utica shale region 

  

k  24 

in 2013  chemicals revenues increase d 14  compared with 2012  reflecting 16   growth  in volume partially offset by a 2   decline  in average revenue per unit that resulted from the negative effect of the changes in mix due to increased crude oil shipments the volume improvement  was primarily the result of more carloads of crude oil from the bakken and canadian oil fields additionally there were more carloads of liquefied petroleum gas in the utica shale region 

for 2015  chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as we expect more shipments of crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas however a prolonged period of low oil prices could put pressure on demand for crude by rail average revenue per unit is expected to be lower largely a result of the anticipated reduction in fuel surcharge revenue and the negative mix effect of the volume increase in lowerrated shipments 

  

metals and construction  revenues grew   8  in 2014  compared with 2013  the revenue improvement  resulted from a 9 increase in carloads as we moved more shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling in addition to higher coil shipments to support growing demand in the automotive and energy sectors and increased shipments of iron and steel as a result of higher import activity 

  

in 2013  metals and construction revenues increase d 5  compared with 2012  the improvement  resulted from 6   higher  average revenue per unit which reflected the positive change in mix of business as we transported higherrated shipments of slag and fractionating sand for natural gas drilling higher rates and increased fuel surcharges although we moved more slag and fractionating carloads volume decline d modestly as we handled reduced shipments of iron and steel driven by fewer import slabs and a steel plant closure during the third quarter of 2012 and scrap metal a result of weakening demand 

for 2015  metals and construction revenues are expected to decline reflecting lower average revenue per unit as a result of the anticipated decline in fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by improved volumes we currently anticipate higher shipments of fractionating sand and other materials used for natural gas drilling as well as additional shipments of aggregates due to growth in road construction activity and steel used by the automotive and energy sectors 

agriculture consumer products and government  revenues increase d 2  in 2014  compared with 2013  as a result of a 2 improvement in volume and a 1   improvement  in average revenue per unit due primarily to higher rates that were slightly offset by a negative change in mix the volume increase  was driven by higher corn shipments due to increased demand for ethanol production partially offset by fewer shipments of fertilizer due to production curtailments 

in 2013 agriculture consumer products and government revenues increase d 1  compared with 2012 as a 2   improvement  in average revenue per unit reflecting pricing improvements that were slightly offset by a negative change in mix related to the increase of lowerrated shorterhaul movements of corn was partially offset by a slight decrease  in volume the volume decrease  was driven by reduced shipments of soybeans and related products caused by tightened supplies of domestic beans and a strong south american crop in addition to fewer revenue movements of empty equipment carload volume declines were partially offset by higher shipments of food oils as we handled new business with existing customers and more biodiesel carloads in advance of the anticipated elimination of the biodiesel tax credit we also hauled more shipments of fertilizer due to a strong farm economy and increased planting activity 

for 2015  agriculture consumer products and government revenues are expected to be flat as we expect higher volumes will be offset by lower average revenue per unit reflecting lower fuel surcharges offset in part by pricing gains volume growth is anticipated to come from higher shipments of soybeans as we return to a more normal crop cycle more carloads of ethanol and growth in feed product shipments as a result of increased export opportunities 

k  25 

automotive revenues   rose   2  compared to 2013  reflecting 2  growth in volume due to increased vehicle production at plants we serve that was offset in part by the diversion of shipments to other modes of transportation as a result of equipment shortages and network delays 

in 2013  automotive revenues rose   10  compared to 2012  reflecting 7  growth in volume due to increased vehicle production at plants we serve and new business from existing customers including both auto parts and finished vehicles average revenue per unit improved 2  reflecting improved pricing and higher fuel surcharges 

  

for 2015  automotive revenues are expected to slightly decrease as a result of lower average revenue per unit as lower fuel surcharges are expected to offset improved pricing these average revenue per unit declines are expected to be partially offset by volume gains driven by a continued increase in domestic production at plants we serve and the return of diverted traffic 

  

paper clay and forest products  revenues were flat as a 2 improvement  in average revenue per unit reflecting pricing gains and positive mix was offset by a 2  decrease in volumes volume declines were driven by reduced shipments of municipal solid waste resulting from loss of business lower shipments of newsprint and paper due to mill and plant closures and fewer pulp shipments due to production issues and reduced export demand these declines were offset in part by higher lumber shipments resulting from the continued housing recovery and new business 

in 2013  paper clay and forest products revenues increased 3  compared with 2012  reflecting 1  gains in both volume and average revenue per unit volume increases for lumber pulp and pulpboard were offset by reduced demand for newsprint and paper 

for 2015  paper clay and forest products revenues are anticipated to decline reflecting lower fuel surcharge revenue and a negative mix of business offset in part by slightly higher volumes volume growth is expected to be driven by higher woodchip wood pellet lumber and pulp shipments as we anticipate the continued recovery of the housing market to increase demand offset in part by lower municipal solid waste loss of a customer and newsprint and paper shipments as demand declines 

intermodal  revenues increased 178 million or 7 compared with 2013  reflecting an 8 growth in volume 

  

domestic volume including truckload and intermodal marketing companies triple crown services and premium business improved 6  a result of growth in strategic corridors continued highwaytorail conversions and higher demand for rail service from existing customers international volume grew 10  due to increased demand from existing customers and expanded service opportunities 

  

in 2013  intermodal revenues increased 143 million  or 6  compared with 2012  reflecting a 6  growth in volume average revenue per unit was flat domestic volume improved 7  the result of continued highwaytorail conversions and additional business associated with the opening of new intermodal terminals international volume grew 6  due to growth with existing customers as well as new service lanes 

  

for 2015  we anticipate higher intermodal revenues due to increased volumes as a result of continued highway conversions and growth associated with new and existing customers average revenue per unit is expected to be lower as pricing gains are offset by reduced fuel surcharge revenue 

railway operating expenses 

  

railway operating expenses in 2014  were 80 billion  up 61 million or 1 compared to 2013  expenses in 2013  were 80 billion  up 72 million  or 1  compared to 2012  in 2014  increases in volumerelated costs were offset in part by lower postretirement and pension benefit costs as well as lower fuel prices for 2013  higher wage rates and volumerelated expense increases were offset in part by lower costs resulting from network efficiencies 

k  26 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

  



materials and other  expenses increased 112 million or 14 in 2014 but decreased 31 million or 4 in 2013 as shown in the following table 

  



  

volume growth in 2014 and 2013 drove increases in locomotive and equipment maintenance and repair costs for both years additionally the harsh winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2014 resulted in increased maintenance activity which negatively impacted the yearoveryear comparison casualties and other claims expenses include the estimates of costs related to personal injury pi property damage and environmental matters the increase in expense in 2014 reflected lower favorable pi reserve adjustments for prior years claim amounts than those seen in 2013 which were driven by improved historical trend rates related to pi liabilities 

  

we maintain substantial amounts of insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims we also retain reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance for further discussion of casualty claims and insurance see note 16 

k  27 

purchased services and rents  includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses increased 58 million or 4 in 2014 and 25 million or 2 in 2013 

  



  

the increase in 2014 for purchased services expense reflected the impact of higher volumes and reduced network velocity on intermodal operations and joint facilities costs additionally higher maintenance and repair costs were offset in part by reduced expenses associated with the shared asset areas including equity in the earnings of conrail see note 5 the increase in 2013 reflected higher volumerelated activities and software expenses partially offset by lower professional and consulting fees and travel expenses 

equipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment increased in 2014 as a result of higher volumes and network congestion but decreased in 2013 as a result of increased velocity and improved equipment utilization 

depreciation  expense increased by 35 million or 4 in 2014 and was flat in 2013 both periods reflected our larger roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock in 2013 that increase was completely offset by the favorable impact of an equipment depreciation study that was completed during the first quarter of 2013 

fuel  expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations decreased 39 million or 2 in 2014 but increased 36 million or 2 in 2013 the decrease in 2014 was principally the result of lower locomotive fuel prices down 6 offset in part by higher locomotive fuel consumption up 4 the increase in 2013 reflected higher locomotive fuel consumption up 4 offset in part by lower locomotive fuel prices down 2 we consumed approximately 494 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2014 compared with 476 million gallons in 2013 should fuel prices remain at current levels we would expect to see a significant savings in fuel expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014 

compensation and benefits  which represents 36 of total operating expenses decreased 105 million or 3 in 2014  reflecting changes in 

 

in 2013  compensation and benefits increased 42 million  or 1  over 2012  reflecting changes in 

 

our employment averaged 29482 in 2014  compared with 30103 in 2013  and 30943 in 2012  looking forward to 2015 we expect employment levels to be higher than 2014 as we continue to add resources to our network

other income – net 

  

other income – net was 104 million in 2014 233 million in 2013 and 129 million in 2012 note 2 both comparisons reflect the michigan land sale 97 million that occurred in 2013 

  

income taxes 

  

income tax expense in 2014 was 11 billion an effective rate of 362 compared with 356 in 2013 and 366 in 2012 the 2014 and 2013 years benefited from favorable reductions in deferred tax expense for state law changes and certain business tax credits 

the tax increase prevention act of 2014 2014 act enacted on december 19 2014 extended for the year 2014 fiftypercent bonus depreciation and certain business tax credits that benefit us while bonus depreciation does not affect our total provision for income taxes or effective rate the absence of bonus depreciation will increase current income tax expense and the related cash outflows for the payment of income taxes the effect of this tax legislation will be seen as a reduction in our 2015 cash outflows for income taxes as our required yearend estimated tax payment was due and paid before the 2014 act was enacted 

irs examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2011 our consolidated federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012 are currently being audited by the irs we anticipate that the irs will complete its examination in 2015 we do not expect that the resolution of the examination will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities  our principal source of liquidity was 29 billion  in 2014 and 31 billion  in both 2013  and 2012  the decrease in 2014 reflected increased tax payments see above offset in part by improved operating results we had working capital of 998 million at december 31 2014  compared with 770 million at december 31 2013  primarily reflecting reduced current maturities of longterm debt cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances totaled 973 million and 16 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively and were invested in accordance with our corporate investment policy as approved by the board of directors the portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk there are no limits or restrictions on our access to these assets we expect cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations 

k  29 

contractual obligations at december 31 2014  were comprised of interest on fixedrate longterm debt and capital leases longterm debt and capital leases note 8 operating leases note 9 agreements with crc note 5 unconditional purchase obligations note 16 longterm advances from conrail note 5 and unrecognized tax benefits note 3 

  



  

 when the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period when the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the other column 

  

off balance sheet arrangements  consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9 

  

cash used in investing activities  was 20 billion  in 2014  compared with 19 billion  in 2013  and 20 billion  in 2012  the increase in 2014 primarily reflected increased use of cash for property additions and coli investments which were partially offset by higher shortterm investment maturities the decrease in 2013 resulted from lower property additions and property sales that were partially offset by increased investment purchases net of sales 

  

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years

for 2015  we have budgeted 24 billion for property additions the anticipated spending includes 930 million for the normalized replacement of rail ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges planned equipment spending of 640 million includes used and rebuilt locomotives intermodal containers and chasis coal cars covered and open coil cars mill gondolas multilevel automobile racks and covered hoppers investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be 240 million and include terminals and equipment to add capacity to our intermodal network including crescent corridor new or expanded bulk transfer facilities improvements to vehicle distribution facilities and upgrades and expansions of our mechanical service shops for 2015 we have budgeted 220 million for the continued implementation of positive train control ptc and expect post2015 ptcrelated property additions to total over 450 million we also expect to spend 100 million on infrastructure improvements to increase mainline capacity accommodate business growth and provide our share of funding for various publicprivate partnership investments such as crescent corridor and the chicago create project technology investments of 70 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers 

additionally in november 2014 we announced a proposed transaction under which we would acquire 282 miles of the delaware  hudson railway co dh rail line between sunbury pennsylvania and schenectady new york for 217 million the acquisition of this property is subject to approval by the stb and if approved expected to be completed in 2015 

  

the crescent corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless highcapacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from new jersey to louisiana and offering truckcompetitive service along several major interstate highway corridors including i81 i85 i20 i40 i59 i78 and i75 based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief we plan to implement certain elements of the crescent corridor through a series of publicprivate partnerships currently the crescent corridor has received or expects to receive a total of 312 million in public capital funding commitments from the commonwealths of pennsylvania and virginia the state of tennessee the federal tiger stimulus program and other federal funding sources related to projects in alabama pennsylvania tennessee and north carolina with respect to the private funding component we currently anticipate spending up to 344 million 291 million of which has been spent to date for the substantial completion of work on these projects which is expected in 2015 this includes planned investments for the crescent corridor that approximate 42 million in 2015 if and when demand warrants additional improvements and expansions beyond these amounts may be made to the crescent corridor 

cash used in financing activities  was 13 billion  in 2014  compared with 394 million  in 2013  and 694 million  in 2012  the increase in 2014 was driven primarily by higher debt repayments and lower debt proceeds partially 

k  31 

offset by reduced share repurchase activity see note 14 the change in 2013 reflected lower share repurchases and reduced proceeds from borrowings net of debt repayments 

  

share repurchases totaled 318 million  in 2014  627 million  in 2013  and 13 billion  in 2012  for the purchase and retirement of 31 million  83 million  and 188 million  shares respectively on august 1 2012 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock through december 31 2017 and 352 million shares remain under this authority as of december 31 2014  the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by our assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash cash on hand or proceeds from borrowings 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we issued 400 million of 385 senior notes due 2024 during the third quarter of 2013 we issued 500 million of 480 senior notes due 2043 our debttototal capitalization ratio was 421 at december 31 2014  compared with 456 at december 31 2013  

  

we further discuss our current securities issuance authority from our our board of directors our credit agreement and our accounts receivable securitization program in note 8 of our notes to consolidated financial statements all of which provide for additional access to liquidity should the need arise 

  

upcoming annual debt maturities are relatively modest note 8 overall our goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we regularly discuss the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate actuarial assumptions and valuing related liabilities 

  

net pension expense which is included in “compensation and benefits” in the consolidated statements of income was 31 million  for 2014  in recording this amount we assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 825  which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception as well as our expectation of future returns a onepercentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 18 million  change in pension expense during 2014 new mortality tables were released for consideration in determining defined benefit plan obligations we analyzed the experience in our pension plans and updated our mortality rates accordingly which resulted in an actuarial loss of approximately 165 million we review assumptions related to our defined benefit plans annually and while changes are likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age 

k  32 

projected earnings and mortality they are not expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans 

  

net benefit for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was 6 million for 2014  historically medical inflation has been a significant component of the estimate for postretirement benefits however its effect has been reduced substantially due to the plan amendment made in 2014 note 11 since there is a fixed benefit for medicareeligible retirees there is no medical inflation assumed for this population the medical inflation factor is still applicable for premedicareeligible retirees 

  

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our total assets are longlived railway properties note 6 as disclosed in note 1 properties are depreciated using group depreciation the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives see note 1 for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in this area 

  

depreciation expense for 2014  totaled 951 million  our composite depreciation rates for 2014  are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 36 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense for 2014  roadway depreciation rates ranged from 083  to 3333  and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 155  to 3333  

  

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

  

casualties and other claims expense included in “materials and other” consists primarily of our accrual for personal injury liabilities and environmental remediation costs 

  

to aid in valuing personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm the actuarial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences we adjust the liability quarterly based upon our assessment and the results of the study our estimate of loss liabilities is subject to inherent limitation given the difficulty of predicting future events and as such the actual loss may vary from the estimated liability recorded 

  

we are subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations we record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates additionally our environmental policy council composed of senior managers oversees and interprets our environmental policy operating expenses included in materials and other and purchased services and rents for environmental matters totaled 45 million in 2014  57 million in 2013  and 40 million in 2012  and property additions for environmental matters totaled 9 million in 2014  8 million in 2013  and 6 million in 2012  property additions for environmental matters in 2015  are expected to be about 15 million 

we andor certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to earnings 

k  33 

for a more detailed discussion of the assumptions and estimates in accounting for personal injury and environmental matters see note 16 

income taxes 

  

our net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 88 billion  at december 31 2014  note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we had a 33 million  valuation allowance on 606 million  of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2014  reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized 

  

in addition we have a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we believe this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded for every one half percent change in the 2014  effective tax rate net income would have changed by 16 million 

  

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

  

more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee nccc moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose changes to the agreements the moratorium provisions of the current agreements have now expired formal proposals to change the agreements have been made and negotiations with the various labor unions have begun separately in january 2015 we reached an agreement covering wages and work rules through 2019 with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet which represents approximately 4600 of our locomotive engineers changes to the blet benefit plan will be bargained nationally through the nccc 

  

market risks 

  

we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments at december 31 2014  debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 200 million a onepercentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately 2 million we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

new accounting pronouncement 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers   this update effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning january 1 2017 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap and requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers early application is not permitted but once effective permits the use of either the 

k  34 

retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we are evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

  

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap requires the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in such property the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

forwardlooking statements 

  

this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements that may be identified by the use of words like “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “estimate” “plan” “consider” “project” and similar references to the future forwardlooking statements reflect our goodfaith evaluation of information currently available 

  

however such statements are dependent on and therefore can be influenced by a number of external variables over which we have little or no control including transportation of hazardous materials as a common carrier by rail acts of terrorism or war general economic conditions including but not limited to fluctuation and competition within the industries of our customers competition and consolidation within the transportation industry the operations of carriers with which we interchange disruptions to our technology infrastructure including computer systems labor difficulties including strikes and work stoppages commercial operating environmental and climate change legislative and regulatory developments results of litigation natural events such as severe weather hurricanes and floods unpredictable demand for rail services fluctuation in supplies and prices of key materials in particular diesel fuel and changes in securities and capital markets for additional discussion of significant risk factors applicable to our business see part ii item 1a “risk factors” forwardlooking statements are not and should not be relied upon as a guarantee of future performance or results nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved as a result actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements we undertake no obligation to update or revise forwardlooking statements

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the assistance of management evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act at december 31 2014  based on such evaluation our officers have concluded that at december 31 2014  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time period specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data we recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

  

in order to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective we regularly assess such controls and did so most recently for our financial reporting at december 31 2014  this assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework   2013  based on our assessment we have concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2014  

  

our board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies financial reporting and internal control the audit committee of our board of directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management the independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee 

  

we have issued a report of our assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2014  these reports appear in part ii item 8 of this report on form 10k 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2014  we have not identified any changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially effect our internal control over financial reporting

in 2013  119 million tons of general merchandise freight or approximately 62 of total general merchandise tonnage we handled  originated on our lines      the balance of general merchandise freight was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways     our p rincipal interchange points for received freight included chicago new orleans east st louis memphis detroit kansas city buffalo toledo and meridian      general merchandise carloads handled in 2013 were 24   million the revenues from which accounted for 56 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

see the discussion of general merchandise revenues by commodity group in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

intermodal – our intermodal market group consists of shipments moving in trailers domestic and international containers and roadrailer® equipment     these shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies international steamship lines truckers and other shippers     intermodal units handled in 2013 were 36 million the revenues from which accounted for 21 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

see th e discussion of intermodal revenues in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

freight rates – p rivate contracts and exempt price quotes are our predominant pricing mechanisms     thus a major portion of our freight business is not economically regulated by the federal governm ent     in general market forces are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

in 2013  our railroads were found by the us surface transportation board  stb  the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices to be “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on results for the year 2012  the stb has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2013  a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital     this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement

track maintenance – of the 36119 total miles of track we operate we are responsible for maintaining 28957 miles  with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance 

  

over 82 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard     approximately 44 of our lines excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2013  

  

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding our track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 

  

 

  

microwave system – our microwave system consisting of approximately 6968 radio route miles 421 core stations 30 secondary stations and five passive repeater stations provides communications be tween most operating locations we use the microwave system primarily for voice communications vhf radio control circuits data and facsimile transmissions traffic control operations and aei data transmissions 

  

traffic control – of the approximately 16500 route miles we dispatch about 11025 miles are signalized including 8200 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 2825 miles of automatic block signals     of the 8200 miles of ctc approximately 6836 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 336 base station radio sites 

  

computers – a computer network consisting of a centralized production and backup data center near atlanta georgia and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards terminals transportation offices rolling stock repair points sales offices and other key system locations     operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system     computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data     in addition our computer systems assist us in the performance of a 

k 10 

  

variety of functions and services  including payroll car and revenue accounting billing sourcing inventory management activities and controls and special studies 

  

environmental matters – compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is one our principal goal s      to date such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations  liquidity or competitive position     see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 “personal injury environmental and legal liabilities” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

employees – the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 

  

 more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargainin g agreements with various labor union s see the discussion of “labor agreements” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”   

  

government regulation – in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generall y applicable to all business our railroads are subject to regulation by the stb     the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines     the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers     the federal railroad administration fra regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards 

  

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 included exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from regulation for the duration of the contract about 88 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

efforts have been made over the past several years to resubject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation  and such efforts are expected to continue in 201 4      the staggers rail act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers  and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry     accordingly we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation   

  

government regulations concerning the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition – there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers     price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products     even for raw materials s emifinished goods and workin progress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

k 11 

  

  

our primary rail competitor is csx corporation  both railroads operate throughout much of the same territory     other railroads also operate in parts of the territory     we also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets   

  

security of operations – we continue to take measures to provide enhanced s ecurity for our rail system our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001     the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases     the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas     1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police     although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents our system security plan outlines the protocol within our company for all concerned to be notified of aar alert level changes     all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

  

our plan also effectively addresses and complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials     as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and recertification programs     toward that end we  working closely with the national transit institute at rutgers university developed a fourmodule uniform national training program     we ha ve also worked with the transportation security administration tsa in developing other industry training programs     more indepth security training has been given to select employees of ours who have been given specific security responsibilities and additional locationspecific security plans are in place for certain metropolitan areas and each of the six port facilities we serve     with respect to the ports each facility plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and remains subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

  

additionally we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the tsa the federal bureau o f investigation fbi the fra  the us coast guard us customs and border protection and various state homeland security offices     as one notable example one of our police special agent s in charge sac under the auspices of the aar continues to serve at the national joint terrorism task force njttf operated by the fbi and located at the national counter terrorism center nctc in arlington v irginia to represent and serve as liaison to the north american rail industry     this arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole while having the post filled by one of our sac s also serves to foster a strong working relationship between us and the fbi     we also are a member of the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat prog ram sponsored by us customs ctpat allows us to work closely with us customs and our customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on our railroads  particularly those moving to or from a foreign country     based on participation in ctpat we ha ve ensured that our plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by us customs 

  

similarly we continue to be guided in our operations by various supplemental security action items issued by dhs and dot us coast guard maritime security requirements as well as voluntary security action items developed in collaboration with tsa dot and the freight railroads many of the action items are based on lessons learned from dhs and dot security assessments of rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in htua by     1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail 

k 12 

  

cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify through risk assessments those locations where security risks are the highest     these action items and our compliance initiatives are outlined in the vario us departmental sections of our system security plan     we ha ve taken appropriate actions to be compliant with the tsa final security rule addressing rail security sensitive materials rssm to ensure these shipments are properly inspected and that positive chainofcustody is maintained when required     we are in compliance with the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa railrouting regulations outlined in docket hm232e     we conduct ongoing route evaluations     in 2011 as part of the fra’s biannual review this metho dology and selected routes were found to be compliant with the regulation  the next review by the fra is expected midyear 2014 

  

in 2013  through participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response transcaer program we provided rail accident response training to approximately 4900 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel  our other training efforts throughout 2013 included participation in 17 drills for local state and federal agencies     we also ha ve ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the security and emergency response training course conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado 

  

improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security     phmsa in coordination with the fra has amend ed the hazardous materials regulations to prescribe enhanced safety for rail transportation of tih materials has provided interim design standards for railroad tank cars     the rule mandates commodityspecific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured dot specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard     the interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of tih tank cars   

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

we are subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial operating and environmental matters   railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry     railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the surface transportation board  stb   which has jurisdiction over some rates  routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines     the stb also has jurisdiction over the c onsolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers     additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congre ss or the stb whether under new or existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter     this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

  

railroads are subject to safet y and security regulation by the us department of transportation and the us department of homeland security which regulate most aspects of our operations     compliance with the rail safety improvement act of 2008 will result in additional operating costs associated with the statutorily mandated implementation of positive train control by 2015     in addition to increased capital expenditures implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses and increased claims and litigation costs 

  

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases     the risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions past present and future – is inherent in the railroad business     this risk includes property owned by us  whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

k 13 

  

  

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties     moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

a s a common carrier by rail we must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk t ransportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property including environmental damage  and compromise critical parts of our rail network   a catastrophic rail accident involving hazardous materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance we have obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages however insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 

  

we may be affected by terrorism or war     any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter     because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

  

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism     in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

  

we may be affected by general economic conditions     prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities we carr y may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter      economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

we may be affected by climate change legislation or regulation     concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions     moreover even without such legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry     restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs decrease the amount of traffic handled and decrease the value of coal reserves we own  and thus could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter      such restrictions could affect our customers that 1 use commodities that we carr y to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carr y  or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy 

  

we face competition from other transportation providers     we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and  to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of tr ansit time pricing and quality and reliability of service     while we ha ve used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities     any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

k 14 

  

the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations     our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canad a depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

  

we rel y on technology and technology improvements in our business operations     if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption a security breach or other operational difficulties  additionally if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service  any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions     if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations     additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits     any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures     the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters     jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system     the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded 

  

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance     we ha ve obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages     specified levels of risk are retained on a selfinsurance basis currently up to 50 million and above 1 billion per occurrence andor policy year for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and up to 25 million and above 175 million per occurrence andor policy year for property owned by us or in our care custody or control     insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us  

  

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures     severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operational efficiency and ability to meet demand     workforce demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a 

k 15 

  

negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail service     unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets     we consumed 477 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2013      fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations     a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter     also such an event c ould impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies 

  

due to the capital intensive nature and industryspecific requirements of the rail industry high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally we compete with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials such as rail and ties     changes in the competitive landscapes of these limitedsupplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shortages of materials that could have a material adverse e ffect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity     f rom timetotime we rel y on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of longterm debt instruments and commercial paper as well as the sale of certain receivables     significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds     instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial condition alone or in combination could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict us from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates approximately 20000 miles of road in 22 states and the district of columbia serves every major container port in the eastern united states and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers we operate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a major transporter of coal automotive and industrial products 

  

our net income increased 9 in 2013  compared with 2012  and earnings per share improved 12  reflecting improved operating results a large gain from a nonoperating transaction and share repurchases higher revenues and increased network efficiencies improved our railway operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses from 717 in 2012 to 710 in the current year  

  

cash provided by operating activities totaled  31 billion  which along with proceeds from borrowings and cash on hand allowed for property additions dividends share repurchases and debt repayments during 2013  we repurchased 83 million shares of common stock at a total cost of  627 m illion since inception of our stock repurchase program in 2006 we have repurchased and retired 1367 million shares of common stock at a total cost of  81 billion at december 31 2013  cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled  16   b illion 

  

in 2014  we expect revenues to increase reflecting higher volumes     we will continue to focus on safety cost control productivity s ervice levels  operational efficiency and a n ongoing marketbased approach to pricing

summarized results of operations 

  

2013 compared w ith 2012 

  

net income in 2013 was  19 billion or  604 per diluted share up  161 million or 9  compared with  17   billion or  537 per diluted share in 2012  a reflection of a 4 increase in income from railway operations in addition to the favorable impact of the recognition of the gain from the sale of certain assets to the michigan department of transportation mdot which benefited net income by 60   million and earnings per share by 019 railway operating revenues rose 2  while operating expenses increased 1  driven largely by higher volumerelated expenses 

  

2012 compared with 2011 

  

net income in 2012 was  17 billion or  537 per diluted share down  167 million or 9  compared with 

 19 billion or  545 per diluted share in 2011      the de crease in net income was due to lower income from railway operations  l ower nonoperating income items higher interest expense on debt and a higher effective income tax rate note 3     railway operating revenues de creased modestly  132 m illion reflecting low er average revenue per u nit including fuel surcharges      railway operating expenses also decreased modestly  43 million largely driven by the absence of the 58   million unfavorable arbitration ruling in 2011 and declines related to network efficiency and productivity gains offset by higher depreciation and intermodal volumerelated expenses 

  

detailed results of operations 

  

railway operati ng revenues 

  

railway operating revenues were  112 billion in 2013   110 billion in 2012  and  112 billion in 2011      the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes and average revenue per unit by market group 

  

   

k 22 

  

revenues in creased  205 m illion in 2013  but decreased  132 m illion in 2012      a s reflected in the table below the increase in 2013 resulted from higher volumes partially offset by lower average revenue per unit as lower marketbased export coal rates the effects of changes in the mix of business and slightly lower fuel surcharges more than offset rate increases t he de crease in 2012 was due to lower average revenue per unit  as the negative effects of changes in the mix of business offset rate increases and slightly higher fuel surcharges  and slightly lower volume fuel surcharge revenue totaled  1254   million in 2013   1278 million in 2012  and  1255   million in 2011  if fuel prices remain at or near yearend 2013 levels fuel surcharge revenue will be relatively flat in 2014  

  

   

many of our negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and industrial products shipments are based on the monthly average price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti average price these surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the wti average price for the second preceding calendar month this twomonth lag in applying wti average price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately  29 million in 2013  increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately  39 million in 2012  and decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately  44 million in 2011  

  

two of our customers dupont and sunbelt chlor alkai partnership “sunbelt” have rate reasonableness complaints pending before the surface transportation board  stb  alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable     we dispute th ese allegation s since june 1 2009 in the case of dupont and april 1 2011 in the case of sunbelt we ha ve been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates     we presently expect resolution of the se case s to occur in 201 4 and believe the estimate of reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity     with regard to rate cases we record adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and estimable 

  

coal revenues de creased  336 million or 12  compared with 2012  reflecting a 5 de crease in carload volume tonnage hauled declined 4 primarily due to fewer shipments of utility and domestic metallurgical coal a verage revenue per unit was down 7  the result of lower pricing mainly marketbased export coal and decreased fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by the positive effect of changes in mix 

  

in 2012  coal revenues de creased  579 million or 17  compared with 2011  reflecting a 13 decrease in carload volume tonnage was 12 lower primarily due to fewer shipments of utility coal coal average revenue per unit was down 5 compared with 2011  the result of lower pricing mainly marketbased export metallurgical coal and decreased fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by the positive effect of changes in mix 

  

for 2014  coal revenues are expected to de crease  although more modestly due to fewer carloads and lower average revenue per unit 

k 23 

  

coal represented 23 of our revenues in 2013  and 79 of shipments handled originated on our lines     as shown i n the following table tonnage de creased in our utility and domestic metallurgical markets but increased slightly in our export and industrial markets  

  

   

utility coal tonnage was down 4 in 2013 as compared to 2012  utility coal shipments in our southern region decreased due to lower demand as utility stockpiles remained high and natural gas prices remained low this decrease was partially offset by increased shipments in our northern region as higher coal burn necessitated stockpile replenishments to maintain targeted levels 

  

in 2012  utility coal tonnage dropped 17  compared with 2011  reflecting competition from low natural gas prices and reduced electrical demand in nsserved regions additional tonnage declines resulted from plant closures and maintenance 

  

for 2014  we expect utility coal tonnage to de cre ase driven by continued weak demand as well as the loss of a contract 

  

export coal tonnage in creased 1 in 2013  compared with 2012  despite strong global competition we handled higher export thermal and metallurgical coal shipments as an increase in steel production in developing markets offset weakness in the european market volume through norfolk was up 21 million tons or 11  whereas baltimore volume decreased 14 million tons or 17  other export volume decreased 04   million tons or 36  

  

in 2012  ex port coal tonnage de creased 1 compared with 2011  a reflection of weaker global demand for metallurgical coal used in steel production in nsserved markets in addition to the negative impact of the return of australian supply offset in part by increased thermal shipments volume through norfolk was down 13   million tons or 6  whereas volume through baltimore increased 03 million tons or 4    other export coal volume increased 08 million tons 

  

for 2014  export coal tonnage is expected to decrease as a result of strong competition in the western european metallurgical coal market in addition to soft demand and an oversupply of thermal coal 

  

k 24 

  

domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was down 10 in 2013  c ompared with 2012  due to weaker domestic steel production sourcing shifts away from coal origins we serve and the permanent closure of a steel plant in mid2012 that impacted the yearoveryear comparison for the first half of 2013 

  

in 2012  d omestic metallurgical coal tonnage was down 5 compared with 2011 as declines in coke and iron ore shipments primarily due to the plant closure offset improved domestic steel production experienced in the first half of 2012 

  

for 2014  domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to be flat with 2013  as improved steel demand should offset losses due to sourcing shifts 

  

industrial coal tonnage in creased slightly in 2013  compared with 2012  as increased shipments to existing customers was partially offset by weaker industrial demand in the print paper and cement sectors  

  

in 2012  industrial coal tonnage de creased 4 compared to 2011  as weak industrial demand was partially offset by new business  

  

for 2014  industrial coal tonnage is expected to increase slightly due to higher demand in the us industrial sector 

  

general merchandise revenues in 2013 increased  398 million or 7  compared with 2012  reflecting 4 growth in carload volume and a 3 improvement in average revenue per unit that reflected favorable changes in the mix of traffic increases in higherthanaverage revenue per unit traffic as well as higher rates and fuel surcharges      

  

in 2012  general merchandise revenues inc reased  336 million or 6  compared with 2011  reflecting a 4 rise in average revenue per unit as a result of higher rates and fuel surcharges carload volume increased 2  

  

chemicals revenues in 2013 increased 14  compared with 2012  reflecting 16 growth in volume partially offset by a 2 decline in average revenue per unit that resulted from the negative effect of the changes in mix due to increased crude oil shipments the volume improvement was primarily the result of more carloads of crude oil from the bakken and canadian oil fields additionally there were more carloads of liquefied petroleum gas in the utica shale region  

  

in 2012  chemicals revenue s grew 7  compared with 2011  reflecting 4 growth in volume and a 3 increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from higher rates and fuel surcharges the volume improvement was largely the result of more carloads of crude oil from the bakken and canadian oil fields additionally there were more carloads of liquefied petroleum gas as well as higher shipments of plastics driven by greater demand for plastic bottles these increases were offset in part by fewer shipments of rock salt as a mild winter resulted in higher inventory levels throughout 2012  

  

for 2014  chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase  largely a result of more shipments of crude oil and asphalt 

  

agriculture consumer products and government revenues in creased 1 in 2013  compared with 2012  as a 2 improvement in average revenue per unit reflecting pricing improvements that were slightly offset by a negative change in mix related to the increase of lowerrated shorterhaul movements of corn was partially offset by a slight decline in volume the volume decline was driven by reduced shipments of soybeans and related products caused by tightened supplies of domestic beans and a strong south american crop in addition to fewer revenue movements of empty equipment carload volume declines were partially offset by higher shipments of food oils as we handled new business with existing customers and more biodiesel carloads in advance of the anticipated elimination of the biodiesel tax credit we also hauled more shipments of fertilizer due to a strong farm economy and increased planting activity 

k 25 

  

  

in 2012  agriculture consumer products and government revenues were relatively flat  compared with 2011  as higher average revenue per unit was offset by lower volume the volume decline was driven by reduced corn shipments due to plant closures fewer carloads of fertilizer led by certain network classification changes and reduced shipments of wheat to the eastern us due to customer sourcing changes these volume declines were offset in part by more shipments of soybean and soybean meal due to a poor south american bean crop as well as higher shipments of cornbased feed to texas 

  

for 2014  agriculture consumer products and government revenues are expected to improve as a result of higher average revenue per unit offset in part by a slight decrease in volume the projected decline in volume is based primarily on fewer shipments of corn as we anticipate that strong local production will prompt customer sourcing changes as well as reduced shipments of wheat feed with a partial offset by anticipated market share growth in perishables beverages and consumer products 

  

metals and construction revenues increased 5 in 2013  compared with 2012      the revenue improvement resulted from 6 higher average reve nue per unit which reflected the positive change in mix of business as we transported higherrated shipments of slag and fractionating sand for natural gas drilling higher rates and increased fuel surcharges although we moved more slag and fractionating carloads v olume declined modestly as we handled reduced shipments of iron and steel driven by fewer import slabs and a steel plant closure during the third quarter of 2012 and scrap metal a result of weakening demand 

  

in 2012  metals and construction revenues increased 8  compared with 2011  the improvement resulted from 7 higher average revenue per unit which reflected higher rates and fuel surcharges volume improved 1  the result of more coil steel shipments driven by increased automotive production the mild winter weather experienced in early and late 2012 led to more shipments of cement for construction projects there were also higher shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling these increases were partially offset by fewer aggregates carloads primarily driven by weak market conditions in roadhighway construction and as lower coal utility burn led to fewer shipments of scrubber stone 

  

for 2014  metals and construction revenues are expected to increase reflecting higher shipments of fractionating sand and other materials used for natural gas drilling as well as additional shipments of steel used by the automotive and energy sectors average revenue per unit is also anticipated to improve 

  

automotive revenues rose 10 compared to 2012  reflecting 7 growth in volume due to increased vehicle production at plants we serve and new business from existing customers including both auto parts and finished vehicles average revenue per unit improved 2  reflecting improved pricing and higher fuel surcharges  

  

in 2012  automotive revenues rose 15  compared to 2011  reflecting a 13 rise in volume due to increased vehicle production at plants we serve and a 2 improvement in average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges 

  

for 2014  automotive revenues are expected to grow as a result of volume gains driven by a continued increase in domestic production at plants we serve  in addition to higher average revenue per unit 

  

paper clay and forest products revenues increased 3 in 2013  compared with 2012  reflecting 1 gains in both volume and average revenue per unit volume increases for lumber pulp and pulpboard were offset by reduced demand for newsprint and paper 

  

in 2012  paper clay and forest products revenues increased 3  compared with 2011  reflecting a 5 improvement in average revenue per unit due to increased rates which more than offset the effects of a 3 volume decline the lower volume was due to reduced shipments of miscellaneous wood driven by the loss of business and fewer carloads of pulp as a result of declining export market demand 

k 26 

  

for 2014  paper clay and forest produ cts revenues are anticipated to decline as we expect reduced shipments of miscellaneous wood due to market share loss in addition to fewer shipments of pulp and graphic paper as demand declines partially offset by improvements in the housing market and higher average revenue per unit 

  

intermodal revenues increased  143 million or 6  compared with 2012  reflecting a 6 growth in volume average revenue per unit was flat      

  

domestic volume  including truckload and intermodal marketing companies  triple crown services and premium business i mprov ed 7  the result of continued highwaytorail conversions and additional business associated with the opening of new intermodal terminals i nternational traffic volume grew 6  due to growth with existing customers as the economy continued to improve 

  

in 2012  intermodal revenues increased  111 million or 5  compared with 2011  reflecting 5 growth in volume largely due to increased domestic units resulting from continued highwaytorail conversions average revenue per unit improved 1 as a result of higher fuel surcharges partially offset by lower pricing     domestic volume increased 8 reflecting continued highway conversions international volume declined 1  as the loss of business from a shipping line was partially offset by growth across remaining international customers 

  

for 2014  intermodal revenues are exp ected to increase due to higher v olume and average revenue per unit as a result of continued highway conversions and growth associated with our new intermodal terminals  

  

railway operating expenses 

  

railway operating expenses in 2013 were  80 billion up  72 m illion or 1 compared to 2012      expenses in 2012 were  79 billion down  43 m illion  or 1  compared to 2011  i n 2013  higher wage rates and volumerelated expense increases were offset in part by lower costs resulting from network efficiencies for 2012  the decrease reflected the absence of 2011’s 58   million unfavorable arbitration ruling and lower costs due to gains in network efficiency offset in part by higher volumerelated expenses 

  

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

  

   

k 27 

  

compensation and benefits  which represents 38 of total operating expenses in creased  42 million or 1  in 2013  reflecting changes in  

•   pay rates up  59 million 

•   incentive and stockbased compensation  up  39 million 

•   lower activity levels  down  48 million that reflected improved employee productivity and 

•   payroll taxes down 16 million 

  

in 2012  compensation and benefits de creased  14 million compared with 2011  primarily due to changes in 

•   employee activity levels down 40 million 

•   incentive and stockbased compensation down 35 million 

•   pay rates up 43 million and 

•   pension and postretirement benefit costs up 16 million 

  

our employment averaged 30103 in 2013  compared with 30943 in 2012  and 30329 in 2011      the decrease in 2013 reflected the benefit from operational efficiencies looking forward to 2014  we expect employment levels to be consistent with those of 2013  in addition as a result of net actuarial gains related to pension and other postretirement benefits we expect expenses associated with these benefits to be approximately 25   million lower per quarter in 2014 we also expect favorable labor hour trends to continue these declines are expected to be offset in part by higher wage rates 

  

fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fue l used in railway operations in creased  36 million or 2  in 2013  but dec reased  12 million or 1  in 2012      the increase in 2013 was principally the result of higher locomotive fuel consumption  up 4   offset in part by lower locomotive fuel prices down 2   

  

the de crease in 2012 reflected lower locomotive fuel consumption  down 3   offset in part by higher locomotive fuel prices  up 3   

  

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rental s     this category of expenses in creased  25 million or 2  in 2013  but de creased  6 million in 2012  

  

   

the increase in 2013 for p urchased services costs reflected higher volumerelated activities and software expenses partially offset by lower professional and consulting fees and travel expenses the increase in 2012 reflected higher professional and consulting fees intermodal operations expenses conrailrelated casualty costs 15 million and advertising expenses these increases were partially offset by lower haulage expenses 

  

e quipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment decreased in 2013 and 2012 as a result of increased velocity and improved equipment utilization 

  

k 28 

  

depreciation expense was flat in 2013  but increased  54 million or 6  in 2012      both periods reflect ed our larger roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock in 2013  that increase was completely offset by the favorable impact of an equipment study that was completed during the first quarter of 2013    we expect depreciation expense in 2014 to be approximately 40   million higher than 2013  

  

materials and other expenses de creased  31 million or 4  in 2013  and  65 million or 7  in 2012  as shown in the following table 

  

   

in 2013  lower expenses for casualties and other claims more than offset higher costs for materials casualties and other claims expenses includ e the estimates of costs related to personal injury pi  property damag e and environmental matters over the last two years we have experienced lower pi expenses that have been offset in part by higher environmental expenses resulting in net benefits of 52   million in 2013 and 27   million in 2012 the lower pi expenses have been driven by improved historical trend rates resulting in favorable reserve adjustments for prior years’ claim amounts going forward if favorable trends continue for pi costs we could see additional favorable adjustments however likely not at the levels experienced in 2013 

  

the de crease in 2012 reflected the absence of 2011’s unfavorable arbitration ruling discussed below and the favorable reserve developments discussed above these favorable items were partially offset by higher costs associated with property taxes 

  

the consolidated balance sheets reflect longterm receivables for estimated recoveries from our insurance carriers for claims associated with the january 6 2005 derailment in graniteville sc in the first quarter of 2011 we received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier and w ere denied recovery of the contested portion of the claim     as a result we recorded a 43 million charge for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a 15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery was no longer probable     

  

pi c ases involving occupational injuries comprised about 28 of total employee injury cases resolved and about 17 of total employee injury payments made     with our longestablished commitment to safety we continue to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and reduce the associated costs     with respect to occupational injuries which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately     the majority of these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades     the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers’ liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads     fela’s faultbased system which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers’ compensation system 

  

we maintain substantial amounts of insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims     we also retain reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance  note 16 

  

k 29 

  

other income – net 

  

other income – net was  233 million in 2013   129 million in 2012  and  160 million in 2011  note 2     the in crease in 2013 reflected a 97 million land sale gain in michigan and higher net returns from corporateowned life insurance coli which was partially offset by lower coal royalties 

  

the decline in 2012 reflected fewer gains on the sale of property decreased coal royalties and higher interest expense net on uncertain tax positions offset in part by higher net returns from coli increased equity in the earnings of conrail and higher rental income 

  

income taxes 

  

income tax expense in 2013 was  11 billion an effective rate of 36  compared with 37 in 2012 and 34 in 2011      the decrease in the rate for 2013 was primarily due to tax credits that became available in 2013 as a result of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 2012 act enacted january 2 2013 and favorable reductions in deferred tax expense for state law changes the in crease in the rate for 2012 primarily reflects the absence of 2011’s favorable resolution of the internal revenue service irs examination of our 2008 return and review of certain claims for refund 40   million and the absence of a favorable reduction in deferred tax expense for state law changes 28   million 

  

the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act enacted in 2010 allowed 100   percent bonus depreciation for 2011 and fiftypercent bonus depreciation in 2012 additionally the 2012 act as mentioned in the paragraph above extended fiftypercent bonus depreciation for an additional year while bonus depreciation does not affect our total provision for income taxes or the effective rate the absence of bonus depreciation is expected to increase current income tax expense and the related cash outflows for the payment of income taxes in 2014 by approximately 200   million the 2012 act also reinstated certain business tax credits retroactively for 2012 and for 2013 but these provisions expired at the end of 2013 

  

irs examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2011 we expect the irs will begin auditing our 2011 and 2012 consolidated income tax returns in early 2014 

  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities our principal source of liquidity was  31 billion in both 2013 and 2012 and  32 billion in 2011  the decrease in 2012 reflected increased tax payments driven by reduced bonus depreciation in addition to lower operating results  we had working capital of  770 million at december 31 2013  compared with  161 million at december 31 2012  primarily reflecting higher cash and shortterm investment balances as a result of new debt issued and lower share repurchase activity in 2013  partially offset by an increase in our current maturities of longterm debt      c ash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances totaled  16 b illion and  668 million at december   31   2013 and 2012  respectively and w ere invested in accordance with our corporate investment policy as approved by the board of directors     the portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk     there are no limits or restrictions on our access to these assets     we expect cash on hand co mbined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations 

  

k 30 

  

contractual obligations at december 31 2013  were comprised of interest on fixedrate longterm debt and capital leases longterm debt and capital leases  note 8 operating leases note 9 agreements with crc note 5 unconditional purchase obligations note 16  longterm adva nces from conrail note 5 and unrecognized tax benefits note 3 

  

   

 when the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period     when the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the other column 

  

off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9 

  

cash used in investing activities was  19 billion in 2013  compared with  20 billion in 2012  and  18   billion in 2011      the de crease in 2013 primarily reflects fewer property additions and property sales that were partially offset by increased investment purchases net of sales      the 2012 increase resulted from a decrease in investment sales net of purchases and increased property additions that were offset in part by proceeds from property sales  

  

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category     the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 

  

   

   

k 31 

  

  

   

f or 2014  we have b udgeted  22 b illion for property additions the anticipated spending includes  910 million for the normalized replacement of rail ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges     planned equipment spending of  550 million includes new and rebuilt locomotives coal cars intermodal containers and chassis covered and open coil cars and multilevel automobile racks     investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be  210 million and include intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network  including crescent corridor  continued progress on our multiyear project to expand the bellevue yard in northern ohio and mechanical service shops we have budgeted 2 20   million for the continued implementation of positive train control ptc and expect remaining additional ptcrelated property additions to total at least  670 million     we also expect to spend  50 million on infrastructure improvements to increase mainline capacity accommodate business growth and provide our share of funding for various publicprivate partnership investments such as crescent corridor and the chicago create project  technology investments of  70 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers 

  

the crescent corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless highcapacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from new jersey to louisiana and offering truckcompetitive service along several major interstate highway corridors including i81 i85 i20 

i40 i59 i78 and i75     based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief we plan to implement certain elements of the crescent corridor through a series of publicprivate partnerships     currently the crescent corridor has received or expects to receive a total of  309 million in public capital funding commitments from the commonwealths of pennsylv ania and virginia the s tate of tennessee the federal tiger stimulus program and other federal funding sources related to projects in alabama pennsylvania tennessee and north carolina     with respect to the private funding component we currently anticipate spending up to  315 million 260   million of which has been spent to date for the substantial completion of work on these projects which is expected in 201 5      this includes p lanned investments for the crescent corridor that approximate  42 million in 2014 and 13   million in 2015    if and when demand warrants additional improvements and expansions beyond these amounts may be made to the crescent corridor 

  

cash used in financing activities was  394 m illion in 2013  compared with  694 m illion in 2012  and  2 0   billion in 2011      the change in 2013 includes lower share repurchases and reduced proceeds from borrowings net of debt repayments t he change in 2012 reflected lower share repurchases increased proceeds from borrowings reduced debt repayments and maturities offset in part by higher dividends

application of critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us g enerally a ccepted a ccounting p rinciples gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period     these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions     accordingly we regularly review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances     we regularly discuss the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note   11     these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality     in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value     we make these estimates based on our historical experience and other information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock marke t performance     we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing related liabilities 

  

net pension expense which is included in “compensation and benefits” in the consolidated statements of income was  69 million for 2013      in recording this amount we assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 825  which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception  as well as our expectation of future returns      a one  percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a  18 million change in pension expense     changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future     the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments     we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality 

k 33 

  

corporate bonds     we use the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans 

  

net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was  108   million for 2013      in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits we estimated future increases in healthcare costs     these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note   11 

  

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our total assets are longlived railway properties note 6     as disclosed in note 1 properties are depreciated using group depreciation     the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life     units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources     remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives 

  

d epreciation expense is based on assumptions concerning expected service lives of properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement     in developing these assumptions we utilize periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the stb      d epreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property     the frequency of these studies correlates with guidelines established by the stb 

  

key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include 

•   statistical analyses of historical retirement data and surviving asset records 

•   review of historical salvage received and current market rates 

•   review of our operations including expected changes in technology customer demand maintenance practices and asset management strategies 

•   review of accounting policies and assumptions and 

•   industry review and analysis 

  

the units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors     our experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors     in developing the respective depreciation rate consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age weight condition new or second hand and type curve or straight     as a result a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base 

  

we adjust our rates based on the results of these studies and implement the changes prospectively      these studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study     any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property a s determined by the study d epreciation expense for 2013 totaled  916 million     our composite depreciation rates for 2013 are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a  35 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense     for 2013  roadway depreciation rates ranged from 083 to 333 and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 140 to 3333  

  

when properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business the cost of the assets net of sale proceeds or salvage is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings     actual historical cost values are retired when available such as with equipment assets     the use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs     when retiring rail ties and ballast we use statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired     the historical cost of other roadway assets is 

k 34 

  

estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the us bureau of labor statistics     the indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets     these indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in “other income – net” note 2 since such income is not a product of our railroad operations 

  

a retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates     gains or losses from abnormal retirements would be recognized in earnings however there were no such gains or losses in 2013  2012  or 2011  

  

we review the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flow     assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review would be recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value  however there were no such impairments in 2013  2012  or 2011  

  

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

  

c asualties and other claims expense  included in “materials and other” total ed  90 million in 2013   130 million in 2012  and  216   million in 2011  historically most of this expense relates to our accrual for personal injury liabilities  however over the last few years our personal injury expense has decreased due to improved historical trend rates for prior years’ claims environmental expenses which are also included in this category have increased over the last few years as a result of unfavorable developments and more aggressive remediation strategies      

  

jobrelated personal injury and occupa tional claims are subject to fela which is applicable only to railroads     fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system     the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded     in all cases we record a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable 

  

to aid in valuing personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm     for employee personal injury cases the actu arial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences  we estimate the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for inc urred but unasserted claims based on the results of this analysis     for occupational injury claims  the actuarial firm studies our history of claim filings severity payments and other relevant facts     additionally our estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting our experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined   we have recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves  as well as our and the actuarial firm’s judgments in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which we would recognize wh en such a change became known w hile the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study it is possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower   

  

we are subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations     we record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably note 16     claims if any against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs we’ve incurred are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the consolidated balance sheets and are not n etted against the associated l iability   environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates     we ha ve an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret our environmental policy 

k 35 

  

  

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled  57 million in 2013   40 million in 2012  and  32 million in 2011  and property additions for environmental matters totaled  8 million in 2013   6 million in 2012  and  7   million in 2011      property additions for environmental matters in 2014 are expected to be about  11 million 

  

our cons olidated balance sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures of  58 million at december 31 2013  and  42 million at december 31 2012 of which  15 million is classifi ed as a current liability at december   31 2013 and 12 million at december 31 2012      at december 31 2013  the liability represents our estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 142 known locations and projects     as of that date ten sites accounted for  30 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material     we anticipate that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period 

  

at 12 locations one or more of our subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs     we calculate our estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability 

  

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by us or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of our ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss and that participant’s ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability     we estimate our environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments we dee m appropriate for each site     as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these ma ny assumptions and judgments     we ha ve consistently applied our methodology of estimating our environmental liabilities 

  

based on the assessment of facts and circumstances now known we believe we have recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which we are aware     further we believe that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

we andor certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations     when we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to e arnings      while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on futu re developments in our opinion the recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims     however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter     any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

  

k 36 

  

income taxes 

  

our net longterm deferred tax liability totaled  85 billion at december 31 2013  note 3     this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements     after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in our income tax returns     for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation all owance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we had a  32   million valuation allowance on  630 m illion of deferred tax assets as of december 3 1 2013  r eflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized 

  

in addition we ha ve a recorded liability for our estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return     judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority     we believe this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate     income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded     for every one half percent change in the 2013 effective tax rate net income would have changed by  15 million 

  

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

  

more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee nccc moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes to the agreements  

  

we and t he nccc have concluded the round of bargaining that began in november 2009 and reached agreements that extend through december   31 2014 with all applicable labor unions with regard to the wheelersburg ohio terminal workers who are represented by the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes division bmwed negotiations are ongoing and mediation under the auspices of the national mediation board is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2014 

  

m arket risks 

  

we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments at december 31 2013  debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled  200 million a onepercentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately  2 million we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap require s the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property     as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in such property     the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost

internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data     we recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control     accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation     further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

  

in order to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective we regularly assess such controls and did so most recently for our financial reporting at december 31 2013      this assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework 1992      based on our assessment we have concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2013  

  

our board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies financial reporting and internal control     the audit committee of our board of directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management     the independent registere d public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee

in 2012  119 million tons of general merchandise freight or approximately 65 of total general merchandise tonnage we handled  originated online     the balance of general merchandise freight was received from connecting carriers at interterritorial gateways     our p rincipal interchange points for received freight included chicago new orleans east st louis memphis buffalo and detroit      general merchandise carloads handled in 2012 were 23   million the revenues from which accounted for 54 of our to tal railway operating revenues 

  

see the discussion of general merchandise revenues by commodity group in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

intermodal – our intermodal market group co nsists of shipments moving in trailers domestic and international containers and roadrailer® equipment     these shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies international steamship lines truckers and other shippers     intermodal uni ts handled in 2012 were 34 million the revenues from which accounted for 20 of our total railway operating revenues 

  

see th e discussion of intermodal revenues in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

  

freight rates – in 2012  we continued our reliance on priv ate contracts and exempt price quotes as the predominant pricing mechanisms     thus a major portion of our freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government     in general market forces have been substituted for government regulatio n and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

  

in 2012  our railroads were found by the surface transportation board  stb  the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices to be “revenue adeq uate” on an annual basis based on results for the year 2011  the stb has not made its revenue adequacy determination for the year 2012  a railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital     this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement

the following table shows the average age of our owned locomotive and freight car fleets at december 31 2012  and information regarding 2012 retirements 

  

 our o ngoing locomotive and freight car maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety reliability customer satisfact ion and equipment availability      the locomotive bad order ratio includes all units owned and leased out of service for required periodic inspections unscheduled maintenance and program work which includes such activity as overha uls  

  

 

encumbrances – certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment fina ncing obligations totaling  34 million a t december 31 2012  

  

track maintenance – of the approximately 36160 total miles of track we operate we are responsib le for maintaining about 29220 miles  with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance 

  

over 81 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard     approximately 42 of our lines excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2012  

  

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding our track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 

  

 

  

microwave system – our microwave system consisting of approximately 6968 radio route miles 421 core stations 30 secondary stations and four passive repeater stations provides communications be tween most operating locations we use the microwave system primarily for voice communications vhf radio control circuits data and facsimile transmissions traffic control operations and aei data transmissions 

  

traffic control – of the approximately 16500 route miles we dispatch about 11025 miles are signalized including 8150 mile s of centralized traffic control ctc and 2875 miles of automatic block signals     of the 8150 miles of ctc approximately 5100 miles are controlled by data radio originati ng at 340 base station radio sites 

  

computers – a computer network consisting of a centralized production and backup data center near atlanta georgia and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards terminals transportation offices rolling stock repair points sales offi ces and other key system locations     operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system     computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data     in addition our computer systems assist us in the performance of a 

k 10 

  

variety of functions and services including payroll car and revenue accounting billing material managemen t activities and controls and special studies 

  

environmental matters – compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a princip al goal of ours      to date such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position results of operations  liquidity or competitive position     see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 “personal injury environmental and legal liabilities” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

employees – the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 

  

 more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”   

  

government regulation – in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generall y applicable to all business our railroads are subject to regulation by the stb     the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines     the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or ac quisition of control of and by rail common carriers     the federal railroad administration fra regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards 

  

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads following the staggers rail act of 1980 includ ed exemption from stb regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar shipments lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pu lpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing further all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from regulation for the duration of the contract about 86 of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates 

  

efforts have been made over the past several years to resubject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation  and such efforts are expected to continue in 201 3      the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially balanced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate invest in their infrastructure and compete for business thereby contributi ng to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry     accordingly we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation   

  

government regulations concerning the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “security of operations” section contained herein 

  

competition – there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers     price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerati ons especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products     even for raw materials s emifinished goods and workin progress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive producti on stages 

  

k 11 

  

our primary rail competitor is csx corporation  both railroads operate throughout much of the same territory     other railroads also operate in parts of the territory     we also compete with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who h ave the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage sourcing products from different geographic areas and using substitute products 

  

certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets   

  

security of operations – we ha ve taken significant steps to provide enhanced s ecurity for our rail system in particular we have developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001     the aar security plan defines four alert le vels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as a terrorist threat increases or decreases     the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas     1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police     although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents our system security plan outlines the protocol within our company for all concerned to be notified of aar alert level changes     all of our operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

  

our plan also effectively addresses and complies with us department of transportation dot security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials     as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and recertification programs     toward tha t end we  working closely with the national transit institute at rutgers university ha ve developed a fourmodule uniform national training program     we ha ve also worked with the transportation security administration tsa in developing other industry tr aining programs     more indepth security training has been given to select employees of ours who have been given specific security responsibilities and additional locationspecific security plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and eac h of the six port facilities we serve     with respect to the ports each facility plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and is subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

  

additionally we engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the tsa the federal bureau o f investigation fbi the fra  the us coast guard us customs and border protection and various state homeland security o ffices     as one notable example one of our police special agent s in charge sac under the auspices of the aar has been assigned to the national joint terrorism task force njttf operated by the fbi and located at the national counter terrorism center nctc in arlington v irginia to represent and serve as liaison to the north american rail industry     this arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole while having th e post filled by one of our sac s has also served to foster a strong working relationship between us and the fbi     we also ha ve become a member of the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat prog ram sponsored by us customs ctpat allows us to work closely with us customs and our customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on our railroads  particularly those moving to or from a foreign country     based on participation in ctpat we ha ve ens ured that our plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by us customs 

  

similarly we are guided in our operations by various supplemental security action items issued by dhs and dot us coast guard maritime security requirements as well as voluntary security action items developed in collaboration with tsa dot and the freight railroads many of the action items are based on lessons learned from dhs and dot security assessments of rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua  particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in htua by     1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with 

k 12 

  

federal state local and tribal governments to identify through risk assessments those locations where security risks are the highest     these action items a nd our compliance initiatives are outlined in the vario us departmental sections of our system security plan     we ha ve taken appropriate actions to be compliant with the tsa final security rule addressing rail security sensitive materials rssm to ensure t hese shipments are properly inspected and that positive chainofcustody is maintained when required     we are in compliance with the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa railrouting regulations outlined in docket hm232e     we con duct ongoing route evaluations     in 2011 as part of the fra’s biannual review this metho dology and selected routes were found to be compliant with the regulation  the next review by the fra is expected midyear 2013 

  

in 2012  th rough participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response transcaer program we provided rail accident response training to approximately 5087 emergency responders such as local police and fire pers onnel representing over 19023 hours of emergency response training     we also conducted railroad operations classes for fbi agents and the railroad liaison agents from njtt f and participated in four drills for local state and federal agencies     we also ha ve ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the security and emergency response training course conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado 

  

improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security     phmsa in coordination with the fra has amend ed the hazardous materials regulations to prescribe enhanced safety for rail transportation of tih materials has p rovided interim design standards for railroad tank cars     the rule mandates commodityspecific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured dot specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard     the i nterim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of tih tank cars   

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

we are subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial operating and environmental matters   railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry     railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has jurisdiction over some rates  routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines     the stb also has jurisdiction over the c onsolidation merger or acqui sition of control of and by rail common carriers     additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congre ss or the stb whether under new or existing laws could have a significant negative impact on our ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter     this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on our rail network or abandonment of lines 

  

railroads are subject to safet y and security regulation by dot and dhs which regulate most aspects of our operations     compliance with the rail safety improvement act of 2008 will result in additional operating costs associated with the statutorily mandated implementation of positive train control by 2015     in addition to increased capital expenditures implementation may result in reduced operational efficiency and service levels as well as increased compensation and benefits e xpenses and increased claims and litigation costs 

  

our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or groundwater supplies handlin g storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases     the risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions past present and future – is inherent in the rail road business     this risk includes property owned by us  whether currently or in the past that is or has been subject to a variety of uses including our railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or our past and present tenants 

  

environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and we could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time 

k 13 

  

with respect to one or more of these properties     moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on our financial position results of operations o r liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

a s a common carrier by rail we must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk t ransportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and pr operty damage costs and compromise critical parts of our rail network 

  

we may be affected by terrorism or war     any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interru ption and may adversely affect our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter     because we play a critical role in the nation’s transportation system we could become the target of such an attack or have a signi ficant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

  

although we currently maintain insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism we maintain only limited insurance coverage for firs tparty property damage and damage to property in our care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism     in addition premiums for some or all of our current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance co verage for certain losses could be unavailable to us in the future 

  

we may be affected by general economic conditions     prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities we carr y may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter      economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on our financial posit ion results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

we may be affected by climate change legislation or regulation     concern over climate change has led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory effo rts to limit greenhouse gas ghg emissions     moreover even without such legislation or regulation government incentives and adverse publicity relating to ghgs could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry     restrictions caps taxes or other controls on ghg emissions including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating costs decrease the amount of traffic handled and decrease the value of coal reserves we own  and thus could have an adve rse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter      such restrictions could affect our customers that 1 use commodities that we carr y to produce energy including coal 2 use significant amounts o f energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carr y  or 3 manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy 

  

we face competition from other transportation providers     we are subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and  to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of tr ansit time pricing and quality and reliability of service     while we ha ve used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain our rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities     any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in wh ich we operate or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or q uarter 

  

the operations of carriers with which we interchange may adversely affect our operations     our ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canad a depends in large part upon our ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue division car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in our inability to meet our customers’ demands or require us to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

k 14 

  

  

we rel y on technology and technology improvements in our business operations     if we experience significant disruption or failure of one or more of our information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment we could experience a service interruption a security breach or other operational difficulties  additionally if we do not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or we are unable to implement new technology we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service  any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial po sition results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

the vast majority of our employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect our operations more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions     if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown we could experience a significant disruption of our operations     additionally  future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase our costs for healthcare wages and other benefits     any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

we may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures     the nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various cl aims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters     jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employer’s liability act  fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system     the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded 

  

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a mate rial adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance     we ha ve obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages     specified levels of ris k are retained on a selfinsurance basis currently up to 50 million and above 1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and up to 25 million and above 175 million per occurrence for property owned by us or in our care custody or control     insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us  

  

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures     severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues whic h could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our o perational efficiency and ability to meet demand     workforce demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on our ability to meet demand for rail ser vice     unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidi ty in a particular year or quarter 

  

we may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of our supplier markets     we consumed about 4 60 million gallons of diesel fuel in 2012      fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations     a severe fuel supply shortage arising from production curtailments increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage to 

k 15 

  

refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position resu lts of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter     also such an event c ould impact us as well as our customers and other transportation companies 

  

due to the capital intensive nature and industryspecific requirements of the rail industry high barriers of entry exist for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment     additionally we compete with o ther industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials such as rail and ties     changes in the competitive landscapes of these limitedsupplier markets could result in increased prices or significant shor tages of materials that could have a material adverse e ffect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

  

the state of capital markets could adversely affect our liquidity     f rom timetotime we rel y on t he capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements including the issuance of longterm debt instruments and commercial paper as well as the sale of certain receivables     significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate our access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issua nce of corporate bonds     instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of our financial condition alone or in combination could also result in a reduction in our credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restr ict us from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

on november 6 2007 various antitrust class actions filed against us and other class i railroads in various federal district courts regarding fuel surcharges were consolidated in the district of columbia by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation   on june   21 2012 the court certified the case as a class action the defendant railr oads have appealed such certification and a decision by the court to either reject the appeal outright or proceed with ruling on its merits is pending we believe the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the cas es     we do not believe the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity     a lawsuit containing similar allegations against us and four other major railroads that was filed on march 25 2008 in the us district court for the district of minnesota was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff subject to a tolling agreement entered into in august 2008 

  

we received a notice of violation nov issued by the tennessee department of environmental conservation concerning soil runoff in connection with construction of the memphis regional intermodal facility in rossville tennessee although we will contest liability and the imposi tion of any penalties this matter is described here consistent with sec rules and requirements concerning governmental proceedings with respect to environmental laws and regulations we do not believe that the outcome of this proceeding will have a mater ial effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion and analy sis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

  

overview 

  

we are one of the nation’s premier transportation companies our norfolk southern railway company subsidiary operates appro ximately 20000 miles of road in 22 states and the district of columbia serves every major container port in the eastern united states and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers we op erate the most extensive intermodal network in the east and are a major transporter of coal automotive and industrial products in 2012 as part of our crescent corridor initiative we opened the new memphis regional intermodal facility in rossville tn as well as the new birmingham regional intermodal facility in mccalla al in order to position ourselves to handle increased intermodal volumes faster and more reliably 

  

financial results for 2012 were adversely affected as utili ty coal volumes declined reflecting competition from low natural gas prices and reduced electrical demand in nsserved regions in addition export coal average revenue per unit dropped a result of marketbased pricing pressure these decreases more th an offset gains in our intermodal and merchandise sectors resulting in a 1 decline in r ailway operating revenues  which more than offset the 1 reduction in railway operating expenses as a result t he railway operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses rose to 717  as compared with 712 in 2011  and net income declined 9  

  

cash provided by operating activities totaled  31 billion which along with proceeds from borrowings and cash on hand allowed for property additions share repurchases d ividend payments and debt repayments  during 2012  we repurchased 188 million shares of common stock at a total cost of  13 billion since inception of our stock repurchase program in 2006 we have repurchase d and retired 1284 million shares of common stock at a total cost of  75 billion at december 31 2012  cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled  668   million 

  

in 2013  we expect revenues to increase reflecting higher volumes     we plan to continue to focus on safety cost control increased productivity improv ed service d levels and operational efficiency and a n ongoing marketbased approach to pricing

summarized results of operations 

  

2012 compared w ith 2011 

  

net income in 2012 was  17 billion or  537 per diluted share down  167 million or 9  compared with  19   billion or  545 per diluted share in 2011      the de crease in net income was due to lower income from railway operations  l ower nonoperating income items higher interest expense on debt and a higher e ffective income tax rate note 3     railway operating revenues de creased modestly  132   m illion reflecting low er average revenue per u nit including fuel surcharges      railway operating expenses also decreased modestly 43 milli on largely driven by the absence of the 58   million unfavorable arbitration ruling in 2011 and declines related to network efficiency and productivity gains offset by higher depreciation and intermodal volumerelated expenses 

  

oil prices affect our resu lts of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period     in addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume oil prices directly affect our revenues thr ough marketbased fuel surcharges and contract escalators see “railway operating revenues” and also affect fuel costs see “railway operating expenses”     for 2012  excluding the impact of de creased consumption the increase in fue l surcharge revenue was less than the increase in fuel expense     future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter 

  

2011 compared with 2010 

  

net income in 2011 was  19 billion or  545 per diluted share up  420 million or 28  compared with 

 15 billion or  400 per diluted share in 2010      the increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations and a lower effective tax rate note 3     railway operating r evenues increased  17   billion reflecting higher average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges  and higher volumes  railway operating expenses increased  11 billion primarily due to higher fuel pr ices and volume related expenses  

  

detailed results of operations 

  

railway operati ng revenues 

  

railway operating revenues were  110 billion in 2012   112 billion in 2011  and  95 billion in 2010      the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes and average revenue per un it by market group 

  

     

k 21   

revenues de creased  132 m illion in 2012  but increased  17 billion in 2011      as reflected in the table below the de crease in 2012 was due to lower average revenue per unit  as the negative effects of changes in the mix of traffi c offset rate increases and slightly higher fuel surcharges  and slightly lower volume      the increase in 2011 was due to higher average revenue per unit which was driven by rate increases and higher fuel surcharges offset in part b y the effects of changes in the mix of business and increased volumes      fuel surcharge revenue increased  23 m illion in 2012 and  531 million in 2011  and totaled 13 billion in both years      if fuel prices remain at or near yearend 2012 levels fuel surcharge revenue will be lower in 2013 

 

many of our negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise shipments are based on the monthly average price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti average price these surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the wti average price for the second preceding calendar month this twomonth lag in applying wti average price increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 39 million in 2012 but decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 44 million in 2011 and 28 million in 2010 

  

   

for 2012  the un favorable revenue per unit variance accounted for 91  of the total revenue s de crease reflecting the negative effect of changes in the mix of business offset in part by higher rates  the slightly unfavorable volume variance was a reflection of lower coal paperclayforest products and agricultureconsumer productsgovernment shipments which offset gains in the automotive intermodal chemicals and metalsconstruction commodity g roups 

  

in 2011  the favorable revenue per unit variance accounted for 70 of the total revenues increase reflecting higher rates and increased fuel surcharges offset in part by t he effects of changes in mix      the favorable volu me variance reflected increases for all commodity groups  except chemicals agricultureconsumer productsgovernment and paperclayforest products  driven primarily by increased consumer demand 

  

one of our customers dupont has a rate reasonableness co mplaint pending before the stb alleging that our tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable     we dispute th i s allegation  since june 1 2009 we ha ve been billing and collecting from dupont amounts based on the challenged tari ff rates     we presently expect resolution of the dupont case to occur in 201 4 and believe the estimate of reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity     with regard to rate cases w e record adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and estimable 

  

coal revenues de creased  579 million or 17  compared with 2011  reflecting a 13 de crease in carload volume primarily due to fewer shipments of utility coal coal average revenue per unit was down 5  the result of lower pricing mainly marketbased export metallurgical coal and decreased fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by the positive effect of changes in mix 

  

in 2011  coal revenues increased  739 million or 27  compared with 2010  reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a 4 increase in volume principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production     coal average reve nue per unit was up 22 compared with 2010  reflecting improved pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue 

  

for 2013  coal revenues are expected to de crease due to lower average reven ue per unit driven by continued marketbased pricing pressure in the export coal market coal carload volumes are also anticipated to be lower in 2013   

k 22   

coal represented 26 of our revenues in 2012 and 80 of shipments handled originated on our lines     as shown i n the following table tonnage de creased in each coal market 

  

   

utility coal tonnage dropped 17 in 2012  reflecting competition from low natural gas prices and reduced electrical demand in nsserved regions additional tonnage declines resulted from coal plant closures and plant maintenance 

  

in 2011  utility coal tonnage improved a mo dest 1  primarily a result of new business and the resumption in the first quarter of shipments to electrical generation units that had been i dled in 2009     these increases were tempered by the effects of increased natural gas generation due to low natura l gas prices  reduced electrical demand in ns  served regions and severe weather disruptions in 2011 

  

for 2013  we expect utility coal tonnage to de cre ase reflecting the effects of plant closures continued low natural gas prices and higherthannormal utility stockpiles 

  

export coal tonnage de creased 1 compared to 2011  a reflection of weaker global demand for metallurgical coal used in steel production in nsserved markets in addition to the negative impact of the return of australian supply offset in part by increased thermal shipments tonnage handled through norf olk was down 13 million tons or 6  whereas tonnage through baltimore increased 03 million tons or 4  other export tonnage handled increased 08 million tons  

  

in 2011  export coal tonnage increased 25 compared with 2010  reflecting increased global demand for coal used in steel production and tightened supply from australia due to flo oding in the first half of 2011 tonnage handled through norfolk was up 47 million tons or 30  and baltimore tonnage handled increased 08 million tons or 1 1  

  

for 2013  export coal tonnage is expected to decrease as a result of sluggish demand from europe partially offset by improvement in asia beginning in the second half of 2013 

  

domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was down 5 in 2012  c ompared with 2011  as declines in coke and iron ore shipments primarily due to a plant closure offset improved domestic steel production experienced in the first half of 2012 

  

d omestic metallurgical coal tonnage was flat in 2011 compared with 2010 

  

for 2013  domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to decrease as domestic steel production continues to decelerate 

  

k 23 

  

industrial coal tonnage de creased 4 in 2012  compared with 2011  as weak industrial demand was partially offset by new business  

  

in 2011  industrial coal tonnage increased 2 compared to 2010  as new business completely offset the impact of tight coal supply and network delays experienced in the early part of the year 

  

for 2013  new business is expected to drive incr eases in industrial coal tonnage 

  

general merchandise revenues in 2012 increased  336 million or 6  compared with 2011  reflecting a 4 rise in average revenue per unit as a result of higher rates and fuel surcharges     carload volume increased 2  

  

in 2011  general merchandi se revenues increased  583 million or 12  compared with 2010  reflecting a n 11 rise in average revenue per unit as a result of higher rates and fuel surcharges overall carload vol ume was relatively flat 

  

chemicals revenues in 2012 increased 7  compared with 2011  reflecting 4 growth in volume and a 3 increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from higher rates and fuel surcharges  the volume improvement was primarily the result of more carloads of crude oil from the bakken and canadian oil fields additionally there were more carloads of li quefied petroleum gas as well as higher shipments of plastics driven by greater demand for plastic bottles these increases were offset in part by fewer shipments of rock salt as a mild winter resulted in higher inventory levels throughout 2012  

  

in 2011  chemicals revenue s grew 5  compared with 2010  as a 14 increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from higher rates and fuel surcharges more th an offset the effects of an 8 decrease in volume the decline in volume was primarily a result of reduced shipments of fly ash due to the completion of the tennessee valley authority ash project in the fourth quarter of 2010 

  

for 2013  chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as a result of higher shipments of crude oil as well as more carloads of plastics linked to the projected resurgence of the housing market and continued growth in the automoti ve market additionally average revenue per unit is expected to be higher 

  

agriculture consumer products and government revenues were relatively flat in 2012  compared with 2011  as higher average revenue per unit was offset by lower volume the volume decline was driven by reduced corn shipments due to plant closures fewer carloads of fertilizer led by certain network classification changes and reduced shipments of wheat to the eastern us due to customer sourcing changes these volume declines were offset in part by more shipments of soybean and soybean meal due to a poor south american bean crop as well as higher shipments of cornbased feed to texas 

  

in 2011  agricult ure consumer products and government revenues increased 9  compared with 2010  the result of a 14 i mprovement in average revenue per unit  which reflected higher rates and fuel surc harges volume declined 5 as a result of fewer shipments of fertilizer due to certain network classification changes and reduced shipments of corn to the midwest due to the impact of a healthier midwest crop 

  

for 2013  agr iculture consumer products and government revenues are expected to improve as a result of higher average revenue per unit offset in part by a decrease in volume the projected decline in volume is primarily due to fewer shipments of feed and corn as a r esult of the negative impact of the 2012 midwest drought in addition to fewer revenue movements of empty equipment which is expected to be offset in part by more fertilizer carloads  

  

metals and construction revenues increased 8 in 2012  compared with 2011      the revenue improvement resulted from 7 higher average reve nue per unit which reflected higher rates and fuel surcharges v olume improved 1  reflecting more coil steel shipments driven by increased automotive production the mild winter weather experienced in early and late 2012 led to more shipments of cement for construction projects there were also higher shipments of fractio nating sand for natural gas drilling these increases were partially offset by fewer 

k 24 

  

aggregates carloads primarily driven by weak market conditions in roadhighway construction and as lower coal utility burn led to fewer shipments of scrubber stone 

  

in 2011  metals and construction revenues increased 23  compared with 2010  the improvement resulted from 16 growth in average revenue per unit  which reflected higher rates and fuel surcharges volume improved 6  reflecting increased automotive production that led to more shipments of coil steel and more carloads of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling 

  

for 2013  metals and construction revenues are expected to increase reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a modest increase in volume due to more shipments of fractionating sand and other materials as a result of expected growth in the natural gas drilling sector 

  

automotive revenues rose 15  compared to 2011  reflecting 13 growth in volume due to increased north american light vehicle production at nsserved plants and a 2 improvement in average revenue pe r unit including fuel surcharges  

  

in 2011  automotive revenues rose 20  compared to 2010  reflecting a 14 rise in volume d ue to increased domestic production of north american light vehicles and a 5 improvement in average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and higher fuel surcharges 

  

for 2013  automotive revenues are expected to grow as a result of volume gains driven by a continued increase in domestic production of north american light vehicles at nsserved plants in addition to slightly higher average revenue per unit 

  

paper clay and forest products revenues increased 3 in 2012  compared with 2011  reflecting a 5 improvement in average revenue per unit due to increased rates which more than offset the effects of a 3 v olume decline     the lower volume was due to reduced shipments of miscellaneous wood driven by the loss of business and fewer carloads of pulp as a result of declining export market demand 

  

in 2011  paper clay and forest products revenues increased 6  compared with 2010  reflecting an 11 improvement in average revenue per unit due to higher rates and fuel surcharges which more than offset the effec ts of a 4 volume decline the lower volume was principally due to fewer shipments of wood chips as drier weather in the southeast prompted customer sourcing changes in addition to the closure of a plant in the third quarter of 2011 reduced shipments o f kaolin and newsprint associated with lower demand and the loss of some lowerrated business also impacted the year 

 

for 2013  paper clay and forest produ cts revenues are expected to increase reflecting higher volumes of lumber as housing starts continue to improve in addition to higher average revenue per unit  

  

intermodal revenues increased  111 million or 5  c ompared with 2011  reflecting 5 growth in volume largely due to increased domestic units resulting from continued highwaytorail conversions average revenue per unit improved 1 as a result of higher fuel surcharges partially offset by lower pricing      

  

domestic volume which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies  increased 11  reflecting continued highway conversions 

  

p remium business which includes parcel and lessthantruckload ltl carriers rose 1  as a result of stronger market demand and new business 

  

i nternational traffic volume fell 1  as the loss of business from a shipping li ne was partially offset by growth across remaining international customers 

  

t riple crown services triple crown a service with railtohighway trailers experienced a 1 volume decline reflecting the elimination of some lowerma rgin business 

k 25 

  

  

in 2011  intermodal revenues increased  334 million or 19  compared with 2010  reflecting 10 growth in volume and a n 8 improvement in average revenue per unit as a result of higher fuel surcharges and rates     in 2011  all intermodal segments experienced volume increases reflecting a steadily improving economy as well as tight truck capacity      domestic volume increased 15  international volume improved 5  premium business rose 9  and triple crown grew 1  

  

for 2013  interm odal revenues are exp ected to increase due to higher v olume and average revenue per unit as a result of stronger market demand due to continued highway conversions  

  

railway operating expenses 

  

railway operating expenses in 2012 were  79 billion down  43 m illion or 1 compared to 2011      expenses in 2011 were  80 billion up  11 billion  or 16 compared to 2010      the de crease in 2012 reflected the absence of last year’s 58   million unfavorable arbitration ruling and lower equipment rents due to gains in network efficiency these favorable decreases were offset in part by higher depreciation expense which resulted from an increased capital base  in addition to higher purchased services the increase in 2011 w as prim arily due to higher fuel prices increased volumerelated expenses and the unfavorable arbitration ruling     

  

the following table shows the changes in railw ay operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

  

 materials and other expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damag e and environmental matters de creased  65 million or 7  in 2012  but increased  167 million or 22  in 2011  as shown in the following table 

  

   

the de crease in 2012 reflected the absence of the prior year’s unfavorable arbitration ruling discussed below and more favorable personal injury claims development for prior years’ claims 34   million these favorable items were partially offset by higher costs associated with property taxes and environmental remediation 

  

k 26 

  

the increase in 2011 reflected the unfavorable arbitration ruling and higher costs associated with locomotive and railcar materials taxes primarily sales and use property and excise employee travel and supply costs as well as less favorable personal injury claims development 

  

the consolidated balance sheets reflect longterm receivables for estimated recoveries from our insurance carriers for claims associate d with the january 6 2005 derailment in graniteville sc in the first quarter of 2011 we received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier and w ere denied recovery of the contested portion of the claim     as a result w e recorded a 43 million charge for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a 15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery was no longer probable     

  

the largest component of casualties a nd other claims expense is personal injury costs     cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 40 of total employee injury cases resolved and about 25 of total employee injury payments made     with our longestablished commitment to safety we continue to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and reduce the associated costs     with respect to occupational injuries which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly re sult from a claimed exposure over time the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately     the majority of these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades     the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers’ liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads     fela’s faultbased system which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers’ compensation system 

  

we maintain substantial amounts of insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims     we also retain reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance  note 16 

  

compensation and benefits  which represents 37 of total operating expenses de creased  14 million in 2012  reflecting changes in  

•   employee activity levels  down  40 million 

•   incentive and stockbased compensation  down  35 million 

•   pay rates up  4 3 million and 

•   pension and postretirement benefit costs up 1 6 million 

  

in 2011  compensation and benefits increased  266 million or 10  compared with 201 0  primarily due to higher 

•   agreement employee activity levels associated with increased volumes up 70 million 

•   health and welfare benefit costs for agreement employees up 50 million 

•   incentive compensation up 39 million 

•   payroll taxes up 37 million 

•   pension benefit costs up 19 million and 

•   wage rates up 16 million 

  

our employment averaged 30943 in 2012  compared with 30329 in 2011  and 28559 in 2010      the 2012 increase was a result of additional mechanical and maintenance of way personnel to support field operations looking forward to 201 3  we expect employment levels to be lower than 2012 as we continue to benefit from productivity increases and operational efficiencies      we also expect increased compensation and benefits costs as a result of higher wage rates  

  

fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fue l used in railway operations de creased  12 million or 1  in 2012  but increased  510 million or 47  in 2011      the decline in 2012 was principally the result of lower fuel consumption locomotive fuel consumption declined 3   which had an impact of  52 million offset in part by higher fuel prices locomotive fuel prices rose 3   which had an impact of  40   million 

k 27 

  

  

the increase in 2011 reflected higher fuel prices locomotive fuel prices increased 37   which had an effect of  431 million as well as increased fuel consumption locomotive fu el consumption rose 8   which had an effect of  79 million 

  

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rental s     this category of expenses decreased  6 million in 2012  but increased  133 million or 9  in 2011  

  

   

the increase in 2012 for p urchased services costs reflected higher professional and consulting fees intermodal operations expenses conrailrelated casualty costs 15 million and advertising expenses these increases were partially offset by lo wer haulage expenses the increase in 2011 was principally driven by higher costs associated with greater volumes 

  

e quipment rents which includes our cost of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or pri vate owners less the rent paid to us for the use of our equipment decreased in 2012 as a result of increased velocity and improved equipment utilization whereas the increase in 2011 w as principally due to hig her traffic volumes 

  

depreciation expense grew  54 million or 6  in 2012  and  43 million or 5  in 2011      the se increase s reflect our larger roadway and equipment capital base as we continue to invest in our infrastructure and rolling stock  

  

other income – net 

  

other income – n et was  129 million in 2012   160 million in 2011  and  153 million in 2010  note 2     the decline in 2012 reflected fewer gains on the sale of property decreased coal royalties and higher interest expense net on uncertain tax positions offset in part by higher net returns from corporateowned life insurance coli increased equity in the earnings of conrail and higher rental income during the fourth quarter of 2012 we closed on the sale of certain assets to the michigan department of transportation the associated gain on the sale has been deferred until we cease to have ongoin g obligations associated with the assets which is expected to occur within the next 12   months 

  

the increase in 201 1 reflected reduced interest expense  net on uncertain tax positions higher net coli returns  and increase d coal royalties      the increases were offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property and increased professional and legal fees associated with the third quarter debt exchange and the fourth quarter credit facility renewal up 7   million      

  

  

k 28 

  

income taxes 

  

income tax expense in 2012 was  1 billion an effective rate of 37  compared with 34 in 2011 and 37  in 2010      the increase in the rate for 2012 primarily reflects the absence of the prior year’s favorable resolution of the internal revenue service irs examination of our 2008 return and review of cer tain claims for refund 40   million and the absence of a favorable reduction in deferred tax expense for state law changes 28   million the decrease in the rate for 2011 was primarily due to the favorable adjustments discussed ab ove and the absence of a 2010 charge to deferred tax expense 27 million due to a change in the tax law impacting the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program     these decreases were offset in part by the absence of a 2010 34 million benefit resultin g from a change in estimate for deferred taxes  

  

fiftypercent bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2010 in december 2010 the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act increased bonus depreciation to 100 percent for the period september 2010 through the end of 2011 and allowed fiftypercent bonus depreciation in 2012 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 which was signed into law on january   2   2013 extended fiftypercent bonus depreciation for a n additional year while bonus depreciation does not affect our total provision for income taxes or effective rate the absence of bonus depreciation after 2013 is expected to increase current income tax expense and the related cash outflows for the payme nt of income taxes beginning in 2014 the american taxpayer relief act also reinstated certain business tax credits retroactively to january 1 2012 the effects of changes in tax laws including retroactive changes are recognized in the period in which the changes are enacted accordingly we expect to recognize approximately 9   million of income tax benefits in the first quarter of 2013 for these tax law changes 

  

irs examinations have been completed for all years prior to 2011 we expect the irs wil l begin auditing our 2011 and 2012 consolidated income tax returns in late 2013 

  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash provided by operating activities our principal source of liquidity was  31 billion in 2012 compared with  32 billion in 2011 and  27 billion in 2010      the decline in 2012 reflects increased tax payments driven by reduced bonus depreciation in addition to lower operating results      the increase in 2011 reflected better operating results and lower income taxes paid due to additional bonus depreciation  we had working capital of  161 million at december 31 2012  compared with  50 million at december 31 2011  primarily reflecting a higher cash balance as a result of new debt issued and lower share repurchase activity in 2012      c ash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances totaled  668 million and  301 million at december   31   2012 and 2011  respectively and w ere invested in accordance with our corporate investment policy as approved by the board of directors     the portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk     there ar e no limits or restrictions on our access to these assets     we expect cash on hand co mbined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations

cash used in investing activities was  20 billion in 2012  compared with  18 billion in 2011  and 15   billion in 2010      the increase in 2012 primarily reflects a decrease in investment sales net of purchases and increased property additions that were offset in part by proceeds from property sales      the 2011 increase resulted from higher property additions offset in part by a dec rease in investment purchases 

  

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category     the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and trac k and equipment statistics for the past five years

for 2013  we b udgeted  20 billion for property additions     the anticipated spending includes  831 million for the normalized replacement of rail ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges     planned equipment spending of  420 million includes new and rebuilt locomotives rebodying of coal cars intermodal containers and chassis and multilevel automobile racks     investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be  203 million and in clude intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network  including the crescent corridor initiative  mechanical service shops and bulk transfer facilit ies      we budgeted 2 29 million for the continued implementation of positive t rain control ptc and expect additional ptcrelated property additions of at least  674 million in 2014 and 2015     we also expect to spend  8 4 million on infrastructure improvements to increase mainli ne capacity accommodate business growth and provide ou r share of funding for various publicprivate partnership investments such as crescent corridor and the chicago create project  technology investments of  57 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers 

  

the crescent corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless highcapacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from new jersey to louisiana and offering truckcompetitive serv ice along several major interstate highway corridors including i81 i85 i20 

i40 i59 i78 and i75     based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief we plan to implement certain elements of the cre scent corridor through a series of publicprivate partnerships     currently the crescent corridor has received or expects to receive a total of  295 million in public capital funding commitments from the commonwealths of pennsylv ania and virginia the s tate of tennessee the federal tiger stimulus program and other federal funding sources related to projects in alabama pennsylvania tennessee and north carolina     with respect to the private funding component we currently antici pate spending up to  300 million for the substantial completion of work on these projects which is expected in 2014     planned 2013 investments for the crescent corridor approximate  42 million

during 2012 we issued 

•   600 million of 300 senior notes due 2022 

•   600 million of 395 senior notes due 2042 and

our debttototal capitalization ratio was 471 at december 31 2012  compared with 43 2 at december 31 2011  

  

as of december 31 2012  we had authority from our board of directors to issue an additional  600 m illion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale     we have on file with the sec a form s3 automatic shelf registration statement for wellknown seasoned issuers under which securities may be issued pursuant to this authority 

  

we also have in place and available a 750 million fiveyear cr edit agreement expiring in 2016  which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants     we had no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2012 and are in compliance with all of its covenants     in october 201 2  we renewed our 350   million accounts receivable securitization program with a 364day term to run until october 201 3      there was  300 million outstanding under this prog ram at december 31 2012 and  200 million outstanding at december 31 2011  note 8 

  

upcoming annual debt maturities are relatively mo dest note 8     overall our goal is to maintain a capital structure with app ropriate leverage to support our business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

  

application of critical accounting estimates 

  

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us g enerally a ccepted a ccounting p rinciples gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reportin g period     these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require us to make changes to these estimates and assumptions     accordingly we regularl y review these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances     we regularly discuss the development selection and disclosures concernin g critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires us to make several estimates and assumptions note 11     these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality     in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value     we make these estimates based on our historical experience and ot her information that we deem pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock marke t performance     we utilize an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist us in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing rela ted liabilities 

k 32 

  

net pension expense which is included in “compensation and benefits” in the consolidated statements of income was  60 million for 2012      in recording this amount we assumed a longterm i nvestment rate of return of 825  which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception     a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a  17 million change in pension expense and as a result an equal change in “compensation and benefits” expense     changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be e xpected to have a material effect on our net pension expense or net pension liability in the future     the net pension liability is recorded at net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the ti ming of expected benefit payments     we utilize analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds     we use the r esults of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans 

  

net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was  107   million for 2012      in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits we estimated future increases in healthcare costs     these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage poi nt change in them are described in note   11 

  

properties and depreciation 

  

most of our total assets are longlived railway properties note 6     as disclosed in note 1 properties are deprecia ted using group depreciation     the primary depreciation method for our asset base is group life     units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources     remaining properties a re depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives 

  

d epreciation expense is based on assumptions concerning expected service lives of properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be rece ived upon their retirement     in developing these assumptions we utilize periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the stb      d epreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property     the frequency of these studies correlates with guidelines established by the stb 

  

key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include 

•   statistical analyses of historical retirement data and surviving asset records 

•   review of historical salvage received and current market rates 

•   review of our operations including expected changes in technology customer demand maintenance practices and asset management strategies 

•   review of accounting policies and assumptions and 

•   industry review and analysis 

  

the units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors     our experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors     in developing the respective depreciation rate consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age weight condition new or second hand and type curve or straight     as a result a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base 

  

r ecent experience with these studies has been that while t hey do result in changes in depreciation rates  these changes have not ca used a significant effect to a nnual depreciation expense     changes in rates as a result of depreciation studies are implemented prospectively     these studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by th e study     any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class 

k 33 

  

of property a s determined by the study d epreciation expense for 2012 totaled  916 million     our composite depreciation rates for 2012 are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a  33 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense     for 2012  roadway depreciation rates ranged from 083 to 333 and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 132 to 3784  

  

when properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business the cost of the assets net of sale proceeds or salvage is charged to accumulat ed depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings     actual historical cost values are retired when available such as with equipment assets     the use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs     when retiring rail ties and ballast we use statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired     the historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the us bureau of labor statistics     the indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets     these indices are used because they close ly correlate with the costs of roadway assets gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in “other income – net” note 2 since such income is not a product of our railroad operations 

  

a retirement is considered abnormal if it d oes not occur in the normal course of business if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates     gains or losses from abnormal retirements would be recognized in earnings however there were no such gains or losses in 2012  2 011  or 2010  

  

we review the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscount ed cash flow     assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review would be recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value  however there were no such impairments in 2012  2011  or 2010  

  

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

  

c asualties and other claims expense  included in “materials and other” total ed  130 million in 2012  typically most of this expense relates to our accrual for personal injury liabilities     jobrelated personal injury and occupa tional claims are subject to fela which is applicable only to railroads     fela’s faultbased to rt system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system     the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded     in all cas es we record a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable 

  

to aid in valuing personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period we utilize studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm     for employee personal injury cases the actu arial firm studies our historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences  we estimate the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for inc urred but unasserted claims based on the results of this analysis     for occupational injury claims  the actuarial firm studies our history of claim filings severity payments an d other relevant facts     additionally our estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting our experience into the future as far as can be reasonably deter mined   we have recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves  as well as our and the actuarial firm’s judgments in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which we would recognize wh en such a change became known w hile the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study it is possible that the ult imate liability could be higher or lower   the operating expenses for personal injury claims totaled  54 million in 2012  88   million in 2011 and  75   million in 2010 

  

we are subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations     we record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably note 16     claims if any against third 

k 34 

  

parties for recovery of cleanup cost s we’ve incurred are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the consolidated balance sheets and are not n etted against the associated l iability   environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites an d in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates     we ha ve an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret our environmental policy 

  

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled  40 million in 2012   32 million in 2011  and  26 million in 2010  and property additions for environmental matters tot aled  6 million in 2012   7 million in 2011  and  8   million in 2010      property additions for environmental matters in 2013 are expected to be about  8 million 

  

our cons olidated balance sheets include liabilities for environmental exposures of  42 million at december 31 2012  and  35 million at december 31 2011 of which  12 million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period     at december 31 2012  the liability represents our estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 146 known locations and projects     as of that date nine sites acc ounted for  23 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material     we anticipate that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period  

  

at 22 locations one or more of our subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liabilit y act of 1980 or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs     we calculate our estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potent ial for joint liability 

  

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by us or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of our ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss and that participant’s ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liabil ity     we estimate our environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments we dee m appropriate for each site     as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these ma ny assumptions and judgments     we ha ve consistently applied our methodology of estimating our environmental liabilities 

  

based on the assessment of facts and circumstances now known we believe we have recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which we are aware     further we believe that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

we andor certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations     when we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to e arnings      while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on futu re developments in our opinion the recorded liability is adequate to cover the fut ure payment of such liability and claims     however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter     any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

  

k 35 

  

income taxes 

  

our net longterm deferred tax liability totaled  78 billion at december 31 2012  note 3     this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements     after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns     for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation all owance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized we had a  19   million valuation al lowance on  10 b illion of deferred tax assets as of december 3 1 2012  r eflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized 

  

in addition we ha ve a recorded liability for our estimat e of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return     judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examinat ion and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority     we believe this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate     income tax expense is adju sted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded     for every one half percent change in the 2012 effective tax rate net income would have chang ed by  14 million 

  

other matters 

  

labor agreements 

  

more than 80 of our railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act rla     we largely bargain nationally in concert with other major railroads re presented by the national carriers conference committee nccc moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes 

  

the nccc has concluded the round of bargaining that began in november 2009 and reached national agreements with all applicable labor unions although we previously concluded separate agreements with each of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet and the american train dispatchers association atda that extend through d ecember 31 2014 the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements apply to the blet and atda we bargain separately with our ashtabula ohio docks longshoremen who are represented by the international longshoremen’s association ila and do not participate in national bargaining we and the ila have also reached agreement with moratorium provisions consistent with the moratorium provisions of the national agreements 

  

m arket risks 

  

we manage overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments at december 31 2012  debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled  300 million a onepercentage point increase in interest rates would increase total annual interest expense related to all variable debt by approximately  3 million we consider it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations ap plicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

inflation 

  

in preparing financial statements gaap require s the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property     as a capitalintensive company we have most of our capital invested in such property     the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost

internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting includes t hose policies and procedures that pertain to our ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data     we recognize that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including t he possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control     accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation     further b ecause of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time 

  

in order to ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective we regularly assess such controls and did so most recently for our financial reporting at december 31 2012      this assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the committee of s ponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework      based on our assessment we have concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting at december 31 2012  

  

our board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of our accounting policies financial reporting and internal control     the audit committee of our board of directors is comprised entirely of outside directo rs who are independent of management     the independent registere d public accounting firm and our internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data

overview 

with global and domestic economies reflecting pentup demand ns’ net income grew for the second consecutive year ns’ 2011 net income rose 28 as a result of a 20 increase in income from railway operations and a lower effective income tax rate railway operating revenues increased 17 as a result of higher average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges and increased traffic volume railway operating expenses increased 16 reflecting higher fuel prices and increased traffic volume the railway operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses improved to 712 as compared with 719 in 2010 

cash provided by operating activities totaled 32 billion which along with cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings allowed for property additions share repurchases debt repayments and dividend payments during 2011 302 million shares of common stock were repurchased at a total cost of 21 billion since inception of the stock repurchase program in 2006 ns has repurchased and retired 1096 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 62 billion at december 31 2011 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 301 million

looking forward to 2012 ns expects revenues to increase reflecting higher traffic volumes but at a more moderate pace than seen in 2011 given the slowgrowing economy and higher average revenue per unit that will meet or slightly exceed the rate of rail inflation ns plans to continue to focus on safety improving service levels and operational efficiency and maintaining a marketbased approach to pricing 

summarized results of operations 

2011 compared with 2010 

net income in 2011 was 19 billion or 545 per diluted share up 420 million or 28 compared with 15 billion or 400 per diluted share in 2010 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations and a lower effective tax rate see note 3 railway operating revenues increased 17 billion reflecting higher average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges and higher traffic volumes railway operating expenses increased 11 billion principally due to higher fuel prices and volumerelated expenses 

oil prices affect ns’ results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period in addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume oil prices directly affect ns’ revenues through marketbased fuel surcharges and contract escalators see “railway operating revenues” and also affect fuel costs see “railway operating expenses” for 2011 excluding the impact of increased consumption the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was greater than the increase in fuel expense future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter 

2010 compared with 2009 

net income in 2010 was 15 billion or 400 per diluted share up 462 million or 45 compared with 10 billion or 276 per diluted share in 2009 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes see note 3 railway operating revenues increased 15 billion reflecting higher traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges railway operating expenses increased 833 million primarily due to higher volumerelated expenses and fuel prices 

k19 detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

railway operating revenues were 112 billion in 2011 95 billion in 2010 and 80 billion in 2009 the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes and average revenue per unit by market group 

 revenues increased 17 billion in 2011 and 15 billion in 2010 as reflected in the table below the increase in 2011 was due to higher average revenue per unit which was driven by rate increases and higher fuel surcharges offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic and increased traffic volumes the increase in 2010 was due to increased traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit which was driven by higher fuel surcharges and rate increases offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic fuel surcharge revenue amounted to 13 billion in 2011 compared with 724 million in 2010 and 370 million in 2009 if fuel prices remain at or near yearend 2011 levels fuel surcharge revenue will be higher in 2012 

many of ns’ negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise traffic are based on the monthly average price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti average price these surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the wti average price for the second preceding calendar month this twomonth lag in applying wti average price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 44 million in 2011 28 million in 2010 and 50 million in 2009 

 k20 for 2011 the favorable revenue per unit variance accounted for 70 of the total revenues increase reflecting higher rates and increased fuel surcharges offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic the favorable volume variance reflected increases for all commodity groups except chemicals agricultureconsumer productsgovernment and paperclayforest products driven primarily by increased consumer demand

in 2010 the favorable volume variance accounted for 70 of the total revenues increase reflecting traffic volume improvements in all commodity groups volumes increased by 806800 units or 14 reflecting the strengthening of the economy the favorable revenue per unit variance reflected increased fuel surcharges and higher rates offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic 

two of ns’ customers dupont and south mississippi electric power association smepa filed rate reasonableness complaints at the surface transportation board stb alleging that the ns tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable ns disputes these allegations however in august 2011 ns agreed to settle the rate reasonableness complaint with smepa settlement of this claim did not have a material effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity since june 1 2009 in the case of dupont ns has been billing and collecting amounts based on the challenged tariff rates management presently expects resolution of the dupont case to occur in 2013 and believes the estimate of reasonably possible loss will not have a material effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity with regard to rate cases management records adjustments to revenues in the periods if and when such adjustments are probable and estimable

coal revenues increased 739 million or 27 compared with 2010 reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a 4 increase in volume principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production coal average revenue per unit was up 22 reflecting improved pricing and increased fuel surcharge revenue

in 2010 coal revenues increased 455 million or 20 compared with 2009 reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a 10 increase in volume principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production coal average revenue per unit was up 9 compared with 2009 reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and improved pricing 

for 2012 coal revenues are expected to increase due to higher average revenue per unit driven by pricing improvement in addition to increased volumes as a result of more shipments of export coal 

coal represented 31 of ns’ revenues in 2011 and 80 of shipments handled originated on ns’ lines as shown in the following table tonnage increased in three of the four coal markets 

 utility coal tonnage improved a modest 1 in 2011 primarily a result of new business and the resumption in the first quarter of shipments to electrical generation units that had been idled since the first quarter of 2009 these increases were tempered by the effects of increased natural gas generation due to low natural gas prices reduced electrical demand in ns served regions and severe weather disruptions in 2011 

k21 in 2010 utility coal tonnage improved slightly as residential demand increased due to severe winter weather and above average summer temperatures on the east coast additionally electricity demand in the industrial sector was higher these increases more than offset the effects of low natural gas prices and the diversion of utility coal to the export market

for 2012 we expect utility coal tonnage to decrease as new business gains will be more than offset by the effects of reduced electricity demand as a result of very mild winter weather conditions and low natural gas prices 

export coal tonnage increased 25 compared to 2010 reflecting increased global demand for coal used in steel production and tightened supply from australia due to flooding in the first half of 2011 tonnage handled through norfolk was up 47 million tons or 30 and baltimore tonnage handled increased 08 million tons or 11 

in 2010 export coal tonnage increased 27 compared with 2009 reflecting increased global demand for coal used in steel production tonnage handled through norfolk was up 13 million tons or 9 and baltimore tonnage handled increased 35 million tons or 97 

for 2012 export coal tonnage is expected to increase due to port capacity improvement projects new coal production driven by planned mine expansions and worldwide demand and new steam coal opportunities to europe and asia 

domestic metallurgical coal tonnage was flat in 2011 compared with 2010 

in 2010 domestic metallurgical coal tonnage increased 67 compared with 2009 as domestic steel production improved due to an increase in steel demand as blast furnaces resumed operations 

for 2012 domestic metallurgical coal tonnage is expected to decrease as greater coking coal availability in the second half of 2011 led to inventory replenishment in late 2011 and anticipated lesser 2012 demand for domestic metallurgical coal 

industrial coal tonnage increased 2 in 2011 compared with 2010 as new business completely offset the impact of tight coal supply and network delays experienced in the early part of the year

in 2010 industrial coal tonnage increased 1 compared to 2009 primarily due to new business and increased demand in the steel market 

for 2012 new business is expected to drive increases in industrial coal tonnage 

general merchandise revenues in 2011 increased 583 million or 12 compared with 2010 reflecting an 11 rise in average revenue per unit as a result of higher rates and increased fuel surcharges overall traffic volume was relatively flat 

in 2010 general merchandise revenues increased 826 million or 20 compared with 2009 reflecting a 14 increase in traffic volume and a 5 improvement in average revenue per unit reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and higher rates 

agriculture consumer products and government revenues increased 9 in 2011 compared with 2010 the result of 14 higher average revenue per unit which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharges traffic volume declined 5 as a result of fewer shipments of fertilizer due to certain network classification changes and reduced shipments of corn to the midwest due to the impact of a healthier midwest crop 

in 2010 agriculture consumer products and government revenues increased 12 compared with 2009 due to an 11 increase in traffic volume and a 1 increase in average revenue per unit the increase in traffic volume was a result of more shipments of sweeteners and corn due to continued strength in the demand for ethanol higher fertilizer volumes due to farmers replenishing nutrients to meet increased crop demand and increased feed volumes due to a strong export market

for 2012 agriculture consumer products and government revenues are expected to improve as a result of increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit reflecting projected growth driven by gains in the ethanol market in addition to more feed product and corn shipments due to slightly improved demand for animal feed 

k22 chemicals revenues in 2011 increased 5 compared with 2010 as a 14 increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from increased rates and higher fuel surcharges more than offset the effects of an 8 decrease in traffic volume the decline in volume was primarily a result of reduced shipments of fly ash due to the completion of the tennessee valley authority ash project in the fourth quarter of 2010

in 2010 chemicals revenue increased 23 compared with 2009 due to an 18 increase in traffic volume and a 5 growth in average revenue per unit reflecting higher rates and increased fuel surcharges volume gains reflected new business of fly ash in addition to higher shipments of petroleum industrial intermediates plastics and miscellaneous chemicals resulting from improvements in the economy

for 2012 chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as a result of higher shipments of crude oil from the midwest destined for eastern refineries and more carloads of liquefied petroleum gas as a previously idled refinery restarts improvements in the economy are also expected to generate higher plastic volumes additionally average revenue per unit is expected to be higher

metals and construction revenues increased 23 in 2011 compared with 2010 the revenue improvement resulted from 16 higher average revenue per unit which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharges traffic volume improved 6 reflecting increased automotive production that led to more shipments of coil steel and more shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling

in 2010 metals and construction revenues increased 36 reflecting a 25 increase in traffic volume and a 9 increase in average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and increased fuel surcharges the increase in traffic volume was principally due to more shipments of coil iron and steel and scrap metal due to increased steel and automotive production as well as higher shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling

for 2012 metals and construction revenues are expected to be modestly higher reflecting continued growth in the natural gas drilling sector and higher metalrelated traffic volumes due to increased domestic and global steel production additionally average revenue per unit is expected to be higher

automotive revenues rose 20 compared to 2010 reflecting a 14 increase in traffic volume due to increased domestic production of north american light vehicles and a 5 improvement in average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and increased fuel surcharges

in 2010 automotive revenues rose 23 compared to 2009 a network redesign that eliminated reloadings at mixing centers resulted in fewer carloads and higher revenue per unit approximately 33200 carloads were eliminated in 2010 as a result of the design changes in the automotive network this reduction in carloadings was completely offset by higher volumes associated with the 40 increase in production of north american light vehicles

for 2012 automotive revenues are expected to modestly increase as a result of volume gains driven by an increase in domestic production of north american light vehicles at plants served by ns in addition to higher average revenue per unit related to rate increases from escalators and contract renegotiations

paper clay and forest products revenues increased 6 in 2011 compared with 2010 reflecting an 11 improvement in average revenue per unit due to increased rates and higher fuel surcharges which more than offset the effects of the 4 traffic volume decline the decline in volume was principally due to fewer shipments of wood chips as dryer weather in the southeast prompted customer sourcing changes in addition to the closure of a plant in the third quarter of 2011 reduced shipments of kaolin and newsprint associated with lower demand and the loss of some lowerrated business also impacted the year

in 2010 paper clay and forest products revenues increased 7 compared with 2009 the improvement resulted from a 7 increase in traffic volumes a reflection of increased pulp board pulp kaolin lumber and newsprint shipments as a result of improvements in the domestic and global economies 

for 2012 paper clay and forest products revenues are expected to be slightly higher as increased average revenue per unit is expected to be partially offset by reduced volumes as demand stays soft

k23 intermodal revenues increased 334 million or 19 compared with 2010 reflecting a 10 increase in traffic volume and an 8 improvement in average revenue per unit as a result of higher fuel surcharges and increased rates in 2011 all intermodal segments experienced volume increases reflecting a steadily improving economy as well as tight truck capacity domestic volume which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies’ volumes increased 15 international traffic volume improved 5 premium business which includes parcel and lessthantruckload ltl carriers increased 9 and triple crown services triple crown a service with railtohighway trailers experienced a 1 growth in volume 

in 2010 intermodal revenues increased 266 million or 17 compared with 2009 reflecting a 16 increase in traffic volume and a 1 improvement in average revenue per unit in 2010 all intermodal segments experienced volume increases reflecting a steadily improving economy as well as an increase in market demand domestic volume increased 27 international traffic volume improved 7 premium business increased 16 and triple crown experienced a 5 growth in volume 

for 2012 intermodal revenues are expected to increase due to higher traffic volume and average revenue per unit as a result of an increase in market demand and a steadily improving economy 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses in 2011 were 80 billion up 11 billion or 16 compared to 2010 expenses in 2010 were 68 billion up 833 million or 14 compared to 2009 the increase in 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to higher fuel prices and increased volumerelated expenses while 2011 also reflected a 58 million unfavorable arbitration ruling the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses improved to 712 in 2011 compared with 719 in 2010 and 754 in 2009 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

 fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations increased 510 million or 47 in 2011 and increased 354 million or 49 in 2010 the increase in 2011 was principally the result of higher fuel prices locomotive fuel prices rose 37 which had an impact of 431 million as well as increased fuel consumption locomotive fuel consumption grew 8 which had an impact of 79 million

the increase in 2010 reflected higher fuel prices locomotive fuel prices increased 33 which had an effect of 271 million as well as increased fuel consumption locomotive fuel consumption rose 12 which had an effect of 83 million

k24 compensation and benefits  which represents 37 of total operating expenses increased 266 million or 10 in 2011 the rise was principally the result of higher

agreement employee activity levels associated with increased traffic volumes up 70 million agreement health and welfare benefit costs for active employees up 50 million incentive compensation up 39 million payroll taxes up 37 million pension expenses up 19 million and wage rates up 16 million in 2010 compensation and benefits increased 307 million or 13 compared with 2009 primarily due to higher employee activity levels associated with increased traffic volumes up 88 million increased health and welfare benefit costs for active and retired employees up 67 million increased wage rates up 51 million higher incentive and stockbased compensation up 48 million increased pension expenses up 30 million and higher payroll taxes up 19 million 

ns employment averaged 30329 in 2011 compared with 28559 in 2010 and 28593 in 2009 the 2011 increase was a result of higher volume demands during the year looking forward to 2012 ns expects employment levels to be higher than 2011 accordingly ns also expects increased compensation and benefits costs as a result of anticipated volume increases and ns’ emphasis on service in addition to higher health and welfare benefit costs and wage rates

materials and other expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters increased 167 million or 22 in 2011 and increased 116 million or 18 in 2010 as shown in the following table 

 the increase in 2011 reflected the unfavorable arbitration ruling discussed below and higher costs associated with locomotive and railcar materials taxes primarily sales and use property and excise and employee travel the increase for 2011 also reflected less favorable personal injury claims development and higher supply costs

the increase in 2010 reflected increased locomotive and roadway materials expenses reduced level of favorable personal injury claims development the absence of the 21 million favorable settlement of a multiyear state tax dispute that benefited 2009 and higher costs associated with supplies employee travel derailments environmental remediation and property taxes

the consolidated balance sheets reflect longterm receivables for estimated recoveries from ns’ insurance carriers for claims associated with the january 6 2005 derailment in graniteville sc in the first quarter of 2011 ns received an unfavorable ruling for an arbitration claim with an insurance carrier and was denied recovery of the contested portion 43 million of the claim as a result ns recorded a 43 million charge during the first quarter of 2011 for the receivables associated with the contested portion of the claim and a 15 million charge for other receivables affected by the ruling for which recovery is no longer probable during the first quarter of 2010 ns settled an arbitration claim 100 million with another insurance carrier with no adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity

k25 the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 44 of total employee injury cases resolved and about 31 of total employee injury payments made with its longestablished commitment to safety ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs with respect to occupational injuries which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately the majority of these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers’ liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased system which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers’ compensation system 

ns maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims it also retains reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance see note 16 

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses increased 133 million or 9 in 2011 and increased 74 million or 5 in 2010 

purchased services costs were 13 billion in 2011 12 billion in 2010 and 11 billion in 2009 the increases in 2011 and 2010 were principally driven by higher costs associated with higher volumes

equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment amounted to 338 million 326 million and 316 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increases in 2011 and 2010 were principally due to higher traffic volumes 

depreciation expense increased 43 million or 5 in 2011 but decreased 18 million or 2 in 2010 the increase in 2011 reflects ns’ larger roadway and equipment capital base as ns continues to invest in its infrastructure

the decrease in 2010 reflected lower depreciation rates that resulted from an equipment study that was completed in the first quarter of 2010 which more than offset the effects of ns’ larger roadway and equipment capital base

other income – net 

other income – net was 160 million in 2011 153 million in 2010 and 127 million in 2009 see note 2 the increase in 2011 reflected reduced interest expense net on uncertain tax positions down 9 million higher net corporateowned life insurance returns up 7 million and increased coal royalties up 6 million the increases were offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property down 9 million and increased professional and legal fees associated with the third quarter debt exchange and the fourth quarter credit facility renewal up 7 million 

the increase in 2010 reflected higher gains on the sale of property including a 35 million gain on the sale of land to the city of virginia beach virginia and a 13 million favorable coal royalty settlement these increases were offset in part by increased interest expense net on uncertain tax positions and other tax contingencies which includes the absence of 2009 favorable resolution of prior years’ tax matters

income taxes 

income tax expense in 2011 was 1 billion for an effective rate of 34 compared with effective rates of 37 in 2010 and 36 in 2009 the decrease in the rate for 2011 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of an irs examination of ns’ 2008 return and review of certain claims for refund 40 million a decrease in deferred tax expense for state tax law changes 28 million and the absence of a first quarter 2010 charge to deferred tax expense 27 million due to a change in the tax law impacting the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program these decreases were offset in part by the absence of a fourth quarter 2010 34 million benefit resulting from a change in estimate related to ns’ deferred taxes the increase in the rate for 2010 was primarily due to the medicarerelated charge a lower benefit from conrail equity and an increase in state taxes offset in part by the 34 million deferred tax benefit mentioned above

k26 fiftypercent bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2008 through 2010 in december 2010 the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act increased bonus depreciation to 100 percent for the period september 2010 through the end of 2011 and allows 50 percent bonus depreciation in 2012 bonus depreciation does not affect ns’ total provision for income taxes or effective tax rate but does significantly lower current tax expense and the related cash outflows for income taxes paid

ns’ consolidated income tax returns for 2009 and 2010 are undergoing routine audit by the irs

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities ns’ principal source of liquidity was 32 billion in 2011 compared with 27 billion in 2010 and 19 billion in 2009 the improvement in 2011 reflects better operating results and lower income taxes paid due to additional bonus depreciation the increase in 2010 reflected improved operating results in addition to a reduction in working capital components operating cash flows in 2010 also benefited from the favorable settlement of an insurance claim related to the 2005 graniteville derailment ns had working capital of 50 million at december 31 2011 compared with working capital of 389 million at december 31 2010 reflecting a lower cash balance offset in part by lower current maturities of longterm debt as no senior notes will mature in 2012 ns’ portfolio of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances totaled 301 million and 11 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and was invested in accordance with ns’ corporate investment policy as approved by the board of directors the portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk there are no limits or restrictions on ns’ access to these assets ns expects that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations

contractual obligations at december 31 2011 comprised of ns’ longterm debt including capital leases see note 8 operating leases see note 9 agreements with crc and longterm advances from conrail see note 5 unconditional purchase obligations see note 16 and unrecognized tax benefits see note 3 were as follows 

  when the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period when the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the other column

off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9

k27 cash used in investing activities was 18 billion in 2011 and 15 billion in both 2010 and 2009 the increase in 2011 reflects higher property additions offset in part by a decrease in investment purchases in 2010 higher property additions were offset by lower net investment activity

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years

   for 2012 ns has budgeted 24 billion for property additions the anticipated spending includes 840 million for roadway assets including the normalized replacement of rail ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges planned equipment spending of 588 million includes new and rebuilt locomotives coal cars intermodal containers and chassis and multilevel automobile racks investments in facilities and terminals are anticipated to be 322 million primarily for intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network including the crescent corridor program bulk transfer facilities and mechanical service shops ns has budgeted 247 million for the continued implementation of positive train control ptc and expects additional ptcrelated property additions of at least 800 million in the years 2013 through 2015 ns also expects to spend 134 million on infrastructure improvements which include investments for the crescent and midamerica corridors create project and the pan am southern venture technology investments of 92 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers

k28 the crescent corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless highcapacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from new jersey to louisiana and offering truckcompetitive service along several major interstate highway corridors including i81 i85 i20 i40 i59 i78 and i75 based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief ns plans to implement certain elements of the crescent corridor through a series of publicprivate partnerships currently the crescent corridor has received or expects to receive a total of 267 million in public capital funding commitments from the commonwealths of pennsylvania and virginia the state of tennessee the federal tiger stimulus program and other federal funding sources related to projects in alabama pennsylvania tennessee and north carolina ns currently estimates spending up to 360 million for the substantial completion of work on these projects which is expected in 2014 planned 2012 investments for the crescent corridor approximate 128 million

cash used in financing activities was 20 billion in 2011 compared with 14 billion in 2010 and 31 million in 2009 the change in 2011 primarily reflects increased share repurchases offset in part by higher proceeds from borrowing net of debt repayments the change in 2010 reflected the resumed repurchase and retirement of common stock as part of ns’ share repurchase program in addition to lower borrowings net of debt repayments 

share repurchases totaled 21 billion in 2011 863 million in 2010 and zero in 2009 for the purchase and retirement of 302 million 147 million and zero shares respectively the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by management’s assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash cash on hand or proceeds from borrowings as of december 31 2011 ns had remaining authority from its board of directors to repurchase 154 million shares through december 31 2014

during the fourth quarter of 2011 ns issued 500 million of 325 senior notes due 2021 and an additional 100 million of 6 senior notes due 2111

during the third quarter of 2011 ns issued 600 million of unsecured notes 596 million at 4837 due 2041 and 4 million at 6 due 2111 and paid 146 million of premium in exchange for 526 million of its previously issued unsecured notes 422 million at 705 due 2037 77 million at 79 due 2097 and 27 million at 725 due 2031 the premium is reflected as a reduction of debt in the 2011 consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows and will be amortized as additional interest expense over the terms of the new debt no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the debt exchange

during the second quarter of 2011 ns issued an additional 400 million of 6 senior notes due 2111

ns’ debttototal capitalization ratio was 432 at december 31 2011 compared with 397 at december 31 2010

as of december 31 2011 ns has authority from its board of directors to issue an additional 1 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale ns has on file with the securities and exchange commission a form s3 automatic shelf registration statement for wellknown seasoned issuers under which securities may be issued pursuant to this authority

in december 2011 ns renewed and amended its fiveyear credit agreement which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants the renewed and amended fiveyear agreement which expires in 2016 reduced the total amount that can be borrowed from 1 billion to 750 million to more closely match ns’ liquidity requirements ns had no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2011 and ns is in compliance with all of its covenants in october 2011 ns renewed its 350 million accounts receivable securitization program with a 364day term to run until october 2012 there was 200 million outstanding under this program at december 31 2011 and 2010 see note 8

looking forward ns’ annual debt maturities are relatively modest see note 8 overall ns’ goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support ns’ business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles

k29 application of critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances management regularly discusses the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value management makes these estimates based on the company’s historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance management utilizes an independent actuarial consulting firm’s studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities

ns’ net pension expense which is included in “compensation and benefits” in its consolidated statements of income was 50 million for 2011 in recording this amount ns assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 875 which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 16 million change in pension expense and as a result an equal change in “compensation and benefits” expense changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns’ net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments ns utilizes analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds ns uses the results of the yield curve analyses to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans

ns’ net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was 101 million for 2011 in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits which is included in “other postretirement benefits” management estimated future increases in healthcare costs these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note 11

properties and depreciation 

most of ns’ total assets are longlived railway properties see note 6 as disclosed in note 1 ns’ properties are depreciated using group depreciation the primary depreciation method for ns’ asset base is group life units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives

ns’ depreciation expense is based on management’s assumptions concerning expected service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement in developing these assumptions ns’ management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the surface transportation board stb the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices ns’ depreciation studies are conducted about every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property the frequency of these studies correlates with guidelines established by the stb

k30 key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include

statistical analyses of historical retirement data and surviving asset records review of historical salvage received and current market rates review of ns’ operations including expected changes in technology customer demand maintenance practices and asset management strategies review of accounting policies and assumptions and industry review and analysis the units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors ns’ experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors in developing the respective depreciation rate consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age weight condition new or second hand and type curve or straight as a result a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base

ns’ recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense changes in rates as a result of depreciation studies are implemented prospectively these studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property as determined by the study ns’ depreciation expense for 2011 amounted to 862 million ns’ composite depreciation rates for 2011 are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 32 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense for 2011 roadway depreciation rates ranged from 083 to 333 and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 132 to 3784

when properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business the cost of the assets net of sale proceeds or salvage is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings actual historical cost values are retired when available such as with equipment assets the use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs when retiring rail ties and ballast ns uses statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired the historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the us bureau of labor statistics the indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets these indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in “other income – net” see note 2 since such income is not a product of ns’ railroad operations

a retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates gains or losses from abnormal retirements would be recognized in earnings however there were no such gains or losses in 2011 2010 or 2009

ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flow assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

ns’ expense for casualties and other claims included in “materials and other” amounted to 216 million in 2011 typically most of this expense relates to ns’ accrual for personal injury liabilities jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded in all cases ns records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable

k31 to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period ns utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm for employee personal injury cases the actuarial firm studies ns’ historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences an estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims is based on the results of this analysis for occupational injury claims the actuarial firm studies ns’ history of claim filings severity payments and other relevant facts additionally the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting ns’ experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which ns would recognize when such a change became known while actuarial studies reflected a reduced level of favorable claims development between 2009 and 2010 resulting in an increase of the annual cost related to personal injuries from 51 million to 75 million a continued reduced level of favorable development in 2011 resulted in an increase in the annual cost related to personal injuries to 88 million in 2011 from 75 million in 2010 while the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study it is possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower

ns is subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations it is ns’ policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 16 claims if any against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by ns are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the consolidated balance sheets and are not netted against the associated ns liability environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately 32 million in 2011 26 million in 2010 and 20 million in 2009 and property additions for environmental matters totaled approximately 7 million in 2011 8 million in 2010 and 11 million in 2009 property additions for environmental matters in 2012 are expected to be about 9 million

ns’ consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of 35 million at december 31 2011 and 33 million at december 31 2010 of which 12 million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period at december 31 2011 the liability represents ns’ estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 149 known locations and projects as of that date seven sites accounted for approximately 13 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period

at 26 locations one or more ns subsidiaries in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statutes that impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs ns calculates its estimated liability for these sites based on facts and legal defenses applicable to each site and not solely on the basis of the potential for joint liability

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns’ ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new cleanup technologies unpredictable contaminant recovery and reduction rates associated with available cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss and that participant’s ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities

k32 based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known management believes that it has recorded the probable and reasonably estimable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which ns is aware further management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity

norfolk southern andor certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to expenses while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments in management’s opinion any such recorded liability is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter any adjustments to the recorded liability will be reflected in earnings in the periods in which such adjustments are known

income taxes 

ns’ net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 75 billion at december 31 2011 see note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized ns had a 19 million valuation allowance on 957 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2011 reflecting the expectation that almost all of these assets will be realized 

in addition ns has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded for every one half percent change in the 2011 effective tax rate net income would have changed by 15 million

other matters 

labor agreements 

more than 80 of ns’ railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act rla ns largely bargains nationally in concert with other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee nccc moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and unions may propose changes

the nccc’s most recent round of bargaining began in november 2009 although the current agreements with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet and the american train dispatchers association atda extend through december 31 2014 the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements will apply to the blet and atda additionally ns bargains separately with longshoremen who are represented by the international longshoremen’s association ila at ashtabula ohio docks and do not participate in national bargaining a new national agreement was reached with the united transportation union utu on september 16 2011 setting forth terms and working conditions through december 31 2014 the utu represents conductors trainmen hostlers and yardmasters

k33 generally after a period of direct negotiations either party may file for mediation if it believes insufficient progress is being made the status quo is preserved during mediation while a federal mediator assists the parties in their efforts to reach an agreement and if unsuccessful either party may seek selfhelp strike or lockout after a 30day cooling off period following failed mediation with two coalitions representing twelve unions president obama created presidential emergency board peb no 243 in october 2011 which delayed any strike for 60 days while the peb investigated the facts of the dispute and made recommendations since november 2011 the nccc has reached tentative national mediated agreements with all twelve unions largely adopting the recommendations of the peb agreements with eleven of these unions have been ratified by their memberships the tentative agreement with the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes division bmwed must still be ratified by its membership

market risks and hedging activities

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads under the staggers rail act of 1980 includes exemptions of intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar traffic lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing transportation contracts on these shipments and on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the duration of the contract about 87 of ns’ freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts

efforts were made in 2010 to resubject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation and such efforts are expected to continue in 2011 the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially balanced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly ns will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation

competition  there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workin progress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages

ns’ primary rail competitor is the csx system both operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory ns also competes with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage of sourcing products from different geographic areas and of using substitute products

certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets

security of operations  ns has taken significant steps to provide enhanced security for the ns rail system in particular ns has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents the ns departmental security plan outlines the protocol within ns for all concerned to be notified of aar alert level changes all ns operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change

the ns plan also effectively addresses and complies with department of transportation security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and recertification programs toward that end ns working closely with the national transit institute at rutgers university has developed a fourmodule uniform national training program ns also has worked with the transportation security administration tsa in developing other industry training programs more indepth security training has been given to those select ns employees who have been given specific security responsibilities and additional locationspecific security plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and each of six port facilities served by ns with respect to the ports each facility plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and subject to inspection by the us coast guard

additionally ns engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the tsa the federal bureau of investigation fbi the federal railroad administration fra the us coast guard us customs and border protection and various state homeland security offices as one notable example an ns police special agent under the auspices of the aar has been assigned to the national joint terrorism task force njttf operating out of fbi headquarters in washington dc to represent and serve as liaison to the north american rail industry this arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole while having the post filled by an ns special agent has served to foster a strong working relationship between ns and the fbi ns also has become a member of the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat program sponsored by us customs ctpat allows ns to work closely with us customs and its customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on ns particularly those moving to or from a foreign country based on participation in ctpat ns has ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by us customs

similarly ns is guided in its operations by various supplemental security action items issued by dhs and us department of transportation dot us coast guard maritime security requirements as well as voluntary security action items developed in 2006 in collaboration with tsa dot and the freight railroads many of the action items are based on lessons learned from dhs and dot security assessments of rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua begun in 2004 particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify through risk assessments those locations where security risks are the highest these action items and ns’ compliance initiatives are outlined in the various departmental sections of the ns departmental security plan ns has taken appropriate actions to be compliant with the 2008 tsa final security rule addressing rail security sensitive materials rssm to ensure these shipments are properly inspected and that positive chainofcustody is maintained when required ns has met the september 2009 deadline to be in compliance with the 2008 pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa railrouting regulations outlined in docket hm232e in 2010 this methodology and selected routes were reviewed by phmsa and found to be compliant with the regulation

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

overview 

ns’ results in 2010 reflect a substantial increase in revenues due to increased traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit driven by the growth of domestic and global economies revenues increased 15 billion or 19 in 2010 as higher demand for rail freight transportation led to additional volumes carloadings were up 806800 units or 14 reflecting growth in all commodity groups operating expenses increased 833 million reflecting increased traffic volumes as well as higher fuel prices despite the 14 increase in expenses the operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses improved to 719 and income from railway operations rose 36 

cash provided by operating activities was 27 billion which allowed for capital expenditures and share repurchases during 2010 147 million shares of norfolk southern corporation common stock common stock were repurchased at a total cost of 863 million since inception of the stock repurchase program in 2006 ns has repurchased and retired 794 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 41 billion at december 31 2010 cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 11 billion

looking forward to 2011 ns expects revenues to increase reflecting higher traffic volumes but at a more modest pace than seen in 2010 and improved average revenue per unit ns plans to continue to focus on safety improve service levels and maintain a marketbased approach to pricing 

summarized results of operations 

2010 compared with 2009 

net income in 2010 was 15 billion or 400 per diluted share up 462 million or 45 compared with 10 billion or 276 per diluted share in 2009 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes see note 3 railway operating revenues increased 15 billion reflecting higher traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges railway operating expenses increased 833 million principally due to higher volumerelated expenses and fuel prices 

oil prices affect ns’ results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period in addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume oil prices directly affect ns’ revenues through marketbased fuel surcharges and contract escalators see “railway operating revenues” and also affect fuel costs see “railway operating expenses” for 2010 excluding the impact of increased consumption the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was greater than the increase in fuel expense future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter 

 

k20 

2009 compared with 2008 

net income in 2009 was 10 billion or 276 per diluted share down 682 million or 40 compared with 17 billion or 452 per diluted share in 2008 the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower income from railway operations that was offset in part by lower income taxes see note 3 railway operating revenues decreased 27 billion reflecting lower traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit primarily a result of decreased fuel surcharges railway operating expenses decreased 16 billion primarily due to lower volumerelated expenses and fuel prices 

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

railway operating revenues were 95 billion in 2010 80 billion in 2009 and 107 billion in 2008 the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volumes and average revenue per unit by market group 

 revenues increased 15 billion in 2010 but decreased 27 billion in 2009 as reflected in the table on the following page the increase in 2010 was due to increased traffic volumes and higher average revenue per unit which was driven by higher fuel surcharges and rate increases offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic the decrease in 2009 was due to decreased traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit as a result of lower fuel surcharges that more than offset rate increases fuel surcharge revenue amounted to 724 million in 2010 compared with 370 million in 2009 and 16 billion in 2008 if fuel prices remain at or near yearend 2010 levels fuel surcharge revenues will increase in 2011 

many of ns’ negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise traffic are based on the monthly average price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti average price these surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the wti average price for the second preceding calendar month this twomonth lag in applying wti average price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 28 million in 2010 and 50 million in 2009 but increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 100 million in 2008 

 

k21 

 for 2010 the favorable volume variance accounted for 70 of the total increase reflecting traffic volume improvements in all commodity groups volumes increased by 806800 units or 14 reflecting the strengthening of the economy the favorable revenue per unit variance reflected increased fuel surcharges and higher rates offset in part by the effects of changes in the mix of traffic 

in 2009 the unfavorable volume variance accounted for 75 of the total decrease reflecting traffic volume declines for all commodity groups volumes declined by 14 million units or 19 reflecting the weakened economy the unfavorable revenue per unit variance was driven by decreased fuel surcharges offset in part by higher rates 

two of ns’ customers dupont and south mississippi electric power association smepa have filed rate reasonableness complaints at the surface transportation board stb alleging that the ns tariff rates for transportation of regulated movements are unreasonable ns is disputing these allegations since june 1 2009 in the case of dupont and since january 1 2011 in the case of smepa ns has been billing and collecting amounts from the customers based on the challenged tariff rates management presently expects resolution of these cases to occur in late 2012 or 2013 although the cases have not progressed to a point where management can evaluate the likelihood of the outcome unfavorable rulings could have a materially adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity

coal revenues increased 455 million or 20 compared with 2009 reflecting higher average revenue per unit and a 10 increase in traffic principally due to a rise in domestic and global steel production coal average revenue per unit was up 9 compared with 2009 reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and improved pricing

for 2011 coal revenues are expected to increase due to higher volumes and increased average revenue per unit driven by pricing improvement higher fuel surcharges and contract escalators 

coal represented 28 of ns’ revenues in 2010 and 80 of shipments handled originated on ns’ lines as shown in the following table tonnage increased in all coal markets 

 

 in 2009 coal revenues decreased 847 million or 27 compared with 2008 reflecting a 20 decrease in traffic volume due to lower coal consumption in the utility and global raw steel sectors and lower average revenue per unit coal average revenue per unit was down 9 compared with 2008 reflecting decreased fuel surcharges and declining rate adjustment factors that more than offset rate increases 

 

k22 

utility coal tonnage improved slightly as residential demand increased due to severe winter weather and above average summer temperatures on the east coast additionally electricity demand in the industrial sector was higher these increases more than offset the effects of low natural gas prices and the divergence of utility coal to the export market 

in 2009 utility coal tonnage decreased 17 compared with 2008 a result of lower demand for electricity induced by the downturn in the us economy natural gas competition and utility coal stockpiles that were above target levels across ns’ service area 

for 2011 utility coal tonnage is anticipated to increase as new mines come on line and a previously idled plant resumes operations however utility coal will have to compete with continued low natural gas prices 

export coal tonnage increased 27 compared to 2009 reflecting increased global demand for coal used in steel production tonnage handled through norfolk was up about 13 million tons or 9 and baltimore tonnage handled increased about 35 million tons or 97 

in 2009 export coal tonnage decreased 22 compared to 2008 reflecting the global recession reduced demand for steel production and high inventory levels norfolk tonnage handled decreased about 31 million tons or 18 and baltimore tonnage was down about 21 million tons or 37 

for 2011 export coal tonnage is expected to increase in response to the impact of australian flooding on global coal supply and the expected continuation of strong global demand for steel 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage increased 67 compared with 2009 as domestic steel production improved due to an increase in steel demand as blast furnaces resumed operations 

in 2009 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage decreased 35 compared with 2008 reflecting reduced demand for raw steel caused by the downturn in the us economy which led to blast furnace outages reduced coke production schedules and high inventory levels 

for 2011 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage is expected to be flat compared to 2010 

other coal tonnage principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants increased 1 compared to 2009 primarily due to new business and increased demand in the steel market

in 2009 other coal tonnage decreased 12 compared to 2008 primarily due to reduced production at nsserved plants caused by the downturn in the us economy 

for 2011 other coal tonnage is expected to be flat compared to 2010 

general merchandise revenues in 2010 increased 826 million or 20 compared with 2009 reflecting a 14 increase in traffic volume and a 5 improvement in average revenue per unit reflecting increased fuel surcharge revenue and higher rates 

 

k23 

in 2009 general merchandise revenues decreased 13 billion or 24 compared with 2008 reflecting a 21 decline in traffic volume and a 3 decrease in average revenue per unit as higher rates were overshadowed by decreased fuel surcharge revenues 

agriculture consumer products and government revenues increased 12 compared with 2009 due to an 11 increase in traffic volume and a 1 increase in average revenue per unit the increase in traffic volume was a result of more shipments of sweeteners and corn due to continued strength in the demand for ethanol higher fertilizer volumes due to farmers replenishing nutrients to meet increased crop demand and increased feed volumes due to a strong export market 

in 2009 agriculture consumer products and government revenues decreased 8 compared with 2008 the revenue decline resulted from an 8 decrease in traffic volumes as plant closures and production curtailments led to fewer shipments of fertilizer and corn 

for 2011 agriculture revenues are expected to improve as a result of increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit reflecting expected growth in sweeteners and corn driven by gains in the ethanol market 

chemicals revenue in 2010 increased 23 compared with 2009 due to an 18 increase in traffic volume and a 5 growth in average revenue per unit reflecting higher rates and increased fuel surcharges volume gains reflected new business of fly ash in addition to higher shipments of petroleum industrial intermediates plastics and miscellaneous chemicals resulting from improvements in the economy

in 2009 chemicals revenues decreased 15 compared with 2008 due to a 12 decrease in traffic volume and a 3 decline in average revenue per unit primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges the decline in traffic volume was a result of continued weakness in housing construction which drove declines in industrial intermediates plastics and miscellaneous chemicals volumes associated with pretroleumbased products also declined as a result of reduced demand for asphalt and production curtailments 

for 2011 chemicals revenues are anticipated to increase as higher average revenue per unit coupled with increased shipments of petroleum products plastics and industrial intermediates which partially offset lower volumes of fly ash 

metals and construction revenues increased 36 in 2010 reflecting a 25 increase in traffic volume and a 9 increase in average revenue per unit driven by pricing gains and increased fuel surcharges the increase in traffic volume was principally due to more shipments of coil iron and steel and scrap metal due to increased steel and automotive production as well as higher shipments of fractionating sand for natural gas drilling

in 2009 metals and construction revenues decreased 40 reflecting a 32 decrease in traffic volume and a 12 decline in average revenue per unit primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges the decline in traffic volume was principally due to lower coil scrap metal iron and steel shipments in addition to reduced demand for construction materials as a result of continued weakness in the housing infrastructure and automotive sectors 

for 2011 metals and construction revenues are expected to increase as a result of higher metalrelated traffic volumes due to increased domestic and global steel production in addition to growth in the natural gas drilling sector additionally average revenue per unit is expected to be higher 

paper clay and forest products revenues increased 7 in 2010 compared with 2009 the improvement resulted from a 7 increase in traffic volumes reflecting increased pulp board pulp kaolin lumber and newsprint shipments as a result of improvements in the domestic and global economics

in 2009 paper clay and forest products revenues decreased 26 compared with 2008 due to a 22 decrease in traffic volumes and a 5 decline in average revenue per unit primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges the volume decline reflected lower pulp board lumber kaolin printing paper and wood chip shipments due to reduced us paper production and the slowdown in the housing market 

for 2011 paper clay and forest products revenues are expected to be modestly higher as increased average revenue per unit is expected to be offset in part by reduced shipments of woodchips pulp board kaolin pulp and newsprint due to customer sourcing changes and the continued weak demand for paper

k24 

automotive revenues rose 23 compared to 2009 a network redesign that eliminated reloadings at mixing centers resulted in fewer carloads and higher revenue per unit approximately 33200 carloads were eliminated in 2010 as a result of the design changes in the automotive network this reduction in carloadings was completely offset by higher volumes associated with the 40 increased production of north american light vehicles

in 2009 automotive revenues decreased 36 compared to 2008 reflecting lower traffic volumes and decreased average revenue per unit as fuel surcharges were lower volumes decreased 30 primarily as a result of a 32 decrease in north american light vehicle production as manufacturers cut production in line with consumer demand 

for 2011 automotive revenues are expected to increase driven by volume gains due to a projected increase in north american light vehicle production in addition to higher average revenue per unit related to rate increases from escalators and contract renegotiation 

intermodal revenues increased 266 million or 17 compared with 2009 reflecting a 16 increase in traffic volume and a 1 improvement in average revenue per unit in 2010 all intermodal segments experienced volume increases reflecting a steadily improving economy as well as an increase in market demand domestic volume which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies’ volumes increased 27 international traffic volume improved 7 premium business which includes parcel and lessthantruckload ltl carriers increased 16 and triple crown services triple crown a service with railtohighway trailers experienced a 5 growth in volume 

in 2009 intermodal revenues decreased 528 million or 26 compared with 2008 reflecting a 16 reduction in traffic volume and an 11 decrease in average revenue per unit in 2009 all intermodal segments experienced depressed volumes reflecting the weak economy and lower consumer demand international traffic volume declined 30 premium business decreased 14 triple crown experienced a 10 drop in volume and domestic volume decreased less than 1 

for 2011 intermodal revenues are expected to increase due to higher average revenue per unit and volumes as a result of steadily improving economy and an increase in market demand 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses in 2010 were 68 billion up 833 million or 14 compared to 2009 expenses in 2009 were 6 billion down 16 billion or 21 compared to 2008 the increase in 2010 was primarily due to increased volumerelated expenses and higher fuel prices the decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower volumerelated expenses and lower fuel prices the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses improved to 719 in 2010 compared with 754 in 2009 and 711 in 2008 

 

k25

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

 

 compensation and benefits  which represents 40 of total operating expenses increased 307 million or 13 compared with 2009 the rise was principally the result of higher

employee activity levels associated with increased traffic volumes up 88 million health and welfare benefit costs for active and retired employees up 67 million wage rates up 51 million incentive and stockbased compensation up 48 million pension expenses up 30 million and payroll taxes up 19 million in 2009 compensation and benefits decreased 283 million or 11 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower volumerelated payroll down 217 million reduced incentive and stockbased compensation down 117 million the absence of the cost of lumpsum payments due under the 2008 brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet agreement 31 million and lower payroll taxes down 26 million these decreases were partially offset by increased wage rates up 53 million increased pension costs up 42 million and higher medical benefits up 25 million 

ns employment averaged 28559 in 2010 compared with 28593 in 2009 and 30709 in 2008 looking forward to 2011 ns expects employment levels to be more inline with 2008 employment levels and accordingly increased compensation and benefits expenses as a result of anticipated volume increases and expected higher health and welfare benefit rates 30 million for agreement employees

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses increased 74 million or 5 in 2010 compared to 2009 but decreased 196 million or 12 in 2009 compared to 2008 

purchased services costs were 12 billion in 2010 11 billion in 2009 and 12 billion in 2008 the increase in 2010 was driven by higher costs associated with volumerelated services the decrease in 2009 reflected lower volumerelated expenses such as transportation operating costs including automotiverelated costs and crew transportation expenses intermodal operations costs and mechanical and engineering expenses largely because of reduced maintenance activities these declines were offset in part by increased professional and legal services 

equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment amounted to 326 million 316 million and 357 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the increase in 2010 was principally due to higher traffic volumes whereas the decrease in 2009 was principally due to lower traffic volumes 

 

k26

fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations increased 354 million or 49 in 2010 compared with 2009 but decreased 913 million or 56 in 2009 compared with 2008 the increase in 2010 was principally the result of higher fuel prices locomotive fuel prices increased 33 which had an effect of 271 million as well as increased fuel consumption locomotive fuel consumption rose 12 which had an effect of 83 million the decline in 2009 reflected lower fuel prices which had an impact of 600 million and reduced fuel consumption which had an impact of 313 million in 2009 locomotive fuel prices declined 47 and locomotive fuel consumption fell 19 in 2009

depreciation expense decreased 18 million or 2 in 2010 compared to 2009 but increased 33 million or 4 in 2009 compared to 2008 the decrease in 2010 reflects lower depreciation rates resulting from the equipment study that was completed in the first quarter of 2010 which more than offset the effects of ns’ increased roadway and equipment capital base

the increase in 2009 was a reflection of substantial capital investments and improvements

materials and other expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters increased 116 million or 18 in 2010 compared with 2009 but decreased 211 million or 25 in 2009 compared with 2008 as shown in the following table 

 

 the increase in 2010 reflected increased locomotive and roadway materials expenses reduced favorable personal injury claims development the absence of the 21 million favorable settlement of a multiyear tax dispute that benefited 2009 and higher costs associated with supplies employee travel derailments environmental remediation and property taxes

the decrease in 2009 reflected lower locomotive freight car and roadway materials expenses lower loss and damage claims favorable personal injury claims development reduced employee travel costs a 21 million favorable adjustment related to settlement of a multiyear state tax dispute and the absence of the 2008 avondale mills settlement see additional discussion below

in 2011 ns expects materials expenses for locomotive and railcar equipment to increase by approximately 55 million due to higher traffic volumes

in april 2008 ns settled the lawsuit brought by avondale mills for claims associated with the january 6 2005 derailment in graniteville sc a portion of the settlement was not reimbursed by insurance and was included in 2008 expenses the total liability related to the derailment represents ns’ best estimate based on current facts and circumstances the estimate includes amounts related to property damage personal injury and response costs ns’ commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment above the unreimbursed portion and ns’ selfinsured retention including ns’ response costs and legal fees the consolidated balance sheets reflect longterm receivables for estimated recoveries from ns’ insurance carriers ns engaged in arbitration with two of its insurance carriers that failed to respond to insurance claims submitted by ns during the first quarter of 2010 ns settled the arbitration claim 100 million with one of the insurance carriers with no adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity the remaining insurance claim was arbitrated in december 2010 ns is currently awaiting a ruling from the arbitration panel ns believes that the arbitration panel will rule in favor of ns and recovery of the recorded receivables for the contested portion 43 million is probable 

the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 44 of total employee injury cases resolved and about 31 of total employee injury payments made with its longestablished commitment to safety ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs with respect to occupational injuries which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately the majority of these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers’ liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased system which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers’ compensation system 

 

k27 

ns maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims it also retains reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance see note 17 ns expects insurance costs to be slightly lower in 2011 

other income – net 

other income – net was 153 million in 2010 127 million in 2009 and 110 million in 2008 see note 2 the increase in 2010 reflected higher gains on the sale of property including a 35 million gain on the sale of land to the city of virginia beach virginia and a 13 million favorable coal royalty settlement these increases were offset in part by increased interest expense net on uncertain tax positions and other tax contingencies which includes the absence of 2009 favorable resolution of prior years’ tax matters

the increase in 2009 reflected higher net returns from corporateowned life insurance up 32 million offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property down 11 million 

income taxes 

income tax expense in 2010 was 871 million for an effective rate of 37 compared with effective rates of 36 in 2009 and 38 in 2008 the increase in the rate for 2010 was primarily due to a 27 million charge to deferred tax expense due to a change in the tax law impacting the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program a lower benefit from conrail equity and an increase in state taxes offset in part by a 34 million benefit resulting from a change in estimate related to ns’ deferred taxes the decrease in the rate for 2009 was primarily due to improved net returns from corporateowned life insurance and the favorable resolution of state tax issues 

fiftypercent bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2008 through 2010 in december 2010 the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act increased bonus depreciation to 100 percent for the period september 2010 through the end of 2011 and allows 50 percent bonus depreciation in 2012 bonus depreciation does not have a material effect on ns’ total provision for income taxes or effective tax rate but does significantly lower current tax expense and the related cash outflows for income taxes paid

ns’ consolidated federal income tax return for 2008 is being audited by the irs

 

k28

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities ns’ principal source of liquidity was 27 billion in 2010 compared with 19 billion in 2009 and 27 billion in 2008 the increase in 2010 reflects the improvement in operating results in addition to a reduction in working capital components operating cash flows in 2010 also benefited from the favorable settlement of an insurance claim related to the 2005 graniteville derailment the decline in 2009 reflected the 11 billion decrease in income from railway operations offset in part by lower income tax payments ns had working capital of 389 million at december 31 2010 compared with working capital of 457 million at december 31 2009 ns’ portfolio of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances totaled 11 billion at both december 31 2010 and 2009 and was invested in accordance with ns’ corporate investment policy as approved by the board of directors the portfolio contains securities that are subject to market risk there are no limits or restrictions on ns’ access to these assets ns expects that cash on hand combined with cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations

contractual obligations at december 31 2010 comprised of ns’ longterm debt including capital leases see note 8 operating leases see note 9 agreements with crc and longterm advances from conrail see note 5 unconditional purchase obligations see note 17 and unrecognized tax benefits see note 3 were as follows 

  when the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period when the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the other column

off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9

cash used in investing activities was 15 billion in both 2010 and 2009 and 12 billion in 2008 in 2010 additional capital expenditures were offset by lower net investment activity the increase in 2009 primarily reflected lower proceeds from investment sales and higher investment purchases offset in part by lower property additions

 

k29

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years

 

  

  

 for 2011 ns has budgeted 22 billion for capital expenditures the anticipated spending includes 763 million for roadway projects including the normalized replacement of rail ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges planned equipment spending of 701 million includes the acquisition of new locomotives coal cars grain covered hopper cars and intermodal containers and chassis equipment spending also includes continued improvements to the locomotive fleet including the rebuild and upgrade of existing units investments in facilities and terminals is anticipated to be 244 million primarily for intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network including the crescent corridor program of projects and bulk transfer facilities and mechanical service shops technology investments of 96 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers ns also expects to spend 79 million on infrastructure investments including the midamerica and crescent corridors ns has budgeted 146 million for 2011 for the continued implementation of positive train control and expects additional capital expenditures of at least 1 billion in the years 2012 through 2015 this includes upgrades to systems and track structure required for the federal railroad administration approved implementation of positive train control that will be accelerated from future years’ spending to meet the 2015 legislative deadline all capital expenditures are expected to be made with internally generated funds or proceeds from borrowings

the create project is a publicprivate partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan chicago area ns and other railroads have agreed to participate in create a portion of public funding has been approved the create partners have developed a list of projects to be included in phase i of create a total of 91 million in federal funding has been secured for phase i the railroads have contributed an additional 116 million and expect to complete phase i by the end of 2012 in addition 133 million from the high speed rail program and 100 million from the tiger stimulus program have been committed to specific create projects the state of illinois and city of chicago have also committed 14 million in additional funding as currently planned the total create project is estimated to cost 32 billion with city state and federal support if additional public funding is secured the railroads are expected to contribute a total of 171 million towards the entire project ns expects to spend approximately 10 million in 2011 related to the create projects

the meridian speedway is a 320mile rail line between meridian mississippi and shreveport louisiana on may 1 2006 ns and kansas city southern kcs formed a joint venture meridian speedway llc msllc pursuant to which ns agreed to contribute 300 million in cash substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements in exchange for a 30 interest in the joint venture to date ns has contributed 283 million at the formation of msllc kcs contributed the meridian speedway the joint venture increases capacity and is designed to improve service over the meridian speedway into the southeast

pan am southern llc pas is a railroad company joint venture in which ns and pan am railways inc pan am each has a 50 equity interest as of december 31 2010 ns has contributed cash and other property with a combined value of approximately 116 million and committed to contribute an additional 24 million in cash over the next two years a significant portion of ns’ contributions has and will continue to be used for capital improvements to the pas lines and the related construction of new intermodal and automotive terminals

the crescent corridor consists of a program of projects for infrastructure and other facility improvements geared toward creating a seamless highcapacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from new jersey to louisiana and offering truckcompetitive service along several major interstate highway corridors including i81 i85 i20 i40 i59 i78 and i75 based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief ns plans to implement certain elements of the crescent corridor program of projects through a series of publicprivate partnerships currently the crescent corridor has received or expects to receive a total of 210 million in public capital funding commitments from the commonwealths of pennsylvania and virginia the states of alabama and tennessee the federal tiger stimulus program and other federal funding sources related to projects in alabama pennsylvania tennessee and north carolina ns currently estimates spending up to 207 million for the substantial completion of work on these projects which is expected in 2012 including planned 2011 capital expenditures as high as 70 million

the midamerica corridor is a proposed cooperative arrangement between ns and canadian national railway cn to effectively share track between chicago st louis kentucky and mississippi in order to establish more efficient routes for traffic moving between the midwestern and southeastern us including potential coal traffic moving to nsserved southeastern utility plants from cnserved illinois basin coal producers to implement the midamerica corridor ns will continue to expend funds to upgrade the rail line operated by west tennessee railway between fulton kentucky and corinth mississippi a line over which ns would operate pursuant to recently obtained trackage rights in addition ns will construct a connection with cn east of st louis implementation of the midamerica corridor arrangement will begin in 2011 with the start of a daily train between st louis and the southeast projected capital improvements for 2011 are expected to be approximately 17 million

 

k31

cash used in financing activities was 14 billion 2010 compared with 31 million in 2009 and 11 billion in 2008 the change in 2010 reflected the resumed repurchase and retirement of common stock as part of ns’ share repurchase program in addition to lower borrowings net of debt repayments the change in 2009 reflected the absence of share repurchase activity and higher borrowings net of debt repayments that were offset in part by fewer exercises of employee stock options and increased dividends 

share repurchases totaled 863 million in 2010 zero in 2009 and 11 billion in 2008 for the purchase and retirement of 147 million zero and 194 million shares respectively on july 27 2010 ns’ board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of common stock through december 31 2014 the timing and volume of future share repurchases will be guided by management’s assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors any nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash or proceeds from borrowings

during the third quarter 2010 ns issued 250 million of unsecured notes at 600 due 2105

as of december 31 2010 ns has authority from its board of directors to issue an additional 1 billion of debt or equity securities through public or private sale ns has on file with the securities and exchange commission a form s3 automatic shelf registration statement for wellknown seasoned issuers under which securities may be issued pursuant to this authority

ns also has in place and available a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement expiring in 2012 which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants ns had no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2010 and ns is in compliance with all of its covenants in october 2010 ns renewed its 350 million accounts receivable securitization program with a 364day term to run until october 2011 there was 200 million outstanding under this program at december 31 2010 see note 8

looking forward ns’ annual debt maturities are relatively modest see note 8 overall ns’ goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support ns’ business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles

application of critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances management regularly discusses the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors

 

k32

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value management makes these estimates based on the company’s historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance management utilizes an independent consulting actuarial firm’s studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities

ns’ net pension expense which is included in “compensation and benefits” in its consolidated statements of income was 31 million for the year ended december 31 2010 in recording this amount ns assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 875 which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 16 million change in pension expense and as a result an equal change in “compensation and benefits” expense changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns’ net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments ns utilizes analyses in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans are matched with yield curves based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds ns uses the results of the yield curves to select the discount rates that match the payment streams of the benefits in these plans

ns’ net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was 114 million for the year ended december 31 2010 in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits which is included in “other postretirement benefits” management estimated future increases in healthcare costs these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note 11

properties and depreciation 

most of ns’ total assets are longlived railway properties see note 6 as disclosed in note 1 ns’ properties are depreciated using group depreciation the primary depreciation method for ns’ asset base is group life units of production is the principal method of depreciation for rail in high density corridors and for depletion of natural resources remaining properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives

ns’ depreciation expense is based on management’s assumptions concerning expected service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement in developing these assumptions ns’ management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an independent outside firm of consulting engineers and approved by the surface transportation board “stb” the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over railroad practices ns’ depreciation studies are conducted every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets and other roadway property the frequency of these studies correlates with guidelines established by the stb key factors which are considered in developing average service life and salvage estimates include

statistical analysis of historical retirement data and surviving asset records review of historical salvage received and current market rates review of ns’ operations including expected changes in technology customer demand maintenance practices and asset management strategies review of accounting policies and assumptions and industry review and analysis the units of production depreciation rate for rail in high density corridors is derived based on consideration of annual gross ton miles as compared to the total or ultimate capacity of rail in these corridors ns’ experience has shown that traffic density is a leading factor in determination of the expected service life of rail in high density corridors in developing the respective depreciation rate consideration is also given to several rail characteristics including age weight condition new or second hand and type curve or tangent as a result a composite depreciation rate is developed which is applied to the depreciable base

ns’ recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense changes in rates as a result of depreciation studies are implemented prospectively these studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property as determined by the study ns’ depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2010 amounted to 819 million ns’ composite depreciation rates for 2010 are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 30 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense for 2010 roadway depreciation rates ranged from 083 to 333 and equipment depreciation rates ranged from 132 to 3784

k33

when properties other than land and nonrail assets are sold or retired in the ordinary course of business the cost of the assets net of sale proceeds or salvage is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized in earnings actual historical cost values are retired when available such as with equipment assets the use of estimates in recording the retirement of certain roadway assets is necessary based on the impracticality of tracking individual asset costs when retiring rail ties and ballast ns uses statistical curves that indicate the relative distribution of the age of the assets retired the historical cost of other roadway assets is estimated using a combination of inflation indices specific to the rail industry and those published by the us bureau of labor statistics the indices are applied to the replacement value based on the age of the retired assets these indices are used because they closely correlate with the costs of roadway assets gains and losses on disposal of land and nonrail assets are included in “other income – net” see note 2 since such income is not a product of ns’ railroad operations

a retirement is considered abnormal if it does not occur in the normal course of business if it relates to disposition of a large segment of an asset class and if the retirement varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies which inherently consider the impact of normal retirements on expected service lives and depreciation rates gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recognized in earnings there were no gains or losses recognized in 2010 2009 or 2008 due to abnormal retirement of depreciable railroad property

ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flow assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

ns’ expense for casualties and other claims included in “materials and other” amounted to 142 million for the year ended december 31 2010 most of this expense was ns’ accrual related to personal injury liabilities jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded in all cases ns records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable

to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period ns’ management utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm for employee personal injury cases the actuarial firm studies ns’ historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences an estimate of the the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims is based on the results of this analysis for occupational injury claims the actuarial firm studies ns’ history of claim filings severity payments and other relevant facts additionally the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting ns’ experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which ns would recognize when such a change became known while actuarial studies reflected favorable claims development between 2008 and 2009 resulting in a decrease of the annual cost related to personal injuries from 78 million to 51 million a reduced level of favorable development in 2010 resulted in an increase in the annual cost related to personal injuries to 75 million in 2010 from 51 million in 2009 while the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study it is possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower

ns is subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations it is ns’ policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 17 claims if any against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by ns are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the consolidated balance sheets and are not netted against the associated ns liability environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately 26 million in 2010 20 million in 2009 and 18 million in 2008 and capital expenditures for environmental matters totaled approximately 8 million in 2010 11 million in 2009 and 7 million in 2008 capital expenditures for environmental matters in 2011 are expected to be about 9 million

ns’ consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of 33 million at december 31 2010 and 32 million at december 31 2009 of which 12 million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period at december 31 2010 the liability represents ns’ estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 143 known locations as of that date 11 sites accounted for 15 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period

at 32 locations one or more ns subsidiaries usually in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statues which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs

 

k34

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns’ ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss and that participant’s ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities

based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which ns is aware further management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity

norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to expenses while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments in management’s opinion the recorded liability if any is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known

income taxes 

ns’ net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 71 billion at december 31 2010 see note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized ns had a 21 million valuation allowance on 823 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2010 reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized during 2010 ns performed a review and reevaluation of its estimates for deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting in a reduction of income tax expense of 34 million

in addition ns has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded for every one half percent change in the 2010 effective tax rate net income would have changed by 12 million

 

k35

other matters 

labor agreements 

more than 80 of ns’ railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act rla ns largely bargains nationally in concert with other major railroads moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose changes

on or after november 1 2009 ns and the nation’s other major railroads represented by the national carriers conference committee nccc served new proposals to begin the current round of bargaining the nccc and a coalition of six unions led by the transportation communications union tcu are currently negotiating with the assistance of a mediator from the national mediation board on january 12 2011 the national mediation board accepted the application for mediation filed on behalf of the rail labor bargaining coalition representing six labor organizations in national bargaining and a mediator has been assigned the outcome of any of the negotiations cannot be determined at this point

the current agreements with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet and the american train dispatchers association atda extend through 2014 because ns has reached separate agreements with the blet and the atda only the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements apply to ns’ locomotive engineers and atdarepresented dispatchers ns bargains separately with longshoremen who are represented by the international longshoremen’s association ila at ashtabula ohio docks and do not participate in national bargaining

market risks and hedging activities 

ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments and by entering into interestrate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio

at december 31 2010 ns’ debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 200 million a 1 point increase in interest rates would increase ns’ total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately 2 million management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity

at december 31 2010 ns did not have fixed rate capital leases that were converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements at december 31 2009 some of ns’ capital leases which carried an average fixed rate of 7 were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements on december 31 2009 the average pay rate under these agreements was 1 and the average receive rate was 6 during 2010 and 2009 the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by less than 1 million in both periods a portion of the lease obligation was payable in japanese yen ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yendenominated obligation most of these deposits are held by foreign banks primarily japanese as a result ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy

inflation 

in preparing financial statements us generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property ns a capitalintensive company has most of its capital invested in such property the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost

government regulation  in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses ns railroads are subject to regulation by the stb the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers the federal railroad administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards 

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads under the staggers rail act of 1980 includes exemptions of intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar traffic lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing transportation contracts on these shipments and on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the duration of the contract about 88 of ns freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts 

efforts were made in 2009 to resubject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation and such efforts are expected to continue in 2010 the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially balanced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly ns will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

competition  there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprogress users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

ns primary rail competitor is the csx system both operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory ns also competes with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage of sourcing products from different geographic areas and of using substitute products 

certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations  ns has taken significant steps to provide enhanced security for the ns rail system in particular ns has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents the ns departmental security plan outlines the protocol within ns for all concerned to be notified of aar alert level changes all ns operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

the ns plan also effectively addresses and complies with department of transportation security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and recertification programs toward that end ns working closely with the national transit institute at rutgers university has developed a fourmodule uniform national training program ns also has worked with the transportation security administration tsa in developing other industry training programs more indepth security training has been given to those select ns employees who have been given specific security responsibilities and additional locationspecific security plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and each of six port facilities served by ns with respect to the ports each facility plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

additionally ns engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the tsa the federal bureau of investigation fbi the federal railroad administration fra the us coast guard us customs and border protection and various state homeland security offices as one notable example an ns police special agent under the auspices of the aar has been assigned to the national joint terrorism task force njttf operating out of fbi headquarters in washington dc to represent and serve as liaison to the north american rail industry this arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole while having the post filled by an ns special agent has served to foster a strong working relationship between ns and the fbi ns also has become a member of the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat program sponsored by us customs ctpat allows ns to work closely with us customs and its customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on ns particularly those moving to or from a foreign country based on participation in ctpat ns has ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by us customs 

similarly ns is guided in its operations by various supplemental security action items issued by dhs and us department of transportation dot us coast guard maritime security requirements as well as voluntary security action items developed in 2006 in collaboration with tsa dot and the freight railroads many of the action items are based on lessons learned from dhs and dot security assessments of rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua begun in 2004 particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in htua by 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify through risk assessments those locations where security risks are the highest these action items and ns compliance initiatives are outlined in the various departmental sections of the ns departmental security plan ns has taken appropriate actions to be compliant with the 2008 tsa final security rule addressing rail security sensitive materials rssm to ensure these shipments are properly inspected and that positive chainofcustody is maintained when required ns has met the september 2009 deadline to be in compliance with the 2008 pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa railrouting regulations outlined in docket hm232e 

in 2009 through participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response transcaer program ns provided rail accident response training to approximately 4500 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel representing over 34000 manhours of emergency response training ns also conducted railroad operations classes for fbi agents and the railroad liaison agents from joint terrorism task forces ns other training efforts throughout 2009 included participation in 10 drills for local state and federal agencies ns also has ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at the security and emergency response training course sertc conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado also the ns annual transcaer whistlestop train makes stops in numerous cities its special training cars serving as a resource to an audience of nearly 1000 emergency responders annually 

improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa in coordination with the fra is amending the hazardous materials regulations to prescribe enhanced safety measures for rail transportation of tih materials including interim design standards for railroad tank cars the rule mandates commodityspecific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured dot specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard the interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of tih tank cars 




 item 1a risk factors 

ns is subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial operating and environmental matters railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has jurisdiction over some routes rates and fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or existing laws could have a significant negative impact on ns ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on ns rail network or abandonment of lines

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

overview 

while ns results in 2009 reflect the decline of the domestic and global economies they also demonstrate ns ability to focus on safety service asset management and sustainabilityall while controlling costs revenues decreased 27 billion or 25 in 2009 as manufacturers reduced production to meet sagging consumer demand and the decline in oil prices resulted in lower fuel surcharge revenues carloadings were down 14 million units or 19 reflecting declines across all commodity groups ns partially offset this 25 decline in revenues with a 16 billion or 21 decrease in operating expenses notwithstanding these cost reductions income from railway operations fell 36 and the operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses rose to 754 

despite the decline in ns net income for 2009 cash provided by operating activities was 19 billion which exceeded cash used for capital expenditures and dividends net proceeds from borrowings minus debt repayments was 403 million resulting in an increase in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments which at december 31 2009 totaled 11 billion 

looking forward to 2010 ns expects revenues to increase reflecting improved average revenue per unit and higher traffic volume due to a gradual yet steady economic recovery ns plans to continue to improve service and maintain a marketbased approach to pricing 

summarized results of operations 

2009 compared with 2008 

net income in 2009 was 10 billion or 276 per diluted share down 682 million or 40 compared with 17 billion or 452 per diluted share in 2008 the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower income from railway operations that was offset in part by lower income taxes see note 3 railway operating revenues decreased 27 billion reflecting lower traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit primarily a result of decreased fuel surcharges railway operating expenses decreased 16 billion principally due to lower volumerelated expenses and fuel prices 

oil prices affect ns results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular period in addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume oil prices directly affect ns revenues through marketbased fuel surcharges and contract escalators see railway operating revenues and also affect fuel costs see railway operating expenses for 2009 excluding the impact of decreased consumption the decline in fuel surcharge revenue was greater than the decline in fuel expense future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular year or quarter 

2008 compared with 2007 

net income in 2008 was 17 billion up 252 million or 17 compared with 2007 diluted earnings per share were 452 up 84¢ or 23 the greater percentage increase in per share earnings was due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of ns share repurchase program see note 14 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes see note 3 railway operating revenues increased 12 billion as higher average revenue per unit outweighed lower traffic volumes railway operating expenses increased 730 million principally due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and benefits expenses 

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

railway operating revenues were 80 billion in 2009 107 billion in 2008 and 94 billion in 2007 the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volume and average revenue per unit by market group 

 

revenues decreased 27 billion in 2009 but increased 12 billion in 2008 as reflected in the table on the following page the decrease in 2009 was due to decreased traffic volumes and lower average revenue per unit as a result of lower fuel surcharges that more than offset rate increases the improvement in 2008 was the result of increased average revenue per unit including fuel surcharge revenue which more than offset decreased traffic volumes fuel surcharge revenue amounted to 370 million in 2009 compared with 16 billion in 2008 and 792 million in 2007 if fuel prices remain at or near yearend 2009 levels fuel surcharge revenues will increase in 2010 

many of ns negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise traffic are based on the monthly average price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti average price these surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the wti average price for the second preceding calendar month this twomonth lag in applying wti average price decreased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 50 million in 2009 and increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 100 million in 2008 

 

for 2009 the unfavorable volume variance accounted for 75 of the total variance reflecting traffic volume declines for all commodity groups volumes declined by 14 million units or 19 reflecting the weakened economy the unfavorable revenue per unitmix variance was driven by decreased fuel surcharges offset in part by higher rates 

in 2008 revenues increased 12 billion compared to 2007 reflecting large increases in average revenue per unit a result of higher rates and increased fuel surcharges traffic volumes for all commodity groups except coal and agricultureconsumer productsgovernment decreased compared to 2007 

on january 26 2007 the surface transportation board stb issued a decision that the type of fuel surcharge imposed by ns and most other large railroads  a fuel surcharge based on a percentage of line haul revenue  would no longer be permitted for regulated traffic that moves under public tariff rates the stb gave the railroads a 90day transition period to adjust their fuel surcharge programs during the second quarter of 2007 ns discontinued assessing fuel surcharges on its published nonintermodal public rates adjustments to public prices now reflect ongoing market conditions the traffic moving under these tariffs and public quotes comprises about 10 of ns total revenue base 

coal revenues decreased 847 million or 27 compared with 2008 reflecting a 20 decrease in traffic volume due to lower coal consumption in the utility and global raw steel sectors and lower average revenue per unit coal average revenue per unit was down 9 compared with 2008 reflecting decreased fuel surcharges and declining rate adjustment factors that more than offset rate increases for 2010 average revenue per unit is expected to increase reflecting the effects of higher rates comprised of pricing increases increasing contract escalators higher fuel surcharges and increased length of haul for export coal traffic 

coal represented 29 of ns revenues in 2009 and 80 of shipments handled originated on ns lines as shown in the following table tonnage declined in all coal markets 

 

in 2008 coal revenues increased 796 million or 34 compared with 2007 reflecting higher rates including fuel surcharges and a 4 increase in traffic volume coal average revenue per unit was up 29 compared with 2007 reflecting higher rates which were comprised of pricing increases contract escalators and the effect of increased longerhaul export coal traffic and increased fuel surcharges 

ns was recently involved in litigation with virginia electric and power companyold dominion electric cooperative virginia power regarding rate adjustment provisions in a transportation contract between them ns was also recently involved in litigation with a coal customer to enforce provisions of a transportation contract related to reimbursement of certain infrastructure expenses incurred by ns and minimum tonnage commitments and related deficit charges ns settled both of these matters during the fourth quarter of 2009 the settlements did not have a material impact on ns financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

utility coal tonnage decreased 17 compared with 2008 a result of lower demand for electricity induced by the downturn in the us economy natural gas competition and utility coal stockpiles that were above target levels across ns service area 

in 2008 utility coal tonnage increased 1 compared with 2007 as a result of modest stockpile growth in the northeast 

for 2010 ns expects electricity demand and natural gas prices to increase which should lead to higher coalfired generation and demand however utility coal tonnage may lag this recovery due to high stockpile levels at least through the first half of the year 

export coal tonnage decreased 22 compared to 2008 reflecting the global recession reduced demand for steel production and high inventory levels norfolk volume decreased about 34000 carloads or 20 and baltimore volume was down about 21000 carloads or 38 

in 2008 export coal tonnage increased 48 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased global demand coupled with weatherrelated supply constraints in australia reduced export volume from china and the weak us dollar norfolk volume increased about 51000 carloads or 39 and baltimore volume was up about 28000 carloads or 102 

for 2010 export coal tonnage is expected to increase reflecting improved demand for raw steel production 

domestic metallurgical coal  coke and iron ore tonnage decreased 35 compared with 2008 reflecting reduced demand for raw steel caused by the downturn in the us economy which led to blast furnace outages reduced coke production schedules and high inventory levels 

in 2008 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage increased 2 compared with 2007 reflecting the start up of a new coke plant 

for 2010 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage is expected to improve as the economy continues to recover resulting in increased demand for raw steel production 

other coal tonnage principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants decreased 12 compared to 2008 principally due to reduced production at nsserved plants caused by the downturn in the us economy in 2008 other coal tonnage decreased 13 compared to 2007 primarily due to coal supply constraints 

for 2010 other coal tonnage is expected to be down compared to 2009 reflecting reduced industrial coal consumption 

general merchandise revenues in 2009 decreased 13 billion or 24 compared with 2008 reflecting a 21 decline in traffic volume and a 3 decrease in average revenue per unit as higher rates were overshadowed by decreased fuel surcharge revenues 

in 2008 general merchandise revenues increased 296 million or 6 compared with 2007 as a 15 increase in average revenue per unit reflecting continued marketbased pricing and higher fuel surcharges more than offset an 8 decline in traffic 

agriculture consumer products and government revenues decreased 8 in 2009 compared with 2008 the revenue decline resulted from an 8 decrease in traffic volumes as plant closures and production curtailments led to fewer shipments of fertilizer and corn 

in 2008 agriculture consumer products and government revenues increased 22 compared with 2007 the revenue improvement resulted from higher average revenue per unit which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenues traffic volume increased 2 as more ethanol military feed soybeans and food oils shipments offset declines in fertilizers corn beverages and consumer products 

for 2010 agriculture revenues are expected to increase as a result of increased volumes and higher average revenue per unit reflecting expected growth in the agrifuels market including corn for ethanol production and finished ethanol as well as increased fertilizer shipments 

chemicals revenues in 2009 decreased 15 compared with 2008 due to a 12 decrease in traffic volume and a 3 decline in average revenue per unit primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges the decline in traffic volume was a result of continued weakness in housing construction which drove declines in industrial intermediates plastics and miscellaneous chemicals volumes associated with petroleumbased products also declined as a result of reduced demand for asphalt and production curtailments 

in 2008 chemicals revenue increased 6 compared with 2007 a result of increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue traffic volume declined 8 reflecting continued weakness in both industrial intermediates and plastics linked to housing construction declines in addition to miscellaneous chemicals and petroleumbased products 

for 2010 chemicals revenues are expected to improve principally due to higher average revenue per unit and modestly increased traffic volumes 

metals and construction revenues decreased 40 in 2009 reflecting a 32 decrease in traffic volume and a 12 decline in average revenue per unit primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges the decline in traffic volume was principally due to lower coil scrap metal iron and steel shipments in addition to reduced demand for construction materials as a result of continued weakness in the housing infrastructure and automotive sectors 

in 2008 metals and construction revenues increased 9 as a 15 increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from increased rates and higher fuel surcharge more than offset the effects of a 5 decrease in traffic volume the decline in volume was due to reduced demand for construction materials and lower coil iron and steel shipments reflecting the weak housing and automotive sectors 

for 2010 metals and construction revenues are expected to increase as a result of a rise in average revenue per unit and higher constructionrelated traffic volumes due to growth driven by increased federal and state infrastructure projects and recovery in residential construction 

paper clay and forest products revenues decreased 26 in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a 22 decrease in traffic volumes and a 5 decline in average revenue per unit primarily a result of lower fuel surcharges the volume decline reflected lower pulp board lumber kaolin printing paper and wood chip shipments due to reduced u s paper production and the slowdown in the housing market 

in 2008 paper clay and forest products revenues increased 4 compared with 2007 due to a 13 increase in average revenue per unit which more than offset an 8 decrease in traffic volume the volume decline reflected the continued housing slowdown and increased trucking capacity available to paper customers 

for 2010 paper clay and forest products revenues are expected to be modestly higher as slight average revenue per unit increases will be offset in part by slightly lower volumes driven by expectations for a gradual economic recovery during the course of the year as the housing market rebounds from historical lows 

automotive revenues decreased 36 in 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting lower traffic volumes and decreased average revenue per unit as fuel surcharges were lower volumes decreased 30 primarily as a result of a 32 decrease in north american light vehicle production as manufacturers cut production in line with consumer demand 

in 2008 automotive revenues decreased 16 compared to 2007 as lower traffic volumes offset higher average revenue per unit volumes decreased 23 reflecting reduced north american sales and production automotive manufacturers especially the domestic producers continued to experience significant sales declines during the year three assembly plants closed during the year and six implemented shift reductions in addition one manufacturer temporarily closed an assembly plant to retool for a new product in 2010 

for 2010 automotive revenues are expected to increase driven by higher average revenue per unit related to network changes and the renegotiation of several contracts automotive volumes are expected to remain relatively flat 

intermodal revenues decreased 528 million or 26 compared with 2008 reflecting a 16 reduction in traffic volume and an 11 decrease in average revenue per unit in 2009 all intermodal segments experienced depressed volumes reflecting the weak economy and lower consumer demand international traffic volume declined 30 premium business which includes parcel and lessthantruckload ltl carriers decreased 14 triple crown services triple crown a service with railtohighway trailers experienced a 10 drop in volume and domestic volume which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies volumes decreased less than 1 

in 2008 intermodal revenues increased 137 million or 7 compared with 2007 as a 10 increase in average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges offset a 3 reduction in traffic volumes domestic volume increased 8 compared with 2007 reflecting the relative fuel efficiency of intermodal versus overtheroad transportation and service improvements international traffic volume declined 9 primarily driven by the weak economy and less inland rail movement of west coast port traffic that was partially offset by east coast port volume growth the premium business which includes parcel and ltl carriers decreased 6 as reduced private empty movements and soft parcel business offset ltl conversions triple crown a service with railtohighway trailers experienced a 3 drop in volume primarily driven by reduced auto parts shipments 

for 2010 intermodal revenues are expected to experience a moderate increase due to higher average revenue per unit and volumes as a result of a slowly strengthening economy 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses in 2009 were 6 billion down 16 billion or 21 compared to 2008 expenses in 2008 were 76 billion up 730 million or 11 compared to 2007 the decrease in 2009 was primarily due to lower volumerelated expenses and lower fuel prices the increase in 2008 was primarily due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and benefits expenses the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses rose to 754 in 2009 compared with 711 in 2008 and 726 in 2007 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

 

compensation and benefits which represents 40 of total operating expenses decreased 283 million or 11 compared with 2008 primarily due to lower volumerelated payroll down 217 million reduced incentive and stockbased compensation down 117 million the absence of the cost of lumpsum payments due under the 2008 brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet agreement 31 million and lower payroll taxes down 26 million these decreases were partially offset by increased wage rates up 53 million increased pension costs up 42 million and higher medical benefits up 25 million 

in 2008 compensation and benefits increased 132 million or 5 compared with 2007 primarily due to higher incentive compensation up 66 million increased wage rates up 54 million costs associated with lumpsum payments due under the blet agreement higher payroll taxes up 15 million and the absence of the 2007 employment tax refund 9 million these were partially offset by lower costs associated with trainees down 19 million lower medical benefits resulting from higher employee contributions down 19 million and lower stockbased compensation down 7 million in 2008 compensation and benefits expense also benefited from a net pension credit of 39 million 

ns employment averaged 28593 in 2009 compared with 30709 in 2008 and 30806 in 2007 the 2009 decrease was a direct result of volume declines during the year ns monitors forecasted volumes in light of current economic conditions to ensure appropriate employment levels for service needs for 2010 ns expects agreement wages and premiums for medical benefits combined will increase by approximately 148 million compared to 2009 

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses decreased 196 million or 12 in 2009 compared to 2008 but increased 48 million or 3 in 2008 compared to 2007 

purchased services costs were 1087 billion in 2009 1242 billion in 2008 and 1172 billion in 2007 the decrease in 2009 reflected lower volumerelated expenses such as transportation operating costs including automotiverelated costs and crew transportation expenses intermodal operations costs and mechanical and engineering expenses largely because of reduced maintenance activities these declines were offset in part by increased professional and legal services the increase in 2008 reflected higher intermodal operations costs transportation operating costs and professional and legal services 

equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment amounted to 316 million 357 million and 379 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in 2009 and 2008 was principally due to lower shipment volumes while 2008 also reflected improved fleet utilization 

fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations decreased 913 million or 56 in 2009 compared with 2008 but increased 469 million or 40 in 2008 compared with 2007 the decline in 2009 was principally the result of lower fuel prices which had an impact of 600 million and reduced fuel consumption which had an impact of 313 million the increase in 2008 reflected higher fuel prices which had an impact of 511 million that was offset in part by a decline in consumption which had an impact of 42 million locomotive fuel prices declined 47 in 2009 compared with a 45 increase in 2008 and locomotive fuel consumption was down 19 in 2009 and 3 in 2008 

depreciation expense increased 33 million or 4 in 2009 compared to 2008 and 29 million or 4 in 2008 compared to 2007 reflecting substantial capital investments and improvements as ns continues to invest in its infrastructure and equipment 

materials and other expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters decreased 211 million or 25 in 2009 compared with 2008 but increased 52 million or 7 in 2008 compared with 2007 as shown in the following table 

 

the decrease in 2009 reflects lower locomotive freight car and roadway materials expenses lower loss and damage claims favorable personal injury claims development reduced employee travel costs a 21 million favorable adjustment related to settlement of a multiyear state tax dispute and the absence of the 2008 avondale mills settlement see additional discussion below 

the increase in 2008 was primarily due to costs associated with the avondale mills settlement as well as higher loss and damage claims and increased material costs for equipment and roadway repairs these increases were partially offset by favorable personal injury claims development 

in april 2008 ns settled the lawsuit brought by avondale mills for claims associated with the january 6 2005 derailment in graniteville sc a portion of the settlement was not reimbursed by insurance and was included in 2008 expenses the total liability related to the derailment represents ns best estimate based on current facts and circumstances the estimate includes amounts related to property damage personal injury and response costs ns commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment above the unreimbursed portion and ns selfinsured retention including ns response costs and legal fees the consolidated balance sheets reflect longterm receivables for estimated recoveries from ns insurance carriers ns is engaged in arbitration with two of its insurance carriers that failed to respond to insurance claims submitted by ns ns believes these expenses are covered by the insurance policies and recoveries of the contested amounts are probable accordingly ns has recorded the full recovery attributable to each carrier 100 million and 43 million 

the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 48 of total employee injury cases resolved and about 19 of total payments made with its longestablished commitment to safety ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs with respect to occupational injuries which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads felas faultbased system which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers compensation system 

ns maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims it also retains reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance see note 17 ns expects insurance costs to be slightly higher in 2010 

other income  net 

other income  net was 127 million in 2009 110 million in 2008 and 93 million in 2007 see note 2 the increase in 2009 reflected higher net returns from corporateowned life insurance up 32 million offset in part by fewer gains on the sale of property down 11 million 

the increase in 2008 reflected the absence of expenses related to synthetic fuel adjustments see income taxes below reduced other interest expense 27 million largely due to adjustments to reflect the outcome of certain tax examinations and higher coal royalties up 12 million these benefits were offset in part by lower returns and higher borrowing costs on corporateowned life insurance down 38 million lower interest income down 25 million fewer gains on sales of property and investments down 22 million and lower equity in the earnings of conrail down 16 million which reflects the absence of a tax audit settlement recorded by conrail in 2007 18 million 

ns has membership interests representing ownership in companies that owned and operated facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal in addition ns purchased two facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal in 2007 the production of synthetic fuel resulted in tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments the expenses are recorded as a component of other income  net and the tax credits as well as tax benefits related to the expenses are reflected in provision for income taxes see further discussion below 

income taxes 

income tax expense in 2009 was 588 million for an effective rate of 36 compared with effective rates of 38 in 2008 and 35 in 2007 the decrease in the rate for 2009 was primarily due to improved net returns from corporateowned life insurance and the favorable resolution of state tax issues the increase in the rate for 2008 was primarily due to the absence of synthetic fuelrelated tax credits that expired at the end of 2007 

the tax credits generated by ns synthetic fuelrelated investments reduced the effective tax rate by 3 in 2007 net income in 2007 reflected 13 million in net benefits from these credits as shown below 

 

bonus depreciation was allowed for federal income taxes for 2008 and 2009 but expired at the end of 2009 as a result current taxes have been lower in recent years than might be expected in future years 

during 2009 the internal revenue service irs concluded its examination of ns 2006 and 2007 consolidated federal income tax returns without a material effect on income tax expense ns consolidated federal income tax return for 2008 is being audited by the irs 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities ns principal source of liquidity was 19 billion in 2009 compared with 27 billion in 2008 and 23 billion in 2007 the decline in 2009 reflects the 11 billion decrease in income from railway operations offset in part by lower income tax payments the improvement in 2008 resulted from increased railway operating income and from bonus tax depreciation which reduced current tax payments ns had working capital of 457 million at december 31 2009 compared with a working capital deficit of 106 million at december 31 2008 the improvement was largely due to higher cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances at year end as well as the impact of lower income from railway operations that resulted in decreases in current income taxes and accounts payable offset in part by decreases in accounts receivable and increases in shortterm debt ns expects that cash on hand combined with cash flow provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations ns cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances totaled 11 billion and 618 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

contractual obligations at december 31 2009 comprised of ns longterm debt including capital leases see note 8 operating leases see note 9 agreements with crc and longterm advances from conrail see note 5 unconditional purchase obligations see note 17 and unrecognized tax benefits see note 3were as follows 

 

 when the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period when the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the other column 

off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 9 

cash used in investing activities was 15 billion in 2009 compared with 12 billion in 2008 and 1 billion in 2007 the increase in 2009 primarily reflected lower proceeds from investment sales and higher investment purchases offset in part by lower property additions the increase in 2008 primarily reflected increased property additions 

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 

 

 

 

for 2010 ns has budgeted 144 billion for capital expenditures the anticipated spending includes 706 million for roadway projects including the normalized replacement of rail ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges planned investments in facilities and terminals of 184 million are primarily for intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network including the crescent corridor initiative and bulk transfer facilities and mechanical service shops technology investments of 140 million are planned for new or upgraded systems and computers the majority of the anticipated spending on technology investments is attributable to preliminary implementation of positive train control infrastructure investments of 110 million are planned for various publicprivate partnership investments such as the heartland corridor and the chicago regional environmental and transportation efficiency create project and network improvements to increase mainline capacity and accommodate traffic growth ns also expects to spend 81 million on equipment primarily continued improvements to the locomotive fleet including the rebuild and upgrade of existing units all capital expenditures are expected to be made with internally generated funds ns expects implementation of positive train control to result in additional capital expenditures of at least 700 million in the years 2011 through 2015 

the heartland corridor is a package of proposed clearance improvements and other facilities that will create a seamless highcapacity intermodal route across virginia and west virginia to midwest markets during 2006 ns the federal highway administration fhwa and the states of ohio west virginia and virginia entered into a memoranda of agreement with respect to the tunnel clearance component of the heartland corridor that governs the release of up to 95 million in authorized federal funding in 2006 ns also entered into agreements with two states governing the use of up to 11 million in state funding for the heartland corridor rail doublestack clearance project ns began work on the heartland corridor tunnel clearances in october 2007 and the entire project is expected to be completed in 2010 ns expects to spend about 23 million in 2010 in connection with this project 

the create project is a publicprivate partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan chicago area ns and other railroads have agreed to participate in create a portion of public funding has been approved and the parties have developed a list of projects to be included in phase i of the project a total of 100 million in public funding has been secured for phase i and the railroads have contributed an additional 100 million the railroads expect to complete phase i by the end of 2011 as currently planned the total project is estimated to cost 31 billion with city state and federal support if additional public funding is secured the railroads are expected to contribute a total of 169 million towards the entire project ns expects to spend approximately 11 million in 2010 related to the create projects 

the meridian speedway is a 320mile rail line between meridian mississippi and shreveport louisiana on may 1 2006 ns and kansas city southern kcs formed a joint venture meridian speedway llc msllc pursuant to which ns will contribute 300 million in cash substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements in exchange for a 30 interest in the joint venture to date ns has contributed 283 million at the formation of msllc kcs contributed the meridian speedway ns is recognizing its pro rata share of the joint ventures earnings or loss as required under the equity method of accounting ns total investment in msllc is supported by the fair value of the rail line as well as intangible assets obtained through the transaction the joint venture increases capacity and is designed to improve service over the meridian speedway into the southeast 

during the second quarter of 2009 ns and pan am railways inc pan am formed a joint venture pan am southern llc pas a railroad company in which each has a 50 equity interest pan am contributed to pas a 155mile main line track that runs between mechanicville new york and ayer massachusetts along with 281 miles of secondary and branch lines including trackage rights in new york connecticut massachusetts new hampshire and vermont collectively the pas lines and as of december 31 2009 ns has contributed cash and other property with a combined value of approximately 69 million and committed to contribute an additional 71 million in cash over the next three years as evidenced by the pan am notes see note 8 a significant portion of ns contributions has and will continue to be used for capital improvements to the pas lines and the related construction of new intermodal and automotive terminals in albany new york and the ayer massachusetts areas pas is jointly controlled by ns and pan am accordingly ns accounts for its interest in pas using the equity method of accounting 

the crescent corridor consists of a program of improvements to infrastructure and other facilities geared toward creating a seamless highcapacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from new jersey to louisiana and offering truckcompetitive service along several major interstate highway corridors including i81 i85 i20 i40 i59 and i75 based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief ns plans to implement certain elements of the crescent corridor program of projects through a series of publicprivate partnerships although there is not yet a single integrated plan for the crescent corridor preliminary work has begun and is slated to continue in 2010 including continued infrastructure improvements and other design and engineering work along the virginia portion of the corridor consistent with ns matching obligation with respect to funds provided by the commonwealth of virginia if requested publicprivate partnership agreements are funded in 2010 ns capital expenditures in 2010 related to crescent corridor projects may be as high as 41 million 

the midamerica corridor is a proposed cooperative arrangement between ns and canadian national railway cn to effectively share track between chicago st louis kentucky and mississippi in order to establish more efficient routes for traffic moving between the midwestern and southeastern us including potential coal traffic moving to nsserved southeastern utility plants from cnserved illinois basin coal producers to implement the midamerica corridor ns at its option would expend funds to upgrade the rail line operated by west tennessee railway between fulton kentucky and corinth mississippi a line over which ns would operate pursuant to recently obtained trackage rights full implementation of the midamerica corridor arrangement is subject to regulatory approvals 

cash used in financing activities was 31 million in 2009 compared with 11 billion in 2008 and 16 billion in 2007 the change in 2009 reflected the absence of share repurchase activity during the period and higher borrowings net of debt repayments that were offset in part by fewer exercises of employee stock options and increased dividends due to current economic and market conditions the amount of future share repurchases is uncertain and the timing and volume of such repurchases will be guided by managements assessment of market conditions and other pertinent factors the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2008 reflected a net increase in debt compared with a net decline in 2007 which was offset in part by higher dividend payments 

during the second quarter of 2009 ns issued 500 million of unsecured notes at 590 due 2019 pursuant to its automatic shelf registration statement described below see note 8 the net proceeds from the offering were 496 million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses ns also issued a total of 75 million in noninterest bearing notes payable with maturity dates beginning in 2010 and ending in 2012 as part of its total investment in pan am southern llc 

during the first quarter of 2009 ns issued 500 million of unsecured notes at 575 due 2016 in a private offering the net proceeds from the offering were 494 million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses during the fourth quarter of 2009 ns exchanged the unregistered securities with essentially identical securities registered under the securities act of 1933 

ns has authority from its board of directors to issue an additional 500 million of debt or equity securities through public or private sale during the first quarter of 2009 ns filed a form s3 automatic shelf registration statement for wellknown seasoned issuers under which as of december 31 2009 up to 500 million could be issued under this authority 

ns also has in place and available a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement expiring in 2012 which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants ns had no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2009 and ns is in compliance with all of its covenants in october 2009 ns renewed and amended its accounts receivable securitization program with a 364day term to run until october 2010 ns reduced the total amount that can be borrowed from 500 million to 350 million to more closely match its liquidity requirements and receivables profile there was 200 million outstanding under this program at december 31 2009 see note 8 

looking forward ns annual debt maturities are relatively modest and stable from year to year see note 8 overall ns goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support ns business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances management regularly discusses the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance management utilizes an independent consulting actuarial firms studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 

ns net pension expense which is included in compensation and benefits in its consolidated statements of income was 1 million for the year ended december 31 2009 in recording this amount ns assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 875 which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 16 million change to the pension expense and as a result an equal change in compensation and benefits expense changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns net pension expense or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments ns utilizes an analysis in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans were matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds ns used the results of the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches the payment stream of the benefits in these plans 

ns net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in compensation and benefits was 91 million for the year ended december 31 2009 in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits which is included in other postretirement benefits management estimated future increases in healthcare costs these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note 11 

properties and depreciation 

most of ns total assets are longlived railway properties see note 6 as disclosed in note 1 ns properties are depreciated using group depreciation rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by grosston miles other properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value 

ns depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement in developing these assumptions ns management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an outside firm of consulting engineers these studies analyze ns historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices ns recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense the studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property ns depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2009 amounted to 837 million ns weightedaverage depreciation rates for 2009 are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 29 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense 

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

ns expense for casualties and other claims included in materials and other amounted to 102 million for the year ended december 31 2009 most of this expense was ns accrual related to personal injury liabilities jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to fela which is applicable only to railroads felas faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded in all cases ns records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable 

to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during each period ns management utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm for employee personal injury cases the actuarial firm studies ns historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences an estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims is based on the results of this analysis for occupational injury claims the actuarial firm studies ns history of claim filings severity payments and other relevant facts additionally the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting ns experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which ns would recognize when such a change became known recent actuarial studies have reflected favorable claims development and accordingly those changes in estimates have reduced the annual cost related to personal injuries to 51 million in 2009 from 78 million in 2008 while the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower 

ns is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations it is ns policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 17 claims if any against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by ns are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the consolidated balance sheets and are not netted against the associated ns liability environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy 

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately 20 million in 2009 18 million in 2008 and 16 million in 2007 and capital expenditures for environmental matters totaled approximately 11 million in 2009 and 7 million in both 2008 and 2007 capital expenditures for environmental matters in 2010 are expected to be about 9 million 

ns consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of 32 million at december 31 2009 and 42 million at december 31 2008 of which 12 million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period at december 31 2009 the liability represents ns estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 144 known locations as of that date nine sites accounted for 15 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period 

at 30 locations one or more ns subsidiaries usually in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statutes which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs 

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss and that participants ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities 

on april 24 2008 the united states department of justice doj brought an action against ns for alleged violations of federal environmental laws resulting from the discharge of chlorine and oil that occurred as a result of the january 6 2005 derailment in graniteville sc including claims for civil penalties as well as injunctive relief although ns june 24 2008 motion to dismiss for failure to allege sufficient facts was granted doj was given leave to and did amend its complaint the litigation has been stayed by the district court as the parties work to conclude an agreed upon consent decree ns does not believe that the resolution of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity 

based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which ns is aware further management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to expenses while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments in managements opinion the recorded liability if any is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

income taxes 

ns net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 67 billion at december 31 2009 see note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized ns had a 14 million valuation allowance on 871 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2009 reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized 

in addition ns has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded for every one half percent change in the 2009 effective tax rate net income would have changed by 8 million 

other matters 

labor agreements 

more than 80 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act rla ns largely bargains nationally in concert with other major railroads moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose changes 

ns reached national agreements that extended through 2009 with all of the major rail unions the current agreement with the blet extends through 2014 because ns has reached separate agreements with the blet and the american train dispatchers association atda only the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements apply to ns locomotive engineers and atdarepresented dispatchers ns has also reached agreement with longshoremen at ashtabula ohio docks who are represented by the international longshoremens association ila and do not participate in national bargaining on or after november 1 2009 ns and the nations other major carriers served new proposals to begin the next round of negotiations the outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at this point 

market risks and hedging activities 

ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments and by entering into interestrate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio 

at december 31 2009 ns debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 204 million a 1 point increase in interest rates would increase ns total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately 2 million management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

some of ns capital leases which carry an average fixed rate of 7 were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements on december 31 2009 the average pay rate under these agreements was 1 and the average receive rate was 6 during 2009 and 2008 the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by less than 1 million in both periods a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yendenominated obligation most of these deposits are held by foreign banks primarily japanese as a result ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy 

inflation 

in preparing financial statements us generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property ns a capitalintensive company has most of its capital invested in such property the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

proposed legislation and regulations on safety and transportation of hazardous materials 

federal regulations were adopted in late 2008 on safety and transportation of hazardous materials ns is in compliance with those regulations currently effective and expects to be in compliance with those regulations to become effective at a later date

environmental matters  compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal ns goal to date such compliance has not affected materially ns’ capital additions earnings liquidity or competitive position see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 “personal injury environmental and legal liabilities” in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees – the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits

government regulation  in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses ns’ railroads are subject to regulation by the stb the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers the federal railroad administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards 

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads begun over two decades ago under the staggers rail act of 1980 includes exemptions of intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar traffic lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing transportation contracts on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the duration of the contract about 86 of ns’ freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts 

efforts were made in 2008 to resubject the rail industry to increased federal economic regulation and such efforts are expected to continue in 2009 the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially balanced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly ns will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation 

competition – there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprocess users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

ns’ primary rail competitor is the csx system both operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory ns also competes with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage 

certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations – ns has taken significant steps to provide enhanced security for the ns rail system in particular ns has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents the ns departmental security plan outlines the protocol within ns for all concerned to be notified of aar alert level changes all ns operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

the ns plan also effectively addresses and complies with department of transportation security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials as part of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and recertification programs toward that end ns working closely with the national transit institute at rutgers university has developed a fourmodule uniform national training program ns also has worked with the transportation security administration tsa in developing other industry training programs more indepth security training has been given to those select ns employees who have been given specific security responsibilities and additional locationspecific security plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and each of six port facilities served by ns with respect to the ports each facility plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

additionally ns engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the tsa the federal bureau of investigation fbi the federal railroad administration fra the us coast guard us customs and border protection and various state homeland security offices as one notable example an ns police special agent under the auspices of the aar has been assigned to the national joint terrorism task force njttf operating out of fbi headquarters in washington dc to represent and serve as liaison to the north american rail industry this arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole while having the post filled by an ns special agent has served to foster a strong working relationship between ns and the fbi ns also has become a member of the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat program sponsored by us customs ctpat allows ns to work closely with us customs and its customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on ns particularly those moving to or from a foreign country based on participation in ctpat ns has ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by us customs 

similarly ns is guided in its operations by various supplemental security action items issued by dhs and us department of transportation dot us coast guard maritime security requirements as well as voluntary security action items developed in 2006 in collaboration with tsa dot and the freight railroads many of the action items are based on lessons learned from dhs and dot security assessments of rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua begun in 2004 particular attention is paid to 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify through risk assessments those locations where security risks are the highest these action items and ns’ compliance initiatives are outlined in the various departmental sections of the ns departmental security plan ns is also taking the appropriate actions to ensure compliance with the 2008 tsa final rule addressing rail security sensitive materials and the 2008 pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration  phmsa railrouting regulations outlined in docket hm232e 

in 2008 through participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response transcaer program ns provided rail accident response training to approximately 4300 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel representing over 25000 manhours of emergency response training ns also conducted railroad operations classes for fbi agents and the railroad liaison agents from joint terrorism task forces ns’ other training efforts throughout 2008 included participation in 15 drills including 2 major fullscale exercises with various local state and federal agencies conducted in accordance with the dhs exercise and evaluation program ns also has ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at tank car emergency response training programs conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo colorado also the ns annual transcaer whistlestop train makes stops in numerous cities its special training cars serving as a resource to an audience of nearly 1000 emergency responders annually 

improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration  phmsa in coordination with the fra is amending the hazardous materials regulations to prescribe enhanced safety measures for rail transportation of tih materials including interim design standards for railroad tank cars the rule mandates commodityspecific improvements in safety features and design standards for newly manufactured dot specification tank cars and an improved top fittings performance standard the interim standards established in this rule will enhance the accident survivability of tih tank cars

ns is subject to significant governmental legislation and regulation over commercial environmental and operating matters railroads are subject to the enactment of laws by congress that could increase economic regulation of the industry railroads presently are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has jurisdiction over some routes rates and fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers additional economic regulation of the rail industry by congress or the stb whether under new or existing laws could have a significant negative impact on ns’ ability to determine prices for rail services and result in a material adverse effect in the future on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter this potential material adverse effect could also result in reduced capital spending on ns’ rail network 

railroads are subject to safety and security regulation by the dot and the dhs which regulate most aspects of ns’ operations compliance with the rail safety improvement act of 2008 will result in additional operating costs associated with the statutory mandate to implement positive train control by 2015 in addition ns’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on ns 

ns’ operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to waterways or ground water supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions past present and future – is inherent in the railroad business property owned by ns whether currently or in the past is and has been subject to a variety of uses including ns railroad operations and other industrial activity by past owners or past and present tenants of ns environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and ns could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns as a common carrier by rail must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property damage costs and compromise critical parts of our rail network 

ns may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect ns’ results of operations financial position and liquidity in a particular year or quarter because ns plays a critical role in the nation’s transportation system it could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

although ns currently maintains insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism it maintains only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in ns’ care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of ns’ current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses could be unavailable to ns in the future 

ns may be affected by general economic conditions prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities ns carries may have an adverse effect on its operating results financial position and liquidity economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns may be affected by the impact of environmental regulation on its utility coal customers andor the value of certain ns assets a number of evolving environmental issues could affect the us utility coal market including potential regional programs aimed at capping and reducing power plant co 2 emissions and ongoing efforts at addressing climate change although certain utilities have begun adding or are planning to add emissions control technologies to their electric generating units allowing them to utilize their existing coalfired power plants future regulatory developments in this area could have a negative effect on ns’ utility coal customers andor the value of coal reserves owned by ns and thus an adverse effect on ns’ operating results financial position and liquidity 

ns faces competition from other transportation providers ns is subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and the quality and reliability of service while ns has used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain its rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which ns operates or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the operations of carriers with which ns interchanges may adversely affect its operations ns’ ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon its ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue divisions car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in ns’ inability to meet its customers’ demands or require ns to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

ns relies on technology and technology improvements in its business operations if ns experiences significant disruption or failure of one or more of its information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment ns could experience a service interruption security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter additionally if ns does not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if it is unable to implement new technology ns may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the vast majority of ns employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect its operations a pproximately 26000 or about 85 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown ns could experience a significant disruption of its operations additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase ns’ costs for healthcare wages and other benefits any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of ns’ business exposes it to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated 

personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employers’ liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded 

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss or property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on ns’ operating results financial condition and liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance ns has obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages specified levels of risk are retained on a selfinsurance basis currently up to 25 million and above 1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and 25 million and above 175 million per occurrence for property owned by ns or in its care custody or control insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to ns 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes floods fires and earthquakes may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect ns’ operational efficiency and ability to meet demand workforce demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on ns’ ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on ns’ operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of its supplier markets ns consumes about 500 million gallons of diesel fuel each year fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations if a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments increased demand in existing or emerging foreign markets disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or other factors ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter could be materially adversely affected also such an event would impact ns as well as its customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capital intensive nature and industryspecific requirements of the rail industry there are high barriers of entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally ns competes with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials such as rail and ties changes in the competitive landscapes of these limitedsupplier markets could result in increased prices or material shortages that could materially affect ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the state of capital markets could adversely affect ns’ liquidity ns from timetotime relies on the capital markets to provide some of its capital requirements including the issuance of longterm debt instruments and commercial paper as well as the sale of certain receivables significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets including the credit markets or deterioration of ns’ financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or eliminate ns’ access to andor significantly increase the cost of various financing sources including bank credit facilities and issuance of corporate bonds instability or disruptions of the capital markets and deterioration of ns’ financial condition alone or in combination could also result in a reduction in ns’ credit rating to below investment grade which could prohibit or restrict ns from accessing external sources of short and longterm debt financing andor significantly increase the associated costs

norfolk southern corporation and subsidiaries 

management’s discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

overview 

ns’ 2008 net income rose 17 largely on the strength of a 19 increase in income from railway operations operating results reflected higher average revenue per unit including fuel surcharge revenue that more than offset the effects of increased operating expenses and lower traffic volume operating revenues increased 13 and operating expenses rose 11 compared to 2007 resulting in a lower operating ratio a measure of the amount of revenues consumed by expenses of 711 as compared with 726 in 2007 

cash provided by operating activities was 27 billion exceeding 2 billion for the fourth consecutive year coupled with net borrowings of 280 million this provided funding for increased capital expenditures share repurchases and higher dividends 

during 2008 ns purchased and retired 194 million shares of ns common stock at a total cost of 11 billion under the share repurchase program which the board of directors approved in november 2005 and subsequently amended in march 2007 to authorize the repurchase of up to 75 million shares of ns common stock through december 31 2010 in total ns has purchased and retired 647 million shares under this program at a cost of 33 billion 

looking ahead ns expects revenues to decline in 2009 reflecting lower traffic volume due to the weak economy and decreased fuel surcharge revenue resulting from lower fuel prices ns plans to continue to improve service maintain a marketbased approach to pricing and reduce volumerelated costs 

summarized results of operations 

2008 compared with 2007 

net income in 2008 was 17 billion up 252 million or 17 compared with 2007 diluted earnings per share were 452 up 84¢ or 23 the greater percentage increase in per share earnings was due to fewer shares outstanding as a result of ns’ share repurchase program see note 13 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations that was offset in part by higher income taxes see note 3 railway operating revenues increased 12 billion as higher average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges outweighed lower traffic volumes railway operating expenses increased 730 million principally due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and benefits expenses 

oil prices affect ns’ results of operations in a variety of ways and can have an overall favorable or unfavorable impact in any particular quarter or year in addition to the impact of oil prices on general economic conditions and traffic volume oil prices directly affect ns’ revenues through marketbased fuel surcharges and contract escalators see “railway operating revenues” and also affect fuel costs see “railway operating expenses” for 2008 oil prices had an overall favorable impact on income from railway operations future changes in oil prices may cause volatility in operating results that could be material to a particular quarter or year 

2007 compared with 2006 

net income in 2007 was 15 billion down 17 million or 1 compared with 2006 diluted earnings per share were 368 up 11¢ or 3 reflecting fewer shares outstanding as a result of ns’ share repurchase program see note 13 the decrease in net income was primarily due to higher income taxes and lower non‑operating items that offset higher income from railway operations railway operating revenues increased 25 million as higher average revenue per unit overshadowed lower traffic volumes railway operating expenses decreased 3 million principally due to lower volumerelated expenses that offset higher fuel expense 

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

railway operating revenues were 107 billion in 2008 and 94 billion in 2007 and 2006 the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volume and average revenue per unit by market group 

 

revenues increased 12 billion in 2008 and 25 million in 2007 as shown in the table below both revenue improvements were the result of increased average revenue per unit including fuel surcharge revenue which more than offset decreased traffic volumes fuel surcharge revenue amounted to 16 billion in 2008 up 830 million compared to 792 million in 2007 and 1 billion in 2006 if fuel prices remain at or near yearend 2008 levels fuel surcharge revenues in 2009 will be substantially lower with a corresponding effect on revenue per unit 

many of norfolk southern’s negotiated fuel surcharges for coal and general merchandise traffic are based on the monthly average price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti average price these surcharges are reset the first day of each calendar month based on the wti average price for the second preceding calendar month this twomonth lag in computing wti average price coupled with the sharp drop in fuel prices late in the year increased fuel surcharge revenue by approximately 100 million for the year 

 

both comparisons reflect large increases in average revenue per unit a result of higher rates and increased fuel surcharges traffic volumes in both years declined for 2008 traffic volumes for all commodity groups except coal and agricultureconsumer productsgovernment decreased in 2007 traffic volumes for all commodity groups except agricultureconsumer productsgovernment and chemicals decreased 

on january 26 2007 the surface transportation board stb issued a decision that the type of fuel surcharge imposed by ns and most other large railroads – a fuel surcharge based on a percentage of line haul revenue – would no longer be permitted for regulated traffic that moves under public tariff rates the stb gave the railroads a 90‑day transition period to adjust their fuel surcharge programs during the second quarter of 2007 ns discontinued assessing fuel surcharges on its published nonintermodal public rates adjustments to public prices now reflect ongoing market conditions the traffic moving under these tariffs and public quotes comprises about 10 of norfolk southern’s total revenue base 

coal revenues increased 796 million or 34 compared with 2007 reflecting higher rates including fuel surcharges and a 4 increase in traffic volume coal average revenue per unit was up 29 compared with 2007 reflecting higher rates which were comprised of pricing increases contract escalators and the effect of increased longerhaul export coal traffic and increased fuel surcharges for 2009 average revenue per unit is expected to decline reflecting the effects of lower fuel surcharges and contract escalators 

coal represented 29 of ns’ revenues in 2008 and 79 of shipments handled originated on ns’ lines as shown in the following table increased shipments of export utility and domestic metallurgical coal more than offset lower industrial shipments 

 

coal r evenues in 2007 decreased 15 million or 1 compared with 2006 as a 2 reduction in tonnage handled more than offset a 3 increase in average revenue per unit carloads declined 3 a higher percentage than the change in tonnage handled because of increased average tonnage per car coal represented 25 of ns’ revenues in 2007 and 78 of shipments handled originated on ns’ lines 

ns is currently involved in litigation with virginia electric and power companyold dominion electric cooperative virginia power regarding rate adjustment provisions in a transportation contract between them in 2007 the virginia supreme court issued a decision that remanded the case to the trial court on the grounds that neither of its prior decisions constituted a final order in april 2008 the trial court entered a final order granting ns monetary damages including interest and prescribing the methodology for determining future rates virginia power filed a notice of appeal and the virginia supreme court has agreed to hear the appeal future developments and the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in ns recognizing additional revenues related to this dispute which could have a favorable impact on results of operations in a particular year or quarter 

utility coal tonnage increased 1 compared with 2007 a result of modest stockpile growth in the northeast 

in 2007 utility coal tonnage decreased 4 compared with 2006 reflecting high stockpile levels particularly in the southeast that led to reduced shipments despite fairly strong electric generation up 4 in the ns service region in addition the temporary closure of a major coal mine as well as the loss of business to barge transportation contributed to the decline 

for 2009 utility coal tonnage is expected to weaken with lower electric demand as a result of a weak economy 

export coal tonnage increased 48 compared to 2007 reflecting increased global demand coupled with weatherrelated supply constraints in australia reduced export volume from china and the weak us dollar norfolk volume increased about 51000 carloads or 39 and baltimore volume was up about 28000 carloads or 102 

export coal tonnage in 2007 increased 25 compared to 2006 primarily due to increased demand reflecting a lower valued us dollar as well as loading delays at australian ports norfolk volume increased by approximately 26000 cars or 25 and baltimore volume was up approximately 4500 cars or 19 

for 2009 export coal tonnage is expected to decrease reflecting a significant reduction in worldwide steel production increasing competition into europe due to changes in ocean freight rates and the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage increased 2 compared with 2007 reflecting the start up of a new coke plant 

in 2007 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage decreased 14 compared with 2006 the decrease was primarily due to coke furnace outages mine production outages and reduced spot iron ore traffic 

for 2009 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage is expected to be down due to lower domestic steel demand 

other coal tonnage principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants decreased 13 in 2008 compared to 2007 principally due to coal supply constraints in 2007 other coal tonnage increased 6 versus 2006 primarily due to new business and stronger demand 

for 2009 other coal tonnage is expected to be flat compared to 2008 

general merchandise revenues in 2008 increased 296 million or 6 compared with 2007 as a 15 increase in average revenue per unit reflecting continued marketbased pricing and higher fuel surcharges more than offset an 8 decline in traffic volume 

in 2007 general merchandise revenues increased 90 million or 2 compared with 2006 as a 6 increase in average revenue per unit more than offset a 4 decline in traffic volume revenue in 2007 included 26 million related to a volumerelated contract settlement with an automotive customer 

agriculture consumer products and government revenue increased 22 in 2008 compared with 2007 the revenue improvement resulted from higher average revenue per unit which reflected increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenues traffic volume increased 2 as more ethanol military feed soybeans and food oils shipments offset declines in fertilizers corn beverages and consumer products 

agriculture consumer products and government revenue increased 5 in 2007 compared with 2006 the revenue improvement resulted from higher average revenue per unit which reflected higher rates traffic volume rose modestly as more corn fertilizer and ethanol shipments were mitigated by less government and consumer product volume 

for 2009 agriculture revenue is expected to post modest growth benefiting from increasing demand for biofuel products including ethanol biodiesel and feed ingredients from their production and slightly higher average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges however lower volumes in corn soybeans and fertilizer shipments due to softer demand along with declines in consumer products markets are expected to partially offset this growth 

metals and construction revenue increased 9 in 2008 as a 15 increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from increased rates and higher fuel surcharge more than offset the effects of a 5 decrease in traffic volume the decline in volume was due to reduced demand for construction materials and lower coil iron and steel shipments reflecting the weak housing and automotive sectors 

metals and construction revenue decreased 2 in 2007 as a 5 increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from higher rates was more than offset by the effects of a 6 decrease in traffic volume the decline in volume was principally due to lower iron steel and coil shipments and reduced demand for construction materials both reflecting the soft automotive and housing sectors 

for 2009 metals and construction revenues are expected to decline as a result of decreased traffic volumes due to lower steel production in north america coupled with continued weakness in the housing and automotive sectors and lower average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges 

chemicals revenue in 2008 increased 6 compared with 2007 a result of increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue traffic volume declined 8 reflecting continued weakness in both industrial intermediates and plastics linked to housing construction declines in addition to miscellaneous chemicals and petroleumbased products 

in 2007 chemicals revenue increased 8 compared with 2006 reflecting higher rates in all groups traffic volume rose modestly as more shipments of industrial intermediates offset fewer shipments in the petroleum miscellaneous chemicals and plastics markets which continued to reflect weakness in housingrelated demand 

for 2009 chemicals revenue is expected to decline as a result of reduced volumes reflecting a weak economic outlook with fewer housing starts and constructionrelated weaknesses and lower average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges 

paper clay and forest products revenue increased 4 in 2008 compared with 2007 due to a 13 increase in average revenue per unit which more than offset an 8 decrease in traffic volume the volume decline reflected the continued housing slowdown and increased trucking capacity available to paper customers 

paper clay and forest products revenue decreased 3 in 2007 compared with 2006 as the effects of higher average revenue per unit were more than offset by an 8 decrease in traffic volume reflecting the housing slowdown and decline in conventional paper markets 

for 2009 paper clay and forest products revenues are expected to decline due to economyrelated volume declines including the effects of increased trucking capacity and lower average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges 

automotive revenues decreased 16 in 2008 compared to 2007 as lower traffic volumes offset higher average revenue per unit volumes decreased 23 reflecting reduced north american sales and production automotive manufacturers especially the domestic producers continued to experience significant sales declines during the year three assembly plants closed during the year and six implemented shift reductions in addition one manufacturer temporarily closed an assembly plant to retool for a new product in 2010 as of year end ford general motors and chrysler combined operated 14 of 24 assembly plants served by ns ns continues to monitor the state of the automotive industry and the collectability of the associated receivables 

automotive revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006 as lower traffic volumes offset higher average revenue per unit revenue in 2007 included a 26 million volumerelated contract settlement volume decreased 5 reflecting softness in demand for vehicles as well as parts and the closure in june 2007 of an nsserved plant 

for 2009 automotive revenues are expected to decrease reflecting continued production cutbacks and lower average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges 

intermodal revenues increased 137 million or 7 compared with 2007 as a 10 increase in average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges offset a 3 reduction in traffic volumes domestic volume which includes truckload and intermodal marketing companies’ imc volumes increased 8 compared with 2007 reflecting the relative fuel efficiency of intermodal versus overtheroad transportation and service improvements international traffic volume declined 9 primarily driven by the weak economy and less inland rail movement of west coast port traffic that was partially offset by east coast port volume growth the premium business which includes parcel and lessthantruckload ltl carriers decreased 6 as reduced private empty movements and soft parcel business offset ltl conversions triple crown services company triple crown a service with railtohighway trailers experienced a 3 drop in volume primarily driven by reduced auto parts shipments 

intermodal revenues in 2007 decreased 50 million or 3 compared with 2006 as a 4 reduction in traffic volumes offset a 2 increase in average revenue per unit truckload volume decreased 10 compared with 2006 and domestic imc volume declined 4 traffic volume for triple crown dropped 3 the declines for truckload imc and triple crown were primarily due to lower national demand for dry van shipments resulting from continued weakness in the housing and automotive markets and increased overtheroad competition international traffic volume decreased 4 reflecting reduced shipments of empty containers and less inland rail transportation of west coast port traffic which offset volume growth from east coast port traffic premium business was up 2 reflecting gains in parcel shipments that offset modest declines in ltl shipper traffic 

for 2009 intermodal revenue is expected to decrease from 2008 primarily due to weak economic conditions pressures from the drayage market and lower average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses in 2008 were 76 billion up 730 million or 11 compared to 2007 expenses in 2007 were about even with expenses in 2006 the increase in 2008 was primarily due to higher fuel costs and increased compensation and benefits expenses the 2007 comparison reflected volumerelated decreases offset by higher fuel expense 

the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses improved to 711 in 2008 compared with 726 in 2007 and 728 in 2006 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

 

compensation and benefits  which represents 35 of total railway operating expenses increased 132 million or 5 compared with 2007 primarily due to higher incentive compensation up 66 million increased wage rates up 54 million costs associated with lumpsum payments due under a new brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet agreement 31 million higher payroll taxes up 15 million and the absence of the 2007 employment tax refund 9 million these were partially offset by lower costs associated with trainees down 19 million lower health and welfare benefits resulting from higher employee contributions down 19 million and lower stockbased compensation down 7 million in 2008 compensation and benefits expense benefited from a net pension credit of 39 million however primarily due to the market decline in pension assets see note 10 ns does not expect a similar benefit in 2009 

in 2007 compensation and benefits decreased 85 million or 3 compared with 2006 primarily due to lower incentive compensation down 48 million lower volumerelated payroll down 37 million the absence of the prior year retirement and waiver agreements with former executives as well as the cost of the regular stockbased grant to the former chief executive officer 24 million lower stockbased compensation down 13 million and lower payroll taxes down 12 million these were partially offset by increased wage rates up 27 million and higher medical costs up 27 million 

ns employment averaged 30709 in 2008 compared with 30806 in 2007 and 30541 in 2006 the increase in 2007 in the number of employees was almost exclusively in operating department personnel to improve service needs as well as to prepare for expected retirements ns continues to monitor forecasted volumes in light of current economic conditions to ensure appropriate employment levels for service needs 

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses increased 48 million or 3 in 2008 compared to 2007 but decreased 27 million or 2 in 2007 compared to 2006 

purchased services costs were 1242 million in 2008 1172 million in 2007 and 1165 million in 2006 the increase in 2008 reflected higher intermodal operations costs transportation operating costs and professional and legal services in 2007 higher expenses for maintenance activities were largely offset by volumerelated declines 

equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment amounted to 357 million 379 million and 413 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively the decreases in 2008 and 2007 were principally due to lower shipment volumes and improved fleet utilization 

fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations increased 469 million or 40 in 2008 compared with 2007 and increased 74 million or 7 in 2007 compared with 2006 fuel expense is recorded net of hedge benefits although there have been no such benefits since may 2006 when the program wound down see “market risks and hedging activities” below and note 16 the increase in 2008 reflected a 45 increase in the price per gallon of locomotive fuel offset in part by a 3 decline in consumption the increase in 2007 reflected a 9 increase in the price per gallon of locomotive fuel as well as the absence of hedge benefits offset in part by a 4 decline in consumption 

legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2005 repealed the 43¢ per gallon excise tax on railroad diesel fuel for 2007 with the following phased reductions in 2005 and 2006 1¢ per gallon from january 1 2005 through june 30 2005 2¢ per gallon from july 1 2005 through december 31 2006 and by the full 43¢ thereafter ns consumes about 500 million gallons of locomotive diesel fuel per year 

depreciation expense increased 29 million or 4 in 2008 compared to 2007 and 37 million or 5 in 2007 compared to 2006 in both years substantial capital investments and improvements resulted in higher depreciation expense 

materials and other expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters increased 52 million or 7 in 2008 compared with 2007 but decreased 2 million in 2007 compared with 2006 as shown in the following table 

 

the increase in 2008 was primarily due to costs associated with the avondale mills settlement related to the graniteville accident see below as well as higher loss and damage claims and increased material costs for equipment and roadway repairs these increases were partially offset by favorable personal injury claims development 

in april 2008 ns settled the lawsuit brought by avondale mills for claims associated with the january 6 2005 derailment in graniteville sc a portion of the settlement will not be reimbursed by insurance and was included in 2008 expenses the total liability related to the derailment represents ns’ best estimate based on current facts and circumstances the estimate includes amounts related to business property damage and other economic losses personal injury and individual property damage claims as well as thirdparty response costs ns’ commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment above the unreimbursed portion and ns’ selfinsured retention including ns’ response costs and legal fees the consolidated balance sheets reflect current and longterm receivables for estimated recoveries from ns’ insurance carriers ns is engaged in arbitration with one of its insurance carriers that failed to respond to an insurance claim submitted by ns ns believes these expenses are covered by the insurance policy and that recovery of the contested amount is probable in that ns expects the arbitrator will determine the settlement amounts to be reasonable and that the insurer’s refusal to consent to and to fund the settlement was a breach of contract accordingly ns has recorded the full recovery attributable to such carrier 100 million in october 2008 another of ns’ insurance carriers provided the preliminary findings of its review of ns’ reimbursement request and reported that it may dispute a portion of that request ns has initiated arbitration against the carrier and believes that all expenses contained in the reimbursement request are covered by the insurance policy and that recovery is probable 

the decline in materials and other expense in 2007 was primarily due to lower derailment and personal injury costs offset in part by higher property and other taxes and increased materials costs for maintenance activities 

the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 52 of total employee injury cases resolved and about 29 of total payments made with its longestablished commitment to safety ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs with respect to occupational injuries which are not caused by a specific accident or event but allegedly result from a claimed exposure over time the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers’ liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased system which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers’ compensation system 

ns maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims it also retains reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance see note 17 ns expects insurance costs to be slightly higher in 2009 

other income – net 

other income – net was 110 million in 2008 93 million in 2007 and 149 million in 2006 see note 2 the increase in 2008 reflected the absence of expenses related to synthetic fuel investments see “income taxes” below reduced other interest expense 27 million largely due to adjustments to reflect the outcome of certain tax examinations and higher coal royalties up 12 million these benefits were offset in part by lower returns and higher borrowing costs on corporateowned life insurance down 38 million lower interest income down 25 million fewer gains on sales of property and investments down 22 million and lower equity in the earnings of conrail down 16 million which reflects the absence of a tax audit settlement recorded by conrail in 2007 18 million 

the decrease in 2007 reflected lower interest income 31 million higher expenses associated with synthetic fuelrelated tax credit investments 15 million and lower returns from corporateowned life insurance 15 million that combined to offset higher equity in earnings of conrail 20 million 

ns has membership interests representing ownership in companies that owned and operated facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal in addition ns purchased two facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal in 2007 the production of synthetic fuel resulted in tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments the expenses are recorded as a component of “other income – net” and the tax credits as well as tax benefits related to the expenses are reflected in “provision for income taxes” see further discussion below 

income taxes 

income tax expense in 2008 was 1 billion for an effective rate of 38 compared with effective rates of 35 in 2007 and 34 in 2006 the increase in the rate for 2008 was primarily due to the absence of synthetic fuelrelated tax credits that expired at the end of 2007 the increase in the rate for 2007 largely resulted from illinois tax legislation which increased deferred taxes by 19 million see note 3 

the tax credits generated by ns’ synthetic fuelrelated investments reduced the effective tax rate by 3 in 2007 and 2006 net income in 2007 reflected 5 million less in net benefits from these credits as compared with the same period of 2006 as shown below 

 

during 2008 ns resolved both the internal revenue service irs examination of its 2004 and 2005 consolidated federal income tax returns and its appeal of the 2002 and 2003 irs examination without a material effect in income tax expense ns’ consolidated federal income tax returns for 2006 and 2007 are being audited by the irs 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities ns’ principal source of liquidity was 27 billion in 2008 compared with 23 billion in 2007 and 22 billion in 2006 the improvement in 2008 resulted from increased railway operating income and from bonus tax depreciation which reduced current tax payments the improvement in 2007 resulted from favorable changes in working capital as well as a modest increase in income from railway operations ns had working capital deficits of 106 million at december 31 2008 and 273 million at december 31 2007 the improvement was largely the result of increased cash and cash equivalents ns expects that cash on hand combined with cash flow provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations ns’ cash and cash equivalents balances totaled 618 million and 206 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

contractual obligations at december 31 2008 comprised of ns’ longterm debt including capital leases see note 7 operating leases see note 8 agreements with crc see note 4 unrecognized tax benefits see note 3 longterm advances from conrail see note 4 and unconditional purchase obligations see note 17 were as follows 

 

 when the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period when the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the other column 

off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 8 

cash used in investing activities was 12 billion in 2008 compared with 1 billion in 2007 and 684 million in 2006 the increase in 2008 primarily reflected increased property additions the increase in 2007 primarily reflected lower net proceeds from shortterm investment activities and increased property additions 

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 

 

 

 

for 2009 ns has budgeted 141 billion for capital expenditures the anticipated spending includes 698 million for roadway projects including the normalized replacement of rail ties and ballast and the improvement or replacement of bridges planned equipment spending of 124 million provides for the acquisition of over 500 super jumbo covered hoppers and continued spending on improvements to the locomotive fleet including the rebuild and upgrade of existing units planned investments in facilities and terminals total 141 million primarily for intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network and bulk transfer facilities to support the ethanol market infrastructure investments of 170 million are planned for network improvements to increase mainline capacity as well as various publicprivate partnership investments such as the heartland corridor and the chicago create project norfolk southern also expects to spend 67 million related to computers systems and information technology all capital expenditures are expected to be made with internally generated funds 

the heartland corridor is a package of proposed clearance improvements and other facilities that will create a seamless highcapacity intermodal route across virginia and west virginia to midwest markets during 2006 ns and the states of ohio west virginia and virginia each entered into a memorandum of agreement with the federal highway administration with respect to the tunnel clearance component of the heartland corridor that governs the release of up to 95 million in authorized federal funding in 2006 ns also entered into agreements with two states governing the use of up to 11 million in state funding for the heartland corridor rail doublestack clearance project ns began work on the heartland corridor tunnel clearances in october 2007 and the entire project is expected to be completed in 2010 ns expects to spend about 100 million over 2009 and 2010 in connection with this project 

the chicago region environmental and transportation efficiency create project is a publicprivate partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan chicago area ns and other railroads have agreed to participate in create a portion of the public funding has been approved and the parties have developed a list of projects to be included in phase i of the project a total of 100 million in public funding has been secured for phase i and the railroads have contributed an additional 100 million the railroads expect to complete phase i by the end of 2010 as currently planned the total project is estimated to cost 15 billion with city state and federal support if additional public funding is secured the railroads are expected to contribute a total of 232 million towards the entire project ns expects to spend approximately 15 million in 2009 related to create projects

the meridian speedway is a 320 mile rail line between meridian mississippi and shreveport louisiana on may 1 2006 ns and kansas city southern kcs formed a joint venture meridian speedway llc msllc pursuant to which ns would contribute 300 million in cash substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements over a period of approximately three years in exchange for a 30 interest in the joint venture to date ns has contributed 274 million at the formation of msllc kcs contributed the meridian speedway ns is recognizing its pro rata share of the joint venture’s earnings or loss as required under the equity method of accounting ns’ total investment in msllc is supported by the fair value of the rail line as well as intangible assets obtained through the transaction the joint venture is expected to increase capacity and improve service over the meridian speedway into the southeast 

pan am southern llc pas will include the pas lines which consist of a 155mile main line track that runs between mechanicville new york and ayer massachusetts along with 281 miles of secondary and branch lines including trackage rights in new york connecticut massachusetts new hampshire and vermont pas when formed will be a joint venture between ns and pan am railways inc pan am pursuant to which pan am expects to contribute the pas lines and ns expects to contribute cash and other property valued at 140 million a significant portion of which will be used for capital improvements to the pas lines and the related construction of new intermodal and automotive terminals in the albany new york area the joint venture is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 

the crescent corridor is a multistate network of infrastructure improvements and other facilities geared toward creating a seamless highcapacity intermodal route spanning 11 states from new jersey to louisiana and offering truckcompetitive service along several major interstate highway corridors including i81 and i85 as well as i‑20 i40 i59 and i75 based on the public benefits that stand to be derived in the form of highway congestion relief ns plans to implement the crescent corridor through a series of publicprivate partnerships although there is not yet a single integrated plan for the crescent corridor preliminary work has begun and is slated to continue in 2009 including continued infrastructure improvements and other design and engineering work along the virginia portion of the corridor consistent with our matching obligation with respect to funds provided by the commonwealth of virginia  ns expects to spend approximately 30 million related to crescent corridor projects in 2009 

the midamerica corridor is a proposed cooperative arrangement between ns and canadian national railway cn to effectively share track between chicago st louis kentucky and mississippi in order to establish more efficient routes for traffic moving between the midwestern and southeastern us including potential coal traffic moving to nsserved southeastern utility plants from cnserved illinois basin coal producers to implement the midamerica corridor ns at its option would expend funds during the next five years to upgrade the rail line operated by west tennessee railway between fulton kentucky and corinth mississippi a line over which ns would operate pursuant to recently obtained trackage rights the midamerica corridor arrangement is subject to negotiation of definitive agreements between ns and cn regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 

cash used in financing activities was 11 billion in 2008 compared with 16 billion in 2007 and 13 billion in 2006 the decrease in 2008 reflected a net increase in debt compared with a net decline in 2007 which was offset in part by higher dividend payments the increase in 2007 reflected higher share repurchases as a part of ns’ share repurchase program see note 13 as well as higher debt repayments and increased dividend payments 

share repurchases totaled 11 billion in 2008 12 billion in 2007 and 964 million in 2006 for the purchase and retirement of 194 million 236 million and 217 million shares respectively of common stock as part of ns’ share repurchase program in march 2007 ns’ board of directors amended ns’ share repurchase program by increasing the authorized amount of share repurchases from 50 million to 75 million shares and shortening the authorized period from 2015 to 2010 to date almost all of the purchases under the program have been made with internally generated cash however future funding sources could include proceeds from the issuance of debt including the use of the receivable securitization program see note 7 the timing and volume of purchases is guided by management’s assessment of market conditions and other pertinent facts due to economic and market conditions ns reduced its share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the amount of future purchases is uncertain due to the economic climate 

t hrough a private offering ns issued and sold 600 million of unsecured notes in april 2008 see note 7 and subsequently exchanged substantially all of these unregistered securities with essentially identical securities registered under the securities act of 1933 in january 2009 through another private offering ns issued 500 million of unsecured notes at 575 due 2016 see note 7 the net proceeds from the offering were 494 million after deducting the purchase discount and expenses ns has agreed to exchange the unregistered securities with essentially identical securities registered under the securities act of 1933 

subsequent to the january 2009 offering ns has remaining authority from its board of directors to issue and sell up to 500 million of additional debt or equity securities through public or private sale the form s3 shelf registration statements previously filed with the securities and exchange commission sec are no longer effective under sec’s rule 415a5 which provides for a threeyear term ns expects to file a new form s3 registration statement during the first quarter of 2009 

ns has in place and available a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement expiring in 2012 which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes covenants ns had no amounts outstanding under this facility at december 31 2008 and ns is in compliance with all of the covenants ns also has an accounts receivable securitization program which was renewed with a new 364day term ending in october 2009 in addition ns has the ability to directly access the debt markets 

looking forward ns’ annual debt maturities are relatively modest and stable from year to year see note 7 ns expects to refinance maturing debt over the next several years and modestly increase current debt levels overall ns’ goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support ns’ business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require management to make changes to these estimates and assumptions accordingly management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances management regularly discusses the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 10 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans’ assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value management makes these estimates based on the company’s historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance management utilizes an independent consulting actuarial firm’s studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 

ns’ net pension benefit which is included in “compensation and benefits” on its consolidated statements of income was 39 million for the year ended december 31 2008 in recording this amount ns assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 9 which was supported by the longterm total rate of return on plan assets since inception given the uncertain economic outlook and the recent volatility in corporate bond indices management reduced its longterm investment rate of return to 875 for 2009 a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in an 18 million change to the pension credit and as a result an equal change in “compensation and benefits” expense changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns’ net pension benefit or net pension liability in the future the net pension liability is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments in 2008 and 2007 ns utilized an analysis in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans were matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds ns used the results of the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches the payment stream of the benefits in these plans in 2006 ns referred to moody’s seasoned aa corporate bond yields and the changes in such yields in establishing the discount rate 

ns’ net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was 69 million for the year ended december 31 2008 in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits which is included in “other postretirement benefits” management estimated future increases in healthcare costs these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note 10 

properties and depreciation 

most of ns’ total assets are longlived railway properties see note 5 as disclosed in note 1 ns’ properties are depreciated using group depreciation rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by grosston miles other properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value 

ns’ depreciation expense is based on management’s assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement in developing these assumptions ns’ management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an outside firm of consulting engineers these studies analyze ns’ historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices ns’ recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense the studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property ns’ depreciation expense for the year ended december 31 2008 amounted to 804 million ns’ weightedaverage depreciation rates for 2008 are disclosed in note 5 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 28 million increase or decrease to depreciation expense 

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

ns’ expense for casualties and other claims included in “materials and other” amounted to 180 million for the year ended december 31 2008 most of this expense was ns’ accrual related to personal injury liabilities jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded in all cases ns records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable 

to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year ns’ management utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm for employee personal injury cases the actuarial firm studies ns’ historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences an estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims is based on the results of this analysis for occupational injury claims the actuarial firm studies ns’ history of claim filings severity payments and other relevant facts additionally the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting ns’ experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which ns would recognize when such a change became known the most recent actuarial study completed in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in a decrease to ns’ personal injury liability during the fourth quarter while the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower 

ns is subject to various jurisdictions’ environmental laws and regulations it is ns’ policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 17 claims if any against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by ns are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the consolidated balance sheets and are not netted against the associated ns liability environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy 

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately 18 million in 2008 16 million in 2007 and 19 million in 2006 and capital expenditures for environmental matters totaled approximately 7 million in both 2008 and 2007 and 6 million in 2006 capital expenditures for environmental matters in 2009 are expected to be about 9 million 

ns’ consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of 42 million at december 31 2008 and 46 million at december 31 2007 of which 12 million is classified as a current liability at the end of each period at december 31 2008 the liability represented ns’ estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 148 known locations as of that date 13 sites accounted for 22 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period 

at 30 locations one or more ns subsidiaries usually in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statutes which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs 

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns’ ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participant’s share of any estimated loss and that participant’s ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities 

on april 24 2008 the united states department of justice doj brought an action against ns for alleged violations of federal environmental laws resulting from the discharge of chlorine and oil that occurred as a result of the january 6 2005 derailment in graniteville sc including claims for civil penalties as well as injunctive relief on june 24 2008 ns filed a motion to dismiss doj’s claims contending that insufficient facts have been alleged to support such claims ns does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity 

based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances management believes that it is unlikely that any such known facts and circumstances either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity 

norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to expenses while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments in management’s opinion the recorded liability if any is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

income taxes 

ns’ net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 64 billion at december 31 2008 see note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized ns had an 11 million valuation allowance on 991 million of deferred tax assets as of december 31 2008 reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized 

in addition ns has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded for every one half percent change in the 2008 effective tax rate net income would have changed by 14 million 

other matters 

labor agreements 

approximately 26000 or about 85 of ns’ railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act rla ns largely bargains nationally in concert with other major railroads moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose changes 

the most recent national bargaining round began in late 2004 since that time the railroads have reached national agreements that extend through 2009 with all of the rail unions additionally the current agreement with blet extends through 2014 because ns has reached separate agreements with the blet and the american train dispatchers association atda only the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements apply to ns’ locomotive engineers and atdarepresented dispatchers a small number of longshoremen at ashtabula ohio docks are represented by the international longshoremen’s association ila and do not participate in national bargaining negotiations are continuing with that organization 

market risks and hedging activities 

ns has used derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

in 2001 ns began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption the intent of the program was to assist in the management of ns’ aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations which can significantly affect ns’ operating margins and profitability through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments no new hedges have been entered into since may 2004 and the last remaining contracts were settled in the second quarter of 2006 bringing an end to the benefits from the program locomotive diesel fuel costs represented 14 of ns’ operating expenses for 2006 

ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments and by entering into interestrate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio 

at december 31 2008 ns’ debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 317 million a 1 point increase in interest rates would increase ns’ total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately 3 million management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity 

some of ns’ capital leases which carry an average fixed rate of 7 were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements on december 31 2008 the average pay rate under these agreements was 3 and the average receive rate was 7 during 2008 and 2007 the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by approximately 1 million in both periods a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yendenominated obligation most of these deposits are held by foreign banks primarily japanese as a result ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” this statement effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after november 15 2007 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements effective january 1 2008 ns adopted this standard related to financial instrument assets and liabilities with no effect on ns’ consolidated financial statements ns will adopt the provisions of this standard relative to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis in the first quarter of 2009 ns does not expect that it will have an effect on ns’ consolidated financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp emerging issues task force eitf 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” this fsp addresses whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the twoclass method as described in sfas no 128 “earnings per share” ns will adopt the fsp which affects the calculation of earnings per share in the first quarter of 2009 the provisions of the fsp are to be applied retrospectively ns expects that it will not have a material effect on ns’ consolidated financial statements 

fsp no 132r1 “employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets” was issued on december 30 2008 this statement effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2009 clarifies an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan this statement prescribes expanded disclosures regarding investment allocation decisions categories of plan assets inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value the effect of level 3 inputs on changes in plan assets and significant concentrations of risk ns will adopt the fsp at the end of 2009 and expects it will not have a material effect on ns’ consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 sfas 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” which requires that noncontrolling minority interests be reported as a component of equity ns will adopt the statement in the first quarter of 2009 and expects it will not have a material effect on ns’ consolidated financial statements 

inflation

between 1988 and 2000 about 29000 coal cars were rebodied as a result the remaining serviceability of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the high percentage of freight cars built in earlier years 

ongoing freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety reliability customer satisfaction and equipment marketability the locomotive bad order ratio includes units out of service for required inspections every 92 days and program work such as overhauls 

 

encumbrances  certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to approximately 389 million as of dec 31 2007 and 534 million as of dec 31 2006

traffic control  of the approximately 15900 route miles owned by ns about 11000 miles are signalized including 8000 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 3000 miles of automatic block signals of the 8000 miles of ctc approximately 3000 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 258 base station radio sites 

computers  a computer network consisting of a centralized data center in atlanta  georgia  and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards terminals transportation offices rolling stock repair points sales offices and other key system locations operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data in addition the computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and services including payroll car and revenue accounting billing material management activities and controls and special studies 

environmental matters  compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal ns goal to date such compliance has not affected materially ns capital additions earnings liquidity or competitive position see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 “personal injury environmental and legal liabilities” in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees – the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 

 

approximately 85 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

government regulation  in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses ns railroads are subject to regulation by the stb the stb has 

jurisdiction over some rates routes conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers the federal railroad administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards 

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads begun over two decades ago under the staggers rail act of 1980 includes exemptions of intermodal business traileronflatcar containeronflatcar rail boxcar traffic lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing transportation contracts on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the duration of the contract about 87 of ns freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts 

efforts were made in 2007 to resubject the rail industry to unwarranted federal economic regulation and such efforts are expected to continue in 2008 the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially reduced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly ns will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation 

competition  there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprocess users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

ns primary rail competitor is the csx system both operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory ns also competes with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage 

certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets 

security of operations  ns has taken significant steps to provide enhanced security for the ns rail system in particular ns has developed and implemented a comprehensive security plan that is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the association of american railroads aar post september 11 2001 the aar security plan defines four alert levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry as the terrorist threat increases or decreases the alert level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas 1 operations including transportation engineering and mechanical 2 information technology and communications and 3 railroad police although security concerns preclude public disclosure of its contents the ns departmental security plan outlines the protocol within ns for all concerned to be notified of aar alert level changes  all ns operations division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers as appropriate of any change in alert level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change 

the ns plan also effectively addresses and complies with department of transportation security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials among more focused elements of the plan security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety and this training is integrated into recurring hazardous material training and recertification programs toward that end ns wor ki ng closely with the national transit institute at rutgers university  developed a fourmodule uniform national training program more indepth security training has been given to those select ns employees who have been given specific security responsibilities and additional 

locationspecific security plans have been developed for certain metropolitan areas and each of six port facilities served by ns with respect to the ports each facility plan has been approved by the applicable captain of the port and subject to inspection by the us coast guard 

additionally ns engages in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies including the us department of homeland security dhs the transportation security administration tsa the federal bureau of investigation fbi the federal railroad administration fra the us coast guard us customs and border protection and various state homeland security offices as one notable example an ns police special agent under the auspices of the aar has been assigned to the national joint terrorism task force njttf operating out of fbi headquarters in washington  dc to represent and serve as liaison to the north american rail industry this arrangement improves logistical flow of vital security and law enforcement information with respect to the rail industry as a whole while having the post filled by an ns special agent has served to foster a strong wor ki ng relationship between ns and the fbi ns also has become a member of the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat program sponsored by us customs ctpat allows ns to work closely with us customs and its customers to develop measures that will help ensure the integrity of freight shipments moving on ns particularly those moving to or from a foreign country based on participation in ctpat ns has ensured that its plan meets all current applicable security recommendations made by us customs 

similarly ns is guided in its operations by various supplemental security action items issued by dhs and us department of transportation dot us coast guard maritime security requirements as well as voluntary security action items developed in collaboration with tsa dot and the freight railroads in 2006 many of the action items are based on lessons learned from dhs and dot security assessments of rail corridors in high threat urban areas htua begun in 2004 particular attention is paid to 1 the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxicbyinhalation tih materials 2 the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying tih materials 3 the minimization of unattended loaded tank cars carrying tih materials and 4 cooperation with federal state local and tribal governments to identify through risk assessments those locations where security risks are the highest these action items and ns’ compliance initiatives are outlined in the various departmental sections of the ns departmental security plan 

in 2007 through participation in the transportation community awareness and emergency response transcaer program ns provided rail accident response training to approximately 5000 emergency responders such as local police and fire personnel representing over 22000 manhours of emergency response training ns’ other training efforts throughout 2007 included participation in a major security drill with amtrak and the state of delaware in new castle county  as well as coordinating tabletop exercises involving the “staged” release of tih shipments with various local state and federal agencies ns also has ongoing programs to sponsor local emergency responders at tank car emergency response training programs conducted at the aar transportation technology center in pueblo  colorado  and its annual transcaer whistlestop train makes stops in numerous cities its special training cars serving as a resource to an audience of nearly 1000 emergency responders annually 

improvements in equipment design also are expected to play a role in enhancing rail security the aar has developed new tank car specifications for chlorine and anhydrous ammonia which are scheduled to become effective on march 31 2008 in the near future the fra is also expected to issue a proposed regulation addressing the redesign of pressurized tank cars used for the transportation of tih gases and liquids a consortium of chemical companies is also studying improvements in tank car head shell fittings and thermal protection in order to improve the survivability of current tank cars

railroads are subject to commercial regulation by the stb which has jurisdiction over some routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers in addition congress could enact reregulation legislation economic reregulation of the rail industry by congress could have a significant negative impact on ns’ ability to determine prices for rail services reduce capital spending on its rail network and result in a material adverse effect in the future on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

railroads are subject to safety and security regulation by the dot and the dhs which regulate most aspects of ns’ operations proposed amendments to federal rail safety statutes if enacted could add significantly to operating costs and increase the number of employees ns and other railroads employ in addition ns’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on ns 

ns’ operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to water ways or ground water supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions past present and future – is inherent in the railroad business several of ns’ subsidiaries own or have owned land used as operating property or held for sale or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and ns could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns as a common carrier by rail must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property damage costs and compromise critical parts of our rail network legislation introduced in congress would give federal regulators increased authority to conduct investigations and levy substantial fines and penalties in connection with railroad accidents under provisions enacted in august 2007 federal regulators are required to prescribe new regulations governing railroads’ transportation of hazardous materials including annual routing analyses security risk assessments and employee security training regulations proposed in late 2006 by dhs mandating chain of custody and security measures likely will cause service degradation and higher costs for the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials further certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders some legislators have contemplated prenotification requirements for hazardous materials shipments if promulgated such ordinances could require the rerouting of hazardous materials shipments with the potential for significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

ns may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect ns’ results of operations financial position and liquidity in a particular year or quarter because ns plays a critical role in the nation’s transportation system it could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

although ns currently maintains insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism it maintains only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in ns’ care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of ns’ current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses may not be available to ns in the future 

ns may be affected by general economic conditions prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities ns carries may have an adverse effect on its operating results financial position and liquidity economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns faces competition from other transportation providers ns is subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and the quality and reliability of service while ns has used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain its rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which ns operates or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the operations of carriers with which ns interchanges may adversely affect its operations ns’ ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon its ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue divisions car supply and locomotive availability data exchange and communications reciprocal switching interchange and trackage rights deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in ns’ inability to meet its customers’ demands or require ns to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

ns relies on technology and technology improvements in its business operations if ns experiences significant disruption or failure of one or more of its information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment ns could experience a service interruption security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations financial condition and liquidity in a particular year or quarter additionally if ns does not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if it is unable to implement new technology ns may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the vast majority of ns employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect its operations a pproximately 26000 or about 85 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown ns could experience a significant disruption of its operations additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase ns’ costs for healthcare wages and other benefits any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of ns’ business exposes it to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury commercial disputes freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated 

personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employers’ liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded 

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss or property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on ns’ operating results financial condition and liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance ns has obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages specified levels of risk are retained on a selfinsurance basis currently up to 25 million and above 1 billion per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and 25 million and above 175 million per occurrence for property owned by ns or in its care custody or control insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to ns 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes and floods may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect ns’ operational efficiency and ability to meet demand workforce demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on ns’ ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on ns’ operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of its supplier markets ns consumes about 500 million gallons of diesel fuel each year fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations if a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or otherwise ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter could be adversely affected also such an event would impact ns as well as its customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capital intensive nature and industryspecific requirements of the rail industry there are high barriers of entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally ns competes with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials such as rail and ties changes in the competitive landscapes of these limitedsupplier markets could result in increased prices or material shortages that could materially affect ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

overview 

ns’ 2007 results reflected softness in the overall economy that resulted in reduced traffic volumes despite this railway operating revenues increased slightly as improved average revenue per unit offset the volume declines railway operating expenses were about even resulting in a railway operating ratio a measure of the amount of revenues consumed by operating expenses of 726 which improved modestly from 2006 

cash provided by operating activities exceeded 2 billion for the third consecutive year and along with a reduction in cash and shortterm investment balances provided funding for increased capital expenditures significant share repurchases and higher dividends 

loo ki ng ahead ns expects revenues to continue to grow reflecting higher average revenue per unit and modestly higher traffic volume particularly later in 2008 provided the overall economy improves ns plans to continue to improve service and maintain a marketbased approach to pricing 

during 2007 ns purchased and retired 236 million shares of ns common stock at a total cost of 12 billion under the share repurchase program approved by the board of directors on nov 22 2005 the board of directors amended the program in march 2007 and authorized the repurchase of up to 75 million shares of ns common stock through dec 31 2010 in total ns has purchased and retired 453 million shares under this program at a total cost of 22 billion 

summarized results of operations 

2007 compared with 2006 

net income in 2007 was 15 billion down 17 million or 1 compared with 2006 diluted earnings per share were 368 up 011 or 3 reflecting fewer shares outstanding as a result of ns’ share repurchase program see note 13 the decrease in net income was primarily due to higher income taxes and lower non‑operating items that offset higher income from railway operations railway operating revenues increased 25 million as higher average revenue per unit overshadowed lower traffic volumes railway operating expenses decreased 3 million principally due to lower volumerelated expenses that offset higher fuel expense 

2006 compared with 2005 

net income in 2006 was 15 billion or 357 per diluted share up 200 million or 16 compared with 13 billion or 311 per diluted share in 2005 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations offset in part by the absence of the 96 million income tax benefit recorded in 2005 because of ohio tax law changes see note 3 railway operating revenues increased 880 million reflecting higher rates including fuel surcharges that accounted for about 40 of the increase and modestly higher traffic volume railway operating expenses rose 440 million or 7 principally due to higher fuel prices and increased compensation and benefit costs 

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

railway operating revenues were 94 billion in 2007 and 2006 and 85 billion in 2005 the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volume and average revenue per unit by market group 

 

revenues increased 25 million in 2007 and 880 million in 2006 automotive revenue in 2007 included 26 million related to a contract volume settlement as shown in the following table the increase in 2007 was due to higher average revenue per unit that more than offset decreased traffic volumes whereas the improvement in 2006 was the result of increased average revenue per unit and higher traffic volumes 

 

both comparisons reflect large increases in average revenue per unit a result of higher rates in 2006 about 40 of the revenue increase was attributable to higher fuel surcharges traffic volume decreased in 2007 reflecting declines in all commodity groups except agricultureconsumer productsgovernment and chemicals in 2006 traffic volume rose 1 principally due to higher intermodal and metalsconstruction shipments 

on january 26 2007 the surface transportation board stb issued a decision that the type of fuel surcharge imposed by ns and most other large railroads – a fuel surcharge based on a percentage of line haul revenue – would no longer be permitted for regulated traffic that moves under public tariff rates the stb gave the railroads a 90‑day transition period to adjust their fuel surcharge programs during the second quarter ns discontinued assessing fuel surcharges on its published nonintermodal public rates future adjustments to public prices will reflect ongoing market conditions ns does not expect that compliance with the new stb regulations will have a material effect on its financial condition results of operations or liquidity the traffic moving under these tariffs and public quotes comprised less than 10 of norfolk southern’s total revenue base 

coal revenues decreased 15 million or 1 compared with 2006 as a 2 reduction in tonnage handled more than offset a 3 increase in average revenue per unit carloads declined 3 a higher percentage than the change in tonnage handled because of increased average tonnage per car coal represented 25 of ns’ revenues in 2007 and 78 of shipments handled originated on ns’ lines as shown in the following table decreased shipments of utility and domestic metallurgical coal more than offset higher export and industrial shipments 

 

coal revenues in 2006 increased 215 million or 10 compared with 2005 which reflected higher average revenue per unit and slightly higher traffic volume coal average revenue per unit was up 9 compared with 2005 reflecting increased fuel surcharges and higher rates tempered by the absence of a 55 million benefit from coal rate settlements in the second quarter of 2005 coal represented 25 of ns’ revenues in 2006 and 79 of shipments handled originated on ns’ lines traffic volumes rose 1 primarily because of increased shipments of utility and domestic metallurgical coal that offset lower export and iron ore shipments 

ns is currently involved in litigation with virginia electric and power companyold dominion electric cooperative virginia power regarding rate adjustment provisions in a transportation contract between them during the second quarter of 2007 the virginia supreme court issued a decision that remanded the case to the trial court on the grounds that neither of its prior decisions constituted a final order future developments and the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in ns recognizing additional revenues related to this dispute which could have a favorable impact on results of operations in a particular year or quarter 

utility coal tonnage decreased 4 compared with 2006 reflecting high stockpile levels particularly in the southeast that led to reduced shipments despite fairly strong electric generation up 4 in the ns service region in addition the temporary closure of a major coal mine as well as the loss of business to barge transportation contributed to the decline 

in 2006 utility coal tonnage increased 4 compared with 2005 reflecting the rebuilding of stockpiles by customers more shipments from the powder river basin in the west and higher shipments of import coal through charleston  sc 

a number of evolving environmental issues could affect the utility coal market these include potential regional programs aimed at capping and reducing power plant co 2 emissions and ongoing efforts at addressing climate change in response to changes in environmental regulations certain utilities have begun adding or are planning to add emissions control technologies to their electric generating units allowing them to utilize their existing coalfired power plants 

in 2008 demand for utility coal is expected to be mixed with declining utility inventories in the northeast stimulating growth but above normal stockpiles in the southeast mitigating the growth 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage decreased 14 in 2007 compared with 2006 the decrease was primarily due to coke furnace outages mine production outages and reduced spot iron ore traffic 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage increased 4 in 2006 compared with 2005 the increase was driven by higher domestic metallurgical coal and coke shipments in the first half of the year in response to steelma ki ng demand which more than offset a decline in iron ore volume caused by the shutdown of a blast furnace at a major customer location 

in 2008 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore demand is expected to be comparable to 2007 for the first half of the year however demand is expected to increase in the second half due to plant expansions 

export coal tonnage in 2007 increased 25 compared to 2006 primarily due to increased demand reflecting a lower valued dollar as well as loading delays at australian ports norfolk volume increased by approximately 26000 cars or 25 and baltimore volume was up approximately 4500 cars or 19 

in 2006 export coal tonnage decreased 15 compared to 2005 reflecting weaker demand for us coal as europe and asia continued to increase purchases from other countries baltimore volume was down approximately 13500 cars or 37 and norfolk volume declined by approximately 3000 cars or 3 

in 2008 export coal tonnage is expected to increase reflecting increased global demand 

other coal tonnage principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants increased 6 versus 2006 primarily due to new business and stronger demand in 2006 other coal tonnage decreased 3 versus 2005 primarily due to plant closures and mine production problems 

general merchandise revenues increased 90 million or 2 in 2007 compared with 2006 as a 6 increase in average revenue per unit reflecting continued marketbased pricing in all groups more than offset a 4 decline in traffic volume revenue in 2007 included 26 million related to a volumerelated contract settlement with an automotive customer 

in 2006 general merchandise revenues increased 520 million or 11 compared with 2005 as all market groups posted higher average revenue per unit driven by increased rates and fuel surcharges traffic volume declined slightly as improved metals and construction and agriculture volumes were offset by declines in the other business groups 

chemicals revenue increased 8 compared with 2006 reflecting higher rates in all groups traffic volume rose modestly as more shipments of industrial intermediates offset fewer shipments in the petroleum miscellaneous chemicals and plastics markets which continued to reflect weakness in housingrelated demand 

in 2006 chemicals revenues increased 10 despite a 4 drop in traffic volume reflecting increased rates and fuel surcharges petroleum industrial and plastics traffic volumes were down as a result of lower inventories arising from postkatrina conditions the closure of several plants on ns lines and the weaker housing and automotive markets 

in 2008 chemicals revenue is expected to improve principally due to increased average revenue per unit as volumes are expected to be comparable to 2007 

metals and construction revenue decreased 2 in 2007 as a 5 increase in average revenue per unit that resulted from higher rates was more than offset by the effects of a 6 decrease in traffic volume the decline in volume was principally due to lower iron steel and coil shipments and reduced demand for construction materials both reflecting the soft automotive and housing sectors 

in 2006 metals and construction revenue increased 19 and traffic volume increased 5 compared with 2005 as declines in the fourth quarter were offset by higher volumes through the rest of the year revenue per unit rose 

14 because of increased rates and fuel surcharges the increase in traffic volume was driven primarily by higher import slab business to nsserved steel mills more scrap metal shipments and higher sand gravel and cement traffic for commercial and highway construction projects 

in 2008 metals and construction revenues are expected to grow as a result of higher traffic volumes principally due to new business and improved average revenue per unit however growth could be somewhat dampened by the continued softness of the automotive and housing markets 

agriculture consumer products and government revenue increased 5 in 2007 compared with 2006 the revenue improvement resulted from higher average revenue per unit which reflected higher rates traffic volume rose modestly as more corn fertilizer and ethanol shipments were mitigated by less government and consumer product volume 

in 2006 agriculture consumer products and government revenue increased 19 and traffic volume increased 4 compared with 2005 average revenue per unit rose 15 a result of higher rates and fuel surcharges traffic volume growth resulted from increased ethanol military and corn shipments military traffic growth was primarily due to the continued support of military operations in iraq  

agriculture revenue is expected to continue to grow in 2008 benefiting from increasing demand for biofuel products including corn soybeans and ethanol as well as higher rates however lower volumes in consumer products are expected to partially offset this growth 

automotive revenues were flat in 2007 compared with 2006 as lower traffic volumes offset higher average revenue per unit revenue in 2007 included a 26 million volumerelated contract settlement volume decreased 5 reflecting softness in demand for vehicles as well as parts and the closure in june 2007 of an nsserved plant 

in 2006 automotive revenues declined 2 compared with 2005 as lower volumes offset increased average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges volume decreased 9 primarily due to substantial production cuts at ford general motors and daimlerchrysler assembly plants including two nsserved plant closures at ford and one at general motors during 2006 reduced production at honda and bmw also contributed to the volume decrease 

for 2008 automotive revenues are expected to be lower reflecting continued production cutbacks and weak demand 

paper clay and forest products revenue decreased 3 in 2007 compared with 2006 as the effects of higher average revenue per unit were more than offset by an 8 decrease in traffic volume reflecting the continued housing slowdown and decline in conventional paper markets 

in 2006 paper clay and forest products revenue increased 11 compared with 2005 due to higher average revenue per unit including fuel surcharges despite a 1 decrease in traffic volume higher solid waste and debris traffic and growth in traffic from the import of printing paper partially offset reduced pulp and pulp board shipments 

in 2008 paper clay and forest products revenues are expected to be about even as growth in waste and debris transportation and higher revenue per unit are expected to be tempered by continued weakness in housingrelated markets 

intermodal revenues decreased 50 million or 3 compared with 2006 as a 4 reduction in traffic volumes offset a 2 increase in average revenue per unit truckload volume decreased 10 compared with 

2006 and domestic intermodal marketing companies imc volume declined 4 traffic volume for triple crown services company triple crown a service with railtohighway trailers dropped 3 the declines for truckload imc and triple crown were primarily due to lower national demand for dry van shipments resulting from continued weakness in the housing and automotive markets and increased overtheroad competition international traffic volume decreased 4 reflecting reduced shipments of empty containers and less inland rail transportation of west coast port traffic which offset volume growth from east coast port traffic premium business which includes parcel and ltl lessthantruckload carriers was up 2 reflecting gains in parcel shipments that offset modest declines in ltl shipper traffic 

in 2006 intermodal revenues increased 145 million or 8 compared with 2005 largely because of higher fuel surcharges increased rates and improved traffic volume traffic volume for the year rose 3 notwithstanding a 3 decline in the fourth quarter truckload volume increased 8 reflecting continued expansion of business with traditional truckload companies imc volume declined 9 a result of declines in the housing construction and automotive markets triple crown services company had flat volume compared with 2005 as higher consumer product shipments were offset by weaker automotiverelated shipments international traffic volume rose 9 reflecting growth in imported goods from asia and exported goods through nsserved east coast ports as well as west coast ports premium business was down 3 as lower ltl shipper traffic offset modest gains in parcel shipments intermodal revenue per unit increased 4 principally a result of higher fuel surcharges as well as increased rates and longerhaul international traffic which was offset in part by the ongoing shift of shipments from higher revenue per unit railprovided assets trailers and containers to lower revenue per unit shipments in shipperprovided equipment 

for 2008 intermodal revenue is expected to show improvement bolstered by higher average revenue per unit and modest improvement in volumes 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses in 2007 were 68 billion about even with expenses in 2006 which were up 440 million compared to 2005 the 2007 comparison reflected volumerelated decreases offset by higher fuel expense the increase in 2006 was due to higher fuel prices and increased compensation and benefits 

the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses improved to 726 in 2007 compared with 728 in 2006 and 752 in 2005 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

 

compensation and benefits  which represents 37 of total railway operating expenses decreased 85 million or 3 compared with 2006 primarily due to lower incentive compensation down 48 million lower volumerelated payroll down 37 million the absence of the prior year retirement and waiver agreements with former executives as well as the cost of the regular stockbased grant to the former chief executive officer 24 million lower stockbased compensation down 13 million and lower payroll taxes down 12 million that were partially offset by increased wage rates up 27 million and higher medical costs up 27 million 

in 2006 compensation and benefits increased 144 million or 6 compared with 2005 expenses in 2006 included the effect of the implementation of statement of accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” which increased stockbased compensation expense by 27 million most of the increase was reflected in the first quarter which included the effect of accelerated recognition of costs related to grants to retirementeligible employees the remaining increase was attributable to increased salaries and wages up 44 million higher health and welfare benefit costs up 29 million retirement and waiver agreements entered into in the first quarter as well as the cost of the regular stockbased grant to the former chief executive officer who retired up 24 million and higher payroll taxes up 17 million 

ns employment averaged 30806 in 2007 compared with 30541 in 2006 and 30294 in 2005 the increased number of employees was almost exclusively in operating department personnel to meet service needs as well as to prepare for expected retirements ns continues to hire and train additional workers in order to meet the requirements of forecasted volumes in light of the demographics of its work force 

purchased services and rents includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses decreased 27 million or 2 in 2007 compared to 2006 but increased 31 million or 2 in 2006 compared to 2005 the decline in 2007 was principally due to lower equipment rents while the 2006 increase reflected increased maintenance activities 

purchased services costs were 1172 million in 2007 1165 million in 2006 and 1142 million in 2005 in 2007 higher expenses for maintenance activities were largely offset by volumerelated declines the increase in 2006 reflected higher intermodal volumerelated expenses 

equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment amounted to 379 million 413 million and 405 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the decrease in 2007 was principally due to lower shipment volumes the increase in 2006 was primarily due to a reduction in rents received on automotive equipment as a result of decreased shipments 

fuel expense which includes the cost of locomotive fuel as well as other fuel used in railway operations increased 74 million or 7 in 2007 compared with 2006 and increased 274 million or 33 in 2006 compared with 2005 fuel expense is recorded net of hedge benefits although there have been no such benefits since may 2006 when the program wound down see “market risks and hedging activities” below and note 16 the increase in 2007 reflected a 9 increase in the price per gallon of locomotive fuel as well as the absence of hedge benefits offset in part by a 4 decline in consumption expense in 2006 included hedge benefits of 20 million compared with benefits of 148 million in 2005 and reflected a 13 rise in the average price per gallon with a 1 increase in consumption 

legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2005 repealed the 43 cents per gallon excise tax on railroad diesel fuel for 2007 with the following phased reductions in 2005 and 2006 1 cent per gallon from jan 1 2005 through june 30 2005 2 cents per gallon from july 1 2005 through dec 31 2006 and by the full 43 cents thereafter ns consumes about 500 million gallons of locomotive diesel fuel per year 

depreciation expense increased 37 million or 5 in 2007 compared to 2006 but decreased 36 million or 5 in 2006 compared with 2005 in both years substantial capital investments and improvements resulted in higher depreciation expense the net decrease in 2006 reflected the results of an equipment depreciation study and an analysis of the assets received in the conrail corporation reorganization completed in 2006 

materials and other expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters decreased 2 million in 2007 compared with 2006 but increased 27 million or 3 in 2006 compared to 2005 as shown in the following table 

 

the decline in 2007 was primarily due to lower derailment and personal injury costs offset in part by higher property and other taxes and increased materials costs for maintenance activities 

the increase in 2006 reflected increased locomotive and freight car repair costs due to more maintenance activity related to higher usage from increased traffic volumes coupled with the age of the fleet as well as higher expenses arising from derailments and insurance costs these increases were partially offset by the absence of 38 million of costs associated with the 2005 derailment in graniteville  south carolina  and an unfavorable jury verdict in an employee injury case 

in 2005 ns recorded a liability related to the jan 6 2005 derailment in graniteville  sc the liability which includes a current and longterm portion represents ns’ best estimate based on current facts and circumstances the estimate includes amounts related to business property damage and other economic losses personal injury and individual property damage claims as well as thirdparty response costs ns’ commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment above ns’ selfinsured retention including ns’ response costs and legal fees accordingly the consolidated balance sheets reflect a current and longterm receivable for estimated recoveries from ns’ insurance carriers while it is reasonable to expect that the liability for covered losses could differ from the amount recorded such a change would be offset by a corresponding change in the insurance receivable as a result ns does not believe that it is reasonably likely that its net loss the difference between the liability and future recoveries will be materially different than the loss previously recorded ns expects at this time that insurance coverage is adequate to cover potential claims and settlements above its selfinsurance retention 

the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 60 of total employee injury cases resolved and about 40 of total payments made with its longestablished commitment to safety ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs with respect to occupational injuries which are not caused by a specific accident or event but result from a claimed exposure over time the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades 

the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased system which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers compensation system 

ns maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims it also retains reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance see note 17 ns expects insurance costs to be slightly higher in 2008 

other income – net 

other income – net was 93 million in 2007 149 million in 2006 and 74 million in 2005 see note 2 the decrease in 2007 reflected lower interest income 31 million higher expenses associated with synthetic fuelrelated tax credit investments 15 million and lower returns from corporateowned life insurance 15 million that combined to offset higher equity in earnings of conrail 20 million 

ns has membership interests representing ownership in companies that owned and operated facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal in addition ns purchased two facilities that produced synthetic fuel from coal in 2007 the production of synthetic fuel resulted in tax credits as well as expenses related to the investments the expenses are recorded as a component of “other income – net” and the tax credits as well as tax benefits related to the expenses are reflected in “provision for income taxes” see discussion below 

results in 2006 reflected lower expense associated with tax credit investments primarily due to synthetic fuel related investments greater interest income and higher returns from corporateowned life insurance that were partially offset by lower equity in conrail earnings 

income taxes 

income tax expense in 2007 was 773 million for an effective rate of 35 compared with effective rates of 34 in 2006 and 25 in 2005 the increase in the rate for 2007 largely resulted from illinois tax legislation which increased deferred taxes by 19 million see note 3 the increase in the rate for 2006 was primarily due to the absence of an ohio tax law change that lowered the effective rate in 2005 as well as fewer tax credits from synthetic fuelrelated investments synthetic fuel tax credits were available through the end of 2007 

synthetic fuel credits are subject to reduction if the reference price of a barrel of oil for the year falls within an inflationadjusted phaseout range specified by the tax code the reference price for a year is the annual average wellhead price per barrel of unregulated domestic crude oil as determined by the secretary of the treasury by april 1 of the following year in 2006 the phaseout range was 5506 to 6912 and the phaseout range is adjusted annually for inflation while ns cannot predict with certainty the reference price for the year ns estimated a 66  phaseout of synthetic fuel credits in 2007 based on actual oil prices during the year 

net income in 2007 reflects 5 million less in net benefits from these credits as compared with the same period of 2006 as shown below 

 

the tax credits generated by ns’ synthetic fuel related investments which reduced the effective tax rate by 3 in 2007 and 2006 and 6 in 2005 expired at the end of 2007 and accordingly the effective tax rate is expected to increase in 2008 see note 3 

ns’ consolidated federal income tax returns for 2004 and 2005 are being audited by the internal revenue service irs the irs completed its examination of the 2002 and 2003 consolidated federal income tax returns during the third quarter of 2006 and ns has appealed certain adjustments proposed by the irs the results of the examination had a negligible effect on the effective tax rate 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities ns principal source of liquidity was 23 billion in 2007 compared with 22 billion in 2006 and 21 billion in 2005 the improvement in 2007 resulted from favorable changes in wor ki ng capital as well as the modest improvement in income from railway operations in 2006 higher income from railway operations was partially offset by higher income tax payments ns had a wor ki ng capital deficit of 273 million at dec 31 2007 compared with wor ki ng capital of 307 million at dec 31 2006 the change was largely the result of reduced cash and shortterm investments that were used to repurchase stock ns expects that cash on hand combined with cash flow provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations ns’ cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances totaled 206 million and 918 million at dec 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

contractual obligations at dec 31 2007 comprised of ns longterm debt including capital leases see note 7 operating leases see note 8 agreements with crc see note 4 unconditional purchase obligations see note 17 longterm advances from conrail see note 4 and unrecognized tax benefits see note 3 were as follows 

 

 when the amount and timing of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits can be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the table under the appropriate period when the year of settlement cannot be reasonably estimated the amount is shown in the other column 

off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 8 

cash used for investing activities was 1 billion in 2007 compared with 684 million in 2006 and 18 billion in 2005 the increase in 2007 primarily reflected lower net proceeds from shortterm investment sales and purchases and increased property additions the decrease in 2006 reflected higher proceeds from shortterm investment sales principally to fund share repurchases reflected in financing activities offset in part by the 100 million investment in meridian speedway llc msllc see discussion below and increased property additions 

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 

 

 

 

for 2008 ns has budgeted 143 billion for capital expenditures the anticipated spending includes 613 million for rail crosstie ballast and bridge programs and 339 million is provided for infrastructure and expansion investments including increased mainline capacity track upgrades and expansions to accommodate new customers or traffic and large network publicprivate partnership investments such as the heartland corridor and chicago create programs see discussion below norfolk southern expects to spend approximately 143 million on intermodal terminals and equipment to add capacity to the intermodal network increased access and capacity for coal and merchandise traffic and bulk transfer facilities planned equipment spending of 264 million provides 119 million for locomotives including the purchase of 15 new units and continued spending on improvements to the locomotive fleet approximately 145 million will be spent on freight cars including the acquisition of 1330 new higher capacity coal cars as part of a multiyear program to replace the existing coal car fleet the purchase of 321 freight cars upon their lease expiration 163 multilevel automobile racks and improvements to multilevel racks norfolk southern also expects to spend 66 million related to computers systems and information technology ns expects to make all of its capital expenditures with internally generated funds 

the meridian speedway is a 320 mile rail line between meridian  mississippi and shreveport  louisiana  on may 1 2006 ns and kansas city southern kcs formed a joint venture msllc pursuant to which ns expects to contribute 300 million in cash substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements over a period of approximately three years in exchange for a 30 interest in the joint venture to date ns has contributed 240 million at the formation of msllc kcs contributed the meridian speedway ns is recognizing its pro rata share of the joint venture’s earnings or loss as required under the equity method of accounting ns’ total investment in msllc is supported by the fair value of the rail line as well as intangible assets obtained through the transaction the joint venture is expected to increase capacity and improve service over the meridian speedway into the southeast 

the heartland corridor is a package of proposed clearance improvements and other facilities that will create a seamless highcapacity intermodal route across virginia and west virginia to midwest markets during 2006 with respect to the tunnel clearance component of the heartland corridor ns and the states of ohio  west virginia and virginia each entered into a memorandum of agreement with the federal highway administration that governs the release of up to 95 million in authorized federal funding in 2006 ns also entered into agreements with two states governing the use of up to 11 million in state funding for the heartland corridor rail doublestack clearance project ns expects to spend about 60 million in connection with this project ns began work on the heartland corridor tunnel clearances in october 2007 and the entire project is expected to be completed by 2010 

the chicago region environmental and transportation efficiency create project is a publicprivate partnership to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan chicago area ns and other railroads have agreed to participate in create a portion of the public funding has been approved and the parties have developed a list of projects to be included in phase i of the project a total of 100 million in public funding has been secured for phase i and the railroads have contributed an additional 100 million the railroads expect to complete phase i over the next three years as currently planned the total project is estimated to cost 15 billion with city state and federal support if additional public funding is secured the railroads are expected to contribute a total of 232 million towards the entire project with ns’ share slated to be 34 million

cash used for financing activities was 16 billion in 2007 compared with 13 billion in 2006 and 456 million in 2005 the increases reflected higher share repurchases as a part of ns’ ongoing share repurchase program see note 13 as well as higher debt repayments and increased dividend payments financing activities in 2007 include 250 million of proceeds from ns’ receivable securitization facility see note 7 

share repurchases totaled 12 billion in 2007 and 964 million in 2006 for the purchase and retirement of 236 million shares and 217 million shares respectively of common stock as part of ns’ ongoing share repurchase program in march 2007 ns’ board of directors amended ns’ share repurchase program by increasing the authorized amount of share repurchases from 50 million to 75 million shares and shortening the authorized period from 2015 to 2010 the timing and volume of purchases is guided by management’s assessment of market conditions and other pertinent facts to date almost all of the purchases under the program have been made with internally generated cash however future funding sources are expected to include proceeds from the issuance of debt including the use of the receivable securitization program see note 7 dependent on economic and market conditions ns expects to purchase and retire a similar amount of shares in 2008 

ns has in place and available a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement expiring in 2012 which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at dec 31 2007 and ns is in compliance with all of the financial covenants ns also has in place two shelf registration statements on form s3 filed with the sec in march 2001 and september 2004 under which up to 700 million of additional debt or equity securities could be issued see note 7 

loo ki ng forward ns expects to refinance maturing debt over the next several years and modestly increase current debt levels overall ns’ goal is to maintain a capital structure with appropriate leverage to support ns’ business strategy and provide flexibility through business cycles 

application of critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require management to change them accordingly management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances management regularly discusses the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors there have been no significant changes to the application of critical accounting estimates disclosure contained in ns’ form 10‑k as of dec 31 2007 with the exception of the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” which is discussed below in “new accounting pronouncements” and in note 3 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 10 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance management utilizes an independent consulting actuarial firm’s studies to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 

ns net pension benefit which is included in “compensation and benefits” on its consolidated statements of income was 40 million for the year ended dec 31 2007 in recording this amount ns assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 9 investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10 15 and 20year periods has been a rate of return in excess of 10 and supports the current rate of return assumption a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 19 million change to the pension credit and as a result an equal change in “compensation and benefits” expense changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future the net pension asset is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments in 2007 ns utilized an analysis in which the projected annual cash flows from the pension and postretirement benefit plans were matched with a yield curve based on an appropriate universe of highquality corporate bonds ns used the results of the yield curve to select the discount rate that matches the payment stream of the benefits in these plans previously ns referred to moody’s seasoned aa corporate bond yields and the changes in such yields in establishing the discount rate 

ns net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was 76 million for the year ended dec 31 2007 in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits which is included in “other postretirement benefits” as disclosed in note 10 

management estimated future increases in healthcare costs these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note 10 

properties and depreciation 

most of ns total assets are comprised of longlived railway properties see note 5 as disclosed in note 1 ns properties are depreciated using group depreciation rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by grosston miles other properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value 

ns depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement in developing these assumptions ns’ management utilizes periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an outside firm of consulting engineers these studies analyze ns historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices ns recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense the studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property ns depreciation expense for the year ended dec 31 2007 amounted to 775 million ns weightedaverage depreciation rates for 2007 are disclosed in note 5 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 27 million increase or decrease to ns depreciation expense 

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

ns expense for casualties and other claims included in “materials and other” amounted to 171 million for the year ended dec 31 2007 most of this expense was composed of ns accrual related to personal injury liabilities jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded in all cases ns records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable 

to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year ns’ management utilizes studies prepared by an independent consulting actuarial firm for employee personal injury cases the actuarial firm studies ns historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements ta ki ng into account relevant outside influences an estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims is based on the results of this analysis for occupational injury claims the actuarial firm studies ns’ history of claim filings severity payments and other relevant facts additionally the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting ns’ experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which ns would recognize when such a change became known the most recent actuarial study completed in the fourth quarter of 2007 resulted in a decrease to ns personal injury liability during the fourth quarter while the liability recorded is support ed by the most recent study it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liability could be higher or lower 

ns is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations it is ns policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 17 claims if any against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by ns are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the consolidated balance sheets and are not netted against the associated ns liability environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy 

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately 16 million in 2007 19 million in 2006 and 16 million in 2005 and capital expenditures totaled approximately 7 million in 2007 6 million in 2006 and 9 million in 2005 capital expenditures in 2008 are expected to be comparable to those in 2007 

ns consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of 46 million at dec 31 2007 and 54 million at dec 31 2006 of which 12 million was accounted for as a current liability at dec 31 2007 and 2006 at dec 31 2007 the liability represented ns estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 155 identified locations on that date 13 sites accounted for 25 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period 

at 32 locations one or more ns subsidiaries usually in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statutes which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs 

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss and that participants ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities 

based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to expenses while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments in managements opinion the recorded liability if any is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

income taxes 

ns net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 64 billion at dec 31 2007 see note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns  for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized ns had a 10 million valuation allowance on 685 million of deferred tax assets as of dec 31 2007 reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized 

in addition ns has a recorded liability for its estimate of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return judgment is required in evaluating the application of federal and state tax laws and assessing whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained on examination and if so judgment is also required as to the measurement of the amount of tax benefit that will realized upon settlement with the taxing authority management believes this liability for uncertain tax positions to be adequate income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which new information about a tax position becomes available or the final outcome differs from the amounts recorded for every one half percent change in the 2007 effective rate net income would have changed by 11 million 

other matters 

labor agreements 

approximately 26000 or about 85 of ns railroad employees are covered by labor agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act rla ns largely bargains in concert with other major railroads moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose changes the most recent bargaining round began in late 2004 since that time the railroads have finalized agreements that extend through 2009 with all of the major rail unions except the united transportation union utu and the international association of machinists iam a tentative agreement has been reached with the utu that is subject to ratification by employees 

ns previously reached separate agreements with the brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen blet and the american train dispatchers association atda through 2009 thus only the health and welfare provisions from the national agreements will apply to ns’ locomotive engineers and atdarepresented dispatchers ns recently reached a tentative agreement with blet that would have further extended its contract with that union through 2014 however that agreement was not ratified by employees 

a tentative national agreement with iam was not ratified by employees negotiations with iam are being mediated by the national mediation board nmb a federal agency the status quo is preserved during mediation that is the union may not strike and management may not change the labor agreements while the nmb assists the parties in their efforts to reach agreement if the nmb were to terminate mediation it would at that time propose that the parties arbitrate their differences a strike could occur 30 days thereafter if the parties did not accept arbitration however the president of the united states of america could then appoint an emergency board which would delay any strike for a further 60 days while the board made recommendations and the parties engaged in further negotiations the outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at this time 

market risks and hedging activities 

ns has used derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

in 2001 ns began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption the intent of the program was to assist in the management of ns aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations which can significantly affect ns operating margins and profitability through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments no new hedges have been entered into since may of 2004 and the last remaining contracts were settled in the second quarter of 2006 bringing an end to the benefits from the program locomotive diesel fuel costs represented 14 of ns operating expenses for 2006 and 11 for 2005 

ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments and by entering into interestrate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio 

at dec 31 2007 ns debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 413 million a 1 point increase in interest rates would increase ns total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately 4 million management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

some of ns capital leases which carry an average fixed rate of 7 were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements on dec 31 2007 the average pay rate under these agreements was 5 and the average receive rate was 7 during 2007 and 2006 the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by 1 million and 1 million  respectively  a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yendenominated obligation most of these deposits are held by foreign banks primarily japanese as a result ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan  counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements this statement effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after nov 15 2007 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements ns will adopt the statement in the first quarter of 2008 and expects it will not have a material effect on ns’ consolidated financial statements 

fasb interpretation no fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” issued in june 2006 clarifies accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return under the guidelines of fin 48 an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination ns adopted this interpretation in the first quarter of 2007 see notes 1 and 3 

inflation 

in preparing financial statements us generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property ns a capitalintensive company has 

most of its capital invested in such assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

proposed legislation and regulations on safety and transportation of hazardous materials 

regulations proposed by the department of homeland security in late 2006 would mandate that railroads adopt chain of custody and security measures if enacted such regulations could cause service degradation and higher costs for the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials in addition certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders some legislators have contemplated prenotification requirements for hazardous material shipments if promulgated such ordinances could require the rerouting of hazardous materials shipments with the potential for significant additional costs and network inefficiencies accordingly ns will oppose efforts to impose unwarranted regulation in this area

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

norfolk southern’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the assistance of management evaluated the effectiveness of ns disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a‑15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of dec 31 2007 based on such evaluation such officers have concluded that as of dec 31 2007 ns disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in ns’ reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time period specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

internal control over financial reporting 

the management of norfolk southern is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting norfolk southern’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to its ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time

in order to ensure that norfolk southern’s internal control over financial reporting is effective management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of dec 31 2007 this assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  based on our assessment management has concluded that norfolk southern maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of dec 31 2007

the board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of norfolk southerns accounting policies financial reporting and internal control the audit committee of the board of directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee

norfolk southern’s management has issued a report of its assessment of internal control over financial reporting and norfolk southern’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on norfolk southern’s internal controls over financial reporting as of dec 31 2007 these reports appear in part ii item 8 of this report on form 10k

during the fourth quarter of 2007 management has not identified any changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect ns’ internal control over financial reporting

see the discussion of intermodal traffic in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

freight rates  in 2006 ns railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms thus a major portion of ns railroads freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government in general market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices 

in 2006 ns railroads were found by the stb to be “revenue adequate” based on results for the year 2005 a railroad is “revenue adequate” under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industrys composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement

railway property 

the ns railroad system extends across 22 states the district of columbia and portions of canada  the railroad infrastructure makes the company capital intensive with total property of approximately 21 billion 

capital expenditures  capital expenditures for road equipment and other property for the past five years were as follows including capitalized leases 

 

capital spending and maintenance programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable transportation services for 2007 ns has budgeted 134 billion of capital spending on may 1 2006 ns and kansas city southern kcs formed a joint venture msllc pursuant to which ns intends to contribute 300 million in cash substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements over a period of approximately three years in exchange for a 30 interest in the joint venture see the discussion following “cash used for investing activities” in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

equipment  as of dec 31 2006 ns owned or leased the following units of equipment 

 

the following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at dec 31 2006 

 

 fifty of the locomotives built in 2001 were purchased in 2002 

the following table shows the average age of ns’ locomotive and freight car fleets at dec 31 2006  and the number of retirements in 2006 

 

between 1988 and 2000 about 29000 coal cars were rebodied as a result the remaining serviceability of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the high percentage of freight cars built in earlier years 

 

ongoing freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety reliability customer satisfaction and equipment marketability the declines in 2006 2005 and 2003 reflected an increase in maintenance activity as well as the retirement of unserviceable units the locomotive bad order ratio includes units out of service for required inspections every 92 days and program work such as overhauls 

encumbrances  certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to approximately 534 million as of dec 31 2006 and 650 million as of dec 31 2005  

track maintenance  of the approximately 38000 total miles of track operated ns had responsibility for maintaining about 30000 miles of track with the remainder being operated under trackage rights 

over 75 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard approximately 45 of ns lines carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2006 

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding ns track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 

 

microwave system  the ns microwave system consisting of approximately 7400 radio route miles 424 core stations 14 secondary stations and 5 passive repeater stations provides communications between most operating locations the microwave system is used primarily for voice communications vhf radio control circuits data and facsimile transmissions traffic control operations and aei data transmissions

traffic control  of the approximately 16200 route miles owned by ns about 11000 miles are signalized including 8000 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 3000 miles of automatic block signals of the 8000 miles of ctc approximately 3000 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 244 base station radio sites 

computers  a computer network consisting of a centralized data center in atlanta  georgia  and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards terminals transportation offices rolling stock repair points sales offices and other key system locations operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data in addition the computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and services including payroll car and revenue accounting billing material management activities and controls and special studies 

environmental matters  compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal ns goal to date such compliance has not affected materially ns capital additions earnings liquidity or competitive position see “legal proceedings” part i item 3 “personal injury environmental and legal liabilities” in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees – the following table shows the average number of employees and the average cost per employee for wages and benefits 

 

approximately 85 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

government regulation  in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses ns railroads are subject to regulation by the stb the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers the federal railroad administration regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards 

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads begun over two decades ago under the staggers rail act of 1980 has continued significant exemptions are tofccofc ie “piggyback” business rail boxcar traffic lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing transportation contracts on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well for the duration of the contract about 84 of ns freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts 

efforts may be made in 2007 to resubject the rail industry to unwarranted federal economic regulation the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially reduced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly ns will oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation 

competition  there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprocess users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

ns primary rail competitor is the csx system both operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory ns also competes with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage 

certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets 




 item 1a risk factors 

ns is subject to significant governmental regulation and legislation over commercial environmental and operating matters railroads are subject to commercial regulation by the surface transportation board which has jurisdiction over some rates routes fuel surcharges conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers occasional efforts are made to resubject the rail industry to unwarranted federal economic regulation in addition congress could enact reregulation legislation economic reregulation of the rail industry could have a significant negative impact on ns’ ability to determine prices for rail services reduce capital spending on its rail network and result in a material adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns’ operations are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning among other things emissions to the air discharges to water ways or ground water supplies handling storage transportation and disposal of waste and other materials and the cleanup of hazardous material or petroleum releases the risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions past present and future – is inherent in the railroad business several of ns’ subsidiaries own or have owned land used as operating property or held for sale or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist on these properties and ns could incur environmental liabilities or costs the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time with respect to one or more of these properties moreover lawsuits and claims involving other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time and the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the federal railroad administration regulates a host of operations matters including track and mechanical equipment standards signaling systems testing and inspection of grade crossing warning devices hours of service of operating employees drug and alcohol testing locomotive engineer certification and reporting of employee injuries among other areas ns’ unintentional failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on ns and changes in the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which ns operates could adversely affect its business 

ns as a common carrier by rail must offer to transport hazardous materials regardless of risk transportation of certain hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses in terms of personal injury and property damage costs and compromise critical parts of our rail network legislation introduced in congress in early 2005 would give federal regulators increased authority to conduct investigations and levy substantial fines and penalties in connection with railroad accidents federal regulators also would be required to prescribe new regulations governing railroads’ transportation of hazardous materials legislation proposed in 2006 would require the department of homeland security dhs to develop rail security plans and the railroads to submit vulnerability assessments security plans and employee training programs to dhs for approval if enacted such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads regulations proposed in late 2006 by dhs mandating chain of custody and security measures likely will cause service degradation and higher costs for the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials further certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders some legislators have contemplated prenotification requirements for hazardous materials shipments if promulgated such ordinances could require the rerouting of hazardous materials shipments with the potential for significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

ns may be affected by terrorism or war any terrorist attack or other similar event any government response thereto and war or risk of war could cause significant business interruption and may adversely affect ns’ results of operations financial position and liquidity because ns plays a critical role in the nation’s transportation system it could become the target of such an attack or have a significant role in the government’s preemptive approach or response to an attack or war 

although ns currently maintains insurance coverage for thirdparty liability arising out of war and acts of terrorism it maintains only limited insurance coverage for firstparty property damage and damage to property in ns’ care custody or control caused by certain acts of terrorism in addition premiums for some or all of ns’ current insurance programs covering these losses could increase dramatically or insurance coverage for certain losses may not be available to ns in the future 

ns may be affected by general economic conditions prolonged negative changes in domestic and global economic conditions affecting the producers and consumers of the commodities ns carries may have an adverse effect on its operating results financial position and liquidity economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more large customers could have a significant impact on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns faces competition from other transportation providers ns is subject to competition from motor carriers railroads and to a lesser extent ships barges and pipelines on the basis of transit time pricing and the quality and reliability of service while ns has used primarily internal resources to build or acquire and maintain its rail system trucks and barges have been able to use public rightsofway maintained by public entities any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes of transportation in the regions in which ns operates or legislation granting materially greater latitude for motor carriers with respect to size or weight limitations could have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the operations of carriers with which ns interchanges may adversely affect its operations ns’ ability to provide rail service to customers in the us and canada depends in large part upon its ability to maintain cooperative relationships with connecting carriers with respect to among other matters freight rates revenue divisions car supply reciprocal switching interchange trackage rights and locomotive availability deterioration in the operations of or service provided by connecting carriers or in our relationship with those connecting carriers could result in ns’ inability to meet its customers’ demands or require ns to use alternate train routes which could result in significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

ns relies on technology and technology improvements in its business operations if ns experiences significant disruption or failure of one or more of its information technology systems including computer hardware software and communications equipment ns could experience a service interruption security breach or other operational difficulties which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations financial condition and liquidity additionally if ns does not have sufficient capital to acquire new technology or if it is unable to implement new technology ns may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service which could have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

the vast majority of ns employees belong to labor unions and labor agreements strikes or work stoppages could adversely affect its operations a pproximately 26000 or about 85 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions if unionized workers were to engage in a strike work stoppage or other slowdown ns could experience a significant disruption of its operations additionally future national labor agreements or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements could significantly increase ns’ costs for healthcare wages and other benefits any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures the nature of ns’ business exposes it to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury freight loss and other property damage and other matters jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to the federal employers’ liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded 

any material changes to current litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident involving any or all of freight loss or property damage personal injury and environmental liability could have a material adverse effect on ns’ operating results financial condition and liquidity to the extent not covered by insurance ns has obtained insurance for potential losses for thirdparty liability and firstparty property damages specified levels of risk are retained on a selfinsurance basis currently up to 25 million per occurrence for bodily injury and property damage to third parties and 25 million per occurrence for property owned by ns or in its care custody or control insurance is available from a limited number of insurers and may not continue to be available or if available may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to ns 

severe weather could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena including hurricanes and floods may cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs increased liabilities and decreased revenues which could have an adverse effect on ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

unpredictability of demand for rail services resulting in the unavailability of qualified personnel could adversely affect ns’ operational efficiency and ability to meet demand workforce demographics training requirements and the availability of qualified personnel particularly engineers and trainmen could each have a negative impact on ns’ ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increases in demand for rail services may exacerbate such risks which could have a negative impact on ns’ operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

ns may be affected by supply constraints resulting from disruptions in the fuel markets or the nature of some of its supplier markets ns consumes over 500 million gallons of diesel fuel each year fuel availability could be affected by any limitation in the fuel supply or by any imposition of mandatory allocation or rationing regulations if a severe fuel supply shortage arose from production curtailments disruption of oil imports disruption of domestic refinery production damage to refinery or pipeline infrastructure political unrest war or otherwise ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter could be affected also such an event would impact ns as well as its customers and other transportation companies 

due to the capital intensive nature and industryspecific requirements of the rail industry there are high barriers of entry for potential new suppliers of core railroad items such as locomotives and rolling stock equipment additionally ns competes with other industries for available capacity and raw materials used in the production of certain track materials such as rail and ties changes in the competitive landscapes of these limitedsupplier markets could result in increased prices or material shortages that could materially affect ns’ financial position results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

overview 

ns’ 2006 results reflect substantial increases in revenues up 880 million or 10 resulting primarily from higher pricing including increased fuel surcharges traffic volume in 2006 rose modestly as increases in the first half of the year were largely offset by declines in the second half particularly during the fourth quarter operating expenses rose 7 resulting in a 21 improvement in income from railway operations and a lower operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operation expenses of 728 compared with 752 in 2005 

higher operating income for the year translated into increased cash flows which combined with substantial proceeds from employee stock option exercises were used to fund increased capital expenditures purchase and retire common stock increase dividends and pay maturing debt at dec 31 2006 the cash and shortterm investment balance was 918 million loo ki ng ahead ns expects revenue increases to continue but at a more moderate pace reflecting lower volume growth and comparison with a strong 2006 ns plans to continue its focus on improving service levels and maintaining a marketbased approach to pricing approximately onehalf of ns’ revenue base is subject to renegotiation or repricing in 2007 

during 2006 ns purchased and retired 218 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 964 million under the share repurchase program approved by the board of directors on nov 22 2005 under the program the board has authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of ns common stock through dec 31 2015 

summarized results of operations 

2006 compared with 2005 

net income in 2006 was 15 billion or 357 per diluted share up 200 million or 16 compared with 13 billion or 311 per diluted share in 2005 the increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations offset in part by the absence of the 96 million income tax benefit recorded in 2005 because of ohio tax law changes see note 3 railway operating revenues increased 880 million reflecting higher rates including fuel surcharges that accounted for about 40 of the increase and modestly higher traffic volume railway operating expenses rose 440 million or 7 principally due to higher diesel fuel prices and increased compensation and benefit costs 

2005 compared with 2004 

net income in 2005 was 13 billion or 311 per diluted share up 371 million or 41 compared with 910 million or 228 per diluted share in 2004 results in 2005 reflected a 96 million second quarter income tax benefit related to ohio tax law changes see note 3 while results in 2004 included a 40 million net gain related to the conrail corporate reorganization see note 4 the remaining 315 million increase in net income was primarily due to higher income from railway operations railway operating revenues increased 12 billion reflecting higher rates including the favorable effects of the coal rate cases settled in the second quarter – see below fuel surcharges and increased traffic volume railway operating expenses rose 800 million or 14 principally due to higher diesel fuel prices increased volumerelated expenses and casualty claims costs 

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

railway operating revenues were 94 billion in 2006 85 billion in 2005 and 73 billion in 2004 the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volume and average revenue per unit by market group prior period amounts for the chemicals agricultureconsumer productsgovernment and paperclayforest groups have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

 

revenues increased 880 million or 10 in 2006 and 12 billion or 17 in 2005 as shown in the following table both revenue improvements were the result of increased average revenues per unit including fuel surcharges and to a lesser extent in 2006 than for 2005 higher traffic volumes 

 

both comparisons reflect large increases in average revenue per unit a result of higher rates and increased fuel surcharges all market groups collected significant fuel surcharges which accounted for approximately 40 of the 2006 increase in revenues and about onethird of the 2005 increase at yearend 2006 fuel surcharge provisions covered approximately 91 of total revenues compared with about 85 at the end of 2005 traffic volume increased 1 in 2006 principally due to higher intermodal and metalsconstruction shipments in 2005 traffic volume rose 4 reflecting a 9 increase in intermodal shipments the favorable revenue per unitmix variance in 2005 included an unfavorable mix component reflecting the 9 rise in intermodal traffic which has a lower average revenue per unit 

on april 24 2006  ns announced that it was revising its fuel surcharge program for nonintermodal traffic originating and moving on nsissued tariffs and public quotes issued on or after july 1 2006  while the mechanics of the new fuel surcharge are generally the same as the previous fuel surcharge the trigger price was raised from 23 to 64 per barrel of west texas intermediate wti crude oil and the percentage by which the line haul rate is increased when oil exceeds the trigger price was decreased from 04 to 03 for each dollar or portion thereof in excess of the trigger price tariff prices and public quotes have been adjusted to reflect this change the fuel surcharge is based on the monthly average price of wti in the second calendar month prior to the month in which the fuel surcharge is applied application of the new fuel surcharge across tariff and public quotes as well as contracts now approximates 15 of ns’ total revenue base 

on january 26 2007 the surface transportation board stb issued a decision that the type of fuel surcharge imposed by ns and most other large railroads – a fuel surcharge based on a percentage of line haul revenue – would no longer be permitted for regulated traffic that moves under public tariff rates the stb gave the railroads a 90‑day transition period to adjust their fuel surcharge programs ns does not expect that compliance with these new regulations will have a material effect on its financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

coal revenues increased 215 million or 10 compared with 2005 which reflected higher average revenue per unit and slightly higher traffic volume coal average revenue per unit was up 9 compared with 2005 reflecting increased fuel surcharges and higher rates tempered by the absence of the 55 million benefit from the coal rate settlements in the second quarter of 2005 see below coal represented 25 of ns’ revenues in 2006 and 79 of shipments handled originated on ns’ lines traffic volumes rose 1 primarily because of increased shipments of utility coal domestic metallurgical coal and coke that offset lower export and iron ore shipments 

ns is currently involved in litigation with virginia electric and power companyold dominion electric cooperative virginia power regarding rate adjustment provisions in a transportation contract between them during the third quarter of 2006 a court order was entered in favor of ns and in the fourth quarter virginia power filed a petition with the virginia supreme court appealing this order future developments and the ultimate resolution of this matter could result in ns recognizing additional revenues related to this dispute which could have a favorable impact on results of operations in a particular year or quarter 

in 2005 coal revenues increased 387 million or 22 compared with 2004 reflecting higher average revenue per unit and increased traffic volume coal average revenue per unit was up 19 compared with 2004 reflecting higher rates the favorable effects of fuel surcharges longerhaul business and the rate cases settled in the second quarter see below coal represented 25 of ns’ revenues in 2005 and 83 of shipments handled originated on ns’ lines traffic volumes rose 3 primarily because of increased shipments of utility coal that offset lower export and domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore shipments 

during the second quarter of 2005 ns entered into settlement agreements with two utility customers that resolved their rail transportation rate cases before the stb in 2002 these customers each filed rate reasonableness complaints with the stb in october 2004 the stb found ns’ rates to be reasonable in both cases as a result of the settlement of these cases ns recognized 55 million of additional coal revenue in 2005 related to the period in dispute 

 utility coal tonnage increased 4 compared with 2005 reflecting the rebuilding of stockpiles by customers more shipments from the powder river basin in the west and higher shipments of import coal through charleston  sc 

in 2005 utility coal tonnage increased 6 compared to 2004 in response to increased coalfired generation to meet the heavier electricity demand of a strong economy limited nuclear power generation capacity higher natural gas prices and utility coal stockpiles which were below target levels across ns’ service area supply constraints dampened shipments while the increased demand for eastern us coal prompted some customers to shift to coal from nontraditional sources in wyoming and colorado and imported coal appalachian coal production increased modestly and western coal production was up 2 in 2005 

while natural gas prices are expected to remain higher in 2007 demand for utility coal could be tempered by persistent mild winter weather in the east and above average stockpiles additionally in november 2006 virginia power announced it intends to switch from domestic coal to imported coal for its chesapeake  virginia  energy center  since ns would not transport the imported coal this change would result in the loss of approximately 16 million tons annually 

a number of evolving environmental issues could affect the utility coal market these include potential regional programs aimed at capping and reducing power plant co 2 emissions and ongoing efforts at addressing climate change in response to changes in environmental regulations certain utilities have begun adding or are planning to add emissions control technologies to their electric generating units allowing them to utilize their existing coalfired power plants 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage increased 4 in 2006 compared with 2005 the increase was driven by higher domestic metallurgical coal and coke shipments in the first half of the year in response to steelma ki ng demand which more than offset a decline in iron ore volume caused by the shutdown of a blast furnace at a major customer location 

for 2005 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage was down 3 compared with 2004 declines in domestic coke and iron ore volumes principally due to the idling of a major steel blast furnace were partially offset by an 8 increase in metallurgical coal 

demand for domestic metallurgical coal and coke is expected to decline slightly with a softening in the steel industry in 2007 whereas new business is expected to modestly increase iron ore shipments 

export coal tonnage decreased 15 in 2006 compared to 2005 reflecting weaker demand for us coal as europe and asia continued to increase purchases from other countries baltimore volume was down approximately 13500 cars or 37 and norfolk volume declined by approximately 3000 cars or 3 

in 2005 export coal tonnage decreased 12 compared to 2004 due to both coal supply constraints and a weak european steel market volume through norfolk and baltimore decreased norfolk was down approximately 16000 carloads or 14 and baltimore was down approximately 2000 carloads or 6 us exports in 2005 were constrained by several factors 1 the tight coal supply from eastern coal mines caused primarily by the sporadic closure of a major coal mine 2 the idling of production by european steel manufacturers in order to manage finished goods inventory and 3 the abundant supply of chinese coke on the world market lowering the price and ma ki ng it more economical to buy coke rather than import metallurgical coal from the us and convert it 

export coal tonnage for 2007 is expected to weaken as higher mining costs offset potential gains from favorable ocean freight rates from the us versus australia  

other coal tonnage principally steam coal shipped to industrial plants decreased 3 versus 2005 primarily due to plant closures and mine production problems in 2005 other coal tonnage decreased 3 versus 2004 primarily due to the diversion of coal to the utility market 

general merchandise revenues increased 520 million or 11 in 2006 compared with 2005 as all market groups posted higher average revenue per unit driven by increased rates and fuel surcharges traffic volume declined slightly as improved metals and construction and agriculture volumes were offset by declines in the other business groups in 2005 general merchandise revenues increased 13 due to higher average rates and fuel surcharges traffic volume was up modestly in 2005 compared with 2004 as decreases in automotive and chemicals traffic partially offset increases in other business groups 

metals and construction revenue increased 19 and traffic volume increased 5 in 2006 compared with 2005 as declines in the fourth quarter were offset by higher volumes through the rest of the year revenue per unit rose 14 because of increased rates and fuel surcharges the increase in traffic volume was driven primarily by higher import slab business to nsserved steel mills more scrap metal shipments and higher sand gravel and cement traffic for commercial and highway construction projects 

in 2005 metals and construction revenue increased 20 and traffic volume increased 2 compared with 2004 revenue per unit rose 17 because of higher rates and fuel surcharges the volume improvements were due primarily to continued strength at nsserved integrated and electric arc mills and higher aluminum product shipments which were partially offset by lower scrap metal carloads construction traffic volume benefited from increased residential commercial and highway construction 

metals and construction volume is expected to be tempered in the first quarter of 2007 reflecting a softening in domestic steel production affecting iron and steel shipments with improving conditions expected in the second half of the year aggregate and cement shipments are expected to increase driven by highway projects and new stone terminals locating on ns’ lines 

chemicals revenue increased 10 despite a 4 drop in traffic volume reflecting increased rates and fuel surcharges petroleum industrial and plastics traffic volumes were down as a result of lower inventories arising from postkatrina conditions the closure of several plants on ns lines and the weaker housing and automotive markets 

in 2005 chemicals revenues increased 13 reflecting higher prices and fuel surcharges while traffic volume was down slightly as a result of production curtailment in the gulf coast region and as compared with a strong 2004 volume increases for plastic and petroleum products were offset by decreases in industrial and miscellaneous chemicals 

chemical volume is expected to improve in 2007 supported by new and expanded business as the year progresses however volume could be adversely affected by the price of natural gas and crude oil which accounts for more than 50 of the cost of many chemical products and presents a significant competitive challenge that could cause domestic chemical producers to move production overseas 

agriculture consumer products and government revenue increased 19 and traffic volume increased 4 in 2006 compared with 2005 average revenue per unit rose 15 a result of higher rates and fuel surcharges traffic volume growth resulted from increased ethanol military and corn shipments military traffic growth was primarily due to the continued support of military operations in iraq  

in 2005 agriculture consumer products and government revenue increased 16 and traffic volume increased 2 compared with 2004 average revenue per unit rose 14 a result of higher rates and fuel surcharges traffic growth resulted from sweeteners government traffic and fertilizer government traffic growth was primarily due to the support of military operations in iraq as well as shipments of temporary housing to hurricanedamaged areas ethanol traffic increased 38 due to higher shipments from current customers in addition to new business in georgia and south carolina  

agriculture volume is expected to continue to grow in 2007 benefiting from increasing demand for ethanol as a replacement for mtbe which was banned by the federal government as a fuel additive however declines in consumer products and government volumes are expected to offset this growth 

automotive revenues declined 2 in 2006 compared with 2005 as lower volumes offset increased average revenues per unit including fuel surcharges volume decreased 9 primarily due to substantial production cuts at ford general motors and daimlerchrysler assembly plants including two nsserved plant closures at ford and one at general motors during 2006 ford and general motors combined operate 15 of 29 assembly plants served by ns reduced production at honda and bmw also contributed to the volume decrease 

in 2005 automotive revenues rose 5 compared with 2004 the result of an 8 increase in average revenue per unit that reflected pricing improvements and higher fuel surcharges in contrast traffic volume decreased 3 primarily due to reduced production at ford and general motors with general motors closing nsserved assembly plants in michigan  maryland and new jersey  these reductions were partially offset by increased production at honda mercedesbenz and toyota  

for 2007 ns expects automotive revenues to continue to decline as a result of automotive production cutbacks decreases by us automotive manufacturers are expected to be partially offset by higher domestic production by foreign manufacturers 

paper clay and forest products revenue increased 11 in 2006 compared with 2005 due to higher average revenues per unit including fuel surcharges despite a 1 decrease in traffic volume higher solid waste and debris traffic and growth in traffic from the import of printing paper partially offset reduced pulp and pulp board shipments 

in 2005 paper clay and forest products revenue increased 16 and traffic volume increased 2 compared with 2004 average revenue per unit rose 13 due to higher rates and fuel surcharges pulp board printing paper newsprint and woodchip produced volume gains despite consolidations within the industry and mill shutdowns 

in 2007 paper clay and forest product revenues are expected to be up slightly and benefit from continued growth in waste and debris transportation 

intermodal revenues increased 145 million or 8 compared with 2005 largely because of higher fuel surcharges increased rates and improved traffic volume traffic volume for the year rose 3 notwithstanding a 3 decline in the fourth quarter international traffic volume rose 9 reflecting growth in imported goods from asia and exported goods through nsserved east coast ports as well as west coast ports truckload volume increased 8 reflecting continued expansion of business with traditional truckload companies triple crown services company a service with railtohighway trailers had flat volume compared with 2005 as higher consumer product shipments were offset by weaker automotiverelated shipments domestic intermodal marketing companies imc volume declined 9 reflecting declines in the housing construction and automotive markets premium business which includes parcel and ltl lessthantruckload carriers was down 3 reflecting lower ltl shipper traffic that offset modest gains in parcel shipments intermodal revenue per unit increased 4 principally a result of higher fuel surcharges as well as increased rates and longerhaul international traffic which was offset in part by the ongoing shift of shipments from higher revenue per unit railprovided assets trailers and containers to lower revenue per unit shipments in shipperprovided equipment 

in 2005 intermodal revenues increased 289 million or 19 compared with 2004 reflecting improved traffic volume higher fuel surcharges and increased rates despite moderated growth in domestic business traffic volume increased 9 reflecting strength in the international truckload and triple crown services lines of business  international traffic volume grew by 16 reflecting strength in us consumer markets and growth in the movement of import and export goods through nsserved east coast ports as well as west coast ports truckload volume increased 10 compared with 2004 reflecting additional business with traditional truckload companies premium business grew 6 due primarily to new business in the northern region triple crown services volume grew 6 reflecting expanded geographic coverage and increased trailer fleet size to meet higher demand domestic volume decreased 3 compared with 2004 principally due to the continued reduction in transloading of west coast international freight into domestic containers intermodal revenue per unit increased 9 a result of fuel surcharges and rate increases 

in 2007 ns expects moderate growth in its intermodal markets with continued strength in the international markets future growth may however be tempered by economic conditions in the us 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses in 2006 were 69 billion up 440 million or 7 compared to 2005 which were up 800 million compared to 2004 the 2006 increase was principally due to higher diesel fuel prices and increased compensation and benefits the increase in 2005 was principally due to a sharp rise in the price of diesel fuel volumerelated expense increases more maintenance activities and higher casualty costs carloads rose 1 in 2006 compared to 2005 and 4 in 2005 compared to 2004 

the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses improved to 728 in 2006 compared with 752 in 2005 and 767 in 2004 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

 

compensation and benefits  which represents nearly 40 of total railway operating expenses increased 144 million or 6 compared with 2005 and increased 221 million in 2005 or 10 compared with 2004 expenses in 2006 included the effect of the implementation of statement of accounting standards no 123r “sharebased payment” which increased stockbased compensation expense by 27 million most of the increase was reflected in the first quarter which included the effect of accelerated recognition of costs related to grants to retirementeligible employees this up front recognition of costs will occur in the first quarter of 2007 and is expected to be somewhat higher reflecting a higher proportion of retirement eligible grantees the remaining increase was attributable to increased salaries and wages up 44 million higher health and welfare benefit costs up 29 million higher payroll taxes up 17 million retirement and waiver agreements entered into in the first quarter up 13 million and the cost of the regular stockbased grant to the former chief executive officer who retired in the first quarter 11 million 

ns employment averaged 30541 in 2006 compared with 30294 in 2005 and 28475 in 2004 the increased number of employees has come almost exclusively in operating department personnel to meet the increased volume and service needs as well as expected retirements ns continues to hire and train additional workers in order to meet the requirements of forecasted volumes in light of the demographics of its work force 

the increase in compensation and benefits for 2005 reflected increased hours for train operations including trainees and equipment maintenance up 70 million increased wage rates up 46 million increased pension postretirement and health and welfare benefit costs up 43 million higher stockbased compensation up 22 million and higher payroll taxes up 12 million 

the railroad retirement and survivors’ improvement act which took effect jan 1 2002 allows for investment of tier ii assets in a diversified portfolio through the national railroad retirement investment trust the law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of tier ii payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a fouryear reserve or exceed a sixyear reserve as a result the employers’ portion of tier ii retirement payroll taxes has been reduced from 131 in 2004 to 126 in 2005 and 2006 and to 121 for 2007 however these savings are expected to continue to be substantially offset by higher payroll taxes on increased wages and a higher wage base 

materials services and rents includes costs related to items used for the maintenance of railroad lines structures and equipment the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses increased 86 million or 5 in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased 13 in 2005 compared to 2004 for 2006 materials expense was up 39 million due to increased maintenance activities purchased services was up 39 million reflecting increased intermodal traffic volume and equipment rents rose 8 million 

the increase in 2005 reflected higher volumerelated purchased services up 82 million and higher maintenance expense up 74 million equipment rents rose 28 million reflecting higher traffic volume as well as leases from the conrail corporate reorganization see note 4 

locomotive and freight car repair costs increased in 2006 and in 2005 due to more maintenance activity related to higher usage from increased traffic volumes coupled with the age of the fleet this level of expense is expected to continue and may increase depending on traffic volumes 

equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment rose 2 in 2006 and increased 11 in 2005 the increase in 2006 was principally due to a reduction in rents received on automotive equipment as a result of decreased shipments the increase in 2005 was principally due to additional lease expense for a full year from the conrail corporate reorganization and increased volumerelated intermodal shipments 

conrail rents and services decreased 3 million or 2 in 2006 compared to 2005 and decreased 60 in 2005 compared to 2004 for 2006 and 2005 this item includes amounts due to conrail for operation of the shared assets areas before the conrail corporate reorganization in 2004 this item included amounts due to prr for use of its operating properties and equipment ns’ equity in conrail’s net earnings and the additional amortization related to the difference between ns’ investment in conrail and its underlying equity see note 4 the decline in 2005 was primarily driven by the conrail corporate reorganization which resulted in the consolidated reporting of individual components of conrail equity earnings principally depreciation equipment rents and interest expense see note 4 ns’ share of equity earnings after the conrail corporate reorganization is a component of “other incomenet” see note 2 

depreciation expense decreased 36 million or 5 in 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting the results of an equipment depreciation study from an independent firm of engineers and an analysis of the assets received in the conrail corporation reorganization completed in 2006 depreciation expense increased 29 in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily a result of the conrail corporate reorganization see note 4 in addition substantial capital investments and improvements resulted in higher depreciation expense 

diesel fuel expense increased 250 million or 34 in 2006 compared with 2005 and increased 62 in 2005 compared with 2004 diesel fuel expense is recorded net of hedge benefits although there have been no such benefits since may 2006 when the program wound down see “market risks and hedging activities” below and note 16 expense in 2006 included hedge benefits of 20 million compared with benefits of 148 million in 2005 and 140 million in 2004 and reflected a 13 rise in the average price per gallon with a 1 increase in consumption the increase in 2005 reflected a 43 rise in the average price per gallon and a 2 increase in consumption 

legislation enacted in the first quarter of 2005 repealed the 43 cents per gallon excise tax on railroad diesel fuel for 2007 with the following phased reductions in 2005 and 2006 1 cent per gallon from jan 1 2005 through june 30 2005 2 cents per gallon from july 1 2005 through dec 31 2006 and by the full 43 cents thereafter ns consumes about 520 million gallons of diesel fuel per year 

casualties and other claims expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters decreased 4 million or 2 in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased 48 in 2005 compared to 2004 the decrease in 2006 reflected the absence of 38 million of costs associated with a derailment in graniteville  south carolina see discussion below and an unfavorable jury verdict in an employee injury case partially offset by higher expenses arising from derailments and insurance costs the increase in 2005 was attributable to the costs associated with the graniteville derailment 16 million for an unfavorable jury verdict rendered in an employee injury case 9 million of higher insurance costs and 4 million for the portion of the 125 million selfinsured retention related to hurricane katrina expenses 

on jan 6 2005  a collision in graniteville  south carolina  between two ns trains caused the release of chlorine gas from a ruptured tank car ns’ liability related to this accident includes a current and longterm portion which represents ns’ best estimate based on current facts and circumstances the estimate includes amounts related to business property damage and other economic losses personal injury and individual property damage claims as well as thirdparty response costs ns’ commercial insurance policies are expected to cover substantially all expenses related to this derailment above ns’ selfinsured retention including ns’ response costs and legal fees accordingly the consolidated balance sheets reflect a current and longterm receivable for estimated recoveries from ns’ insurance carriers the expense recorded in 2005 represents ns’ retention under its insurance policies and other uninsured costs while it is reasonable to expect that the liability for covered losses could differ from the amount recorded such a change would be offset by a corresponding change in the insurance receivable as a result ns does not believe that it is reasonably likely that its net loss the difference between the liability and future recoveries will be materially different than the loss recorded in 2005 ns expects at this time that insurance coverage is adequate to cover potential claims and settlements above its selfinsurance retention 

during the third quarter of 2005 ns’ operations were adversely affected by hurricane katrina and to a lesser extent hurricane rita both of which struck the gulf coast  ns sustained damage to its facilities in the region as a result of hurricane katrina but restored rail freight service into and around new orleans in a relatively short period of time the damage sustained to ns facilities as a result of hurricane katrina did not materially impact ns’ financial condition or results of operations and is covered by insurance above the selfinsurance retention limit 

the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs cases involving occupational injuries comprised about twothirds of total employee injury cases resolved and about onethird of total payments made with its longestablished commitment to safety ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs with respect to occupational injuries which are not caused by a specific accident or event but result from a claimed exposure over time the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades 

the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased system which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers compensation system 

ns maintains substantial amounts of insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims it also retains reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance see note 17 ns expects insurance costs to be slightly higher in 2007 

other expenses increased 3 million or 1 in 2006 compared to 2005 and increased 34 million or 15 in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase in 2006 was primarily due to higher employee travel and relocation costs offset in part by lower property taxes the increase in 2005 reflected higher property and sales and use taxes 

other income – net 

other income – net was 149 million in 2006 and 74 million in 2005 see note 2 results in 2006 reflected lower expense associated with tax credit investments primarily due to synthetic fuel related investments see discussion under heading “income taxes” greater interest income and higher returns from corporateowned life insurance that were partially offset by lower equity in conrail earnings 

in 2005 other income – net decreased by 2 million which reflected the absence of the 40 million gain recognized in 2004 for the conrail corporate reorganization the results in 2005 also reflected 1 higher interest income 2 equity in earnings of conrail subsequent to the conrail corporate reorganization 3 additional coal royalties up 12 million and 4 lower interest accruals related to tax liabilities down 9 million these income improvements were partially offset by more expense associated with tax credit investments 

income taxes 

income tax expense in 2006 was 749 million for an effective rate of 34 compared with effective rates of 25 in 2005 and 29 in 2004 the increase in the rate for 2006 was largely the result of the absence of an ohio tax law change which lowered the effective rate in 2005 as well as fewer tax credits from synthetic fuel related investments see below the 2005 effective rate benefited from a 96 million reduction in deferred taxes resulting from the ohio tax legislation which lowered the rate by six percentage points see note 3 

ns’ consolidated federal income tax returns for 2004 and 2005 are being audited by the internal revenue service irs the irs completed its examination of the 2002 and 2003 consolidated federal income tax returns during the third quarter of 2006 and ns has appealed certain adjustments proposed by the irs the results of the examination had a negligible effect on the effective tax rate 

ns’ synthetic fuel tax credits are subject to reduction if the reference price of a barrel of oil for the year falls within an inflationadjusted phaseout range specified by the tax code the reference price for a year is the annual average wellhead price per barrel of unregulated domestic crude oil as determined by the secretary of the treasury by april 1 of the following year in 2005 the phaseout range was 5320 to 6679 and the phaseout range is adjusted annually for inflation while ns cannot predict with certainty the reference price for the year ns estimated a 35  phaseout of synthetic fuel credits in 2006 based on actual oil prices during the year 

net income in 2006 reflects 18 million less in net benefits from these credits as compared with the same period of 2005 as shown below 

 

subject to the uncertainty associated with these tax credits the effective tax rate in 2007 is expected to be comparable to that of 2006 the tax credits generated by ns’ synthetic fuel related investments expire at the end of 2007 and accordingly the effective tax rate may increase thereafter 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities ns principal source of liquidity was 22 billion in 2006 compared with 21 billion in 2005 and 17 billion in 2004 the improvement in 2006 reflected the 440 million increase in income from railway operations offset in part by higher income tax payments the increase in 2005 reflected the 415 million increase in income from railway operations as well as the effects of the conrail corporate reorganization see below offset in part by higher income tax payments including a payment made upon settlement of a federal audit cycle 

prior to the august 2004 conrail corporate reorganization see note 4 a significant portion of the payments made to prr under the operating and lease agreements which were included in “conrail rents and services” and therefore were a use of cash in “net cash provided by operating activities” was borrowed back from a subsidiary of prr under a note due in 2032 and therefore was a source of cash in “proceeds from borrowings” ns’ net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to 118 million in 2004 this note was effectively extinguished by the reorganization in 2004 subsequent to the conrail corporate reorganization 2005 payments under “conrail rents and services” declined depreciation charges increased and those net borrowings were terminated accordingly ns’ cash provided by operating activities after the conrail corporate reorganization has increased 

ns had wor ki ng capital of 307 million at dec 31 2006 compared with wor ki ng capital of 729 million at dec 31 2005 the reduction was largely due to share repurchases made in 2006 see note 13 and higher current maturities of longterm debt ns’ cash cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances totaled 918 million and 13 billion at dec 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

contractual obligations at dec 31 2006 comprised of ns longterm debt including capital leases see note 7 operating leases see note 8 agreements with crc see note 4 unconditional purchase obligations see note 17 and longterm advances from conrail see note 4 were as follows 

 

off balance sheet arrangements consist of obligations related to operating leases which are included in the table of contractual obligations above and disclosed in note 8 ns did not renew its accounts receivable securitization program which expired in may 2005 

cash used for investing activities was 684 million in 2006 compared with 18 billion in 2005 and 12 billion in 2004 the decrease in 2006 reflected higher proceeds from shortterm investment sales principally to fund share repurchases reflected in financing activities offset in part by the 100 million investment in meridian speedway llc msllc see discussion below and increased property additions the increase in 2005 was principally the result of larger purchases of shortterm investments  

property additions account for most of the recurring spending in this category the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 

 

 

 

the higher average age of locomotives in 2006 reflects the retirement of two locomotives compared with 52 retired in 2005 

for 2007 ns has budgeted 134 billion for capital expenditures the anticipated spending includes 884 million for roadway projects 401 million for equipment and 55 million for small projects and real estate in roadway projects 610 million is for track and bridge program work including 73 million in infrastructure investments for increased main line and terminal capacity also included are projects for communications signal and electrical systems as well as projects for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations and signal upgrades other roadway projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives including increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution facilities and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure planned equipment spending of 401 million includes the purchase of 53 locomotives and upgrades to existing units the purchase of 1300 new higher capacity coal cars as part of a multiyear program to replace the existing coal car fleet the purchase of 739 freight cars as their lease expires improvements to multilevel automobile racks and projects related to computers and information technology including additional security and backup systems ns expects to make all of its capital expenditures with internally generated funds 

on may 1 2006 ns and kansas city southern kcs formed a joint venture msllc pursuant to which ns intends to contribute 300 million in cash substantially all of which will be used for capital improvements over a period of approximately three years in exchange for a 30 interest in the joint venture at the formation of msllc  ns contributed 100 million and kcs contributed its 320 mile rail line between meridian  mississippi and shreveport  louisiana the meridian speedway ns is recognizing its pro rata share of the joint venture’s earnings or loss as required under the equity method of accounting ns’ total investment in msllc is supported by the fair value of the rail line as well as intangible assets obtained through the transaction the transaction is expected to be modestly dilutive in the early years of the venture due to lost interest income on the cash contributed to the joint venture however ns expects that the dilution from the lost interest income will be offset from additional traffic as the investment is made and improvements are completed the joint venture is expected to increase capacity and improve service over the meridian speedway into the southeast 

during the third quarter of 2006 ns and the states of ohio  west virginia and virginia each entered into a memorandum of agreement with the federal highway administration that governs the release of up to 95 million in federal funding and up to 11 million in state funding for the heartland corridor rail doublestack clearance project ns expects to spend about 60 million over a fiveyear period in connection with this project the heartland corridor is a package of proposed clearance improvements and other facilities that will create a seamless highcapacity intermodal route across virginia and west virginia to midwest markets 

ns and other railroads have agreed to participate in the chicago region environmental and transportation efficiency create project in chicago  the intent of the proposed publicprivate partnership is to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan chicago area a portion of the public funding has been approved and the parties are wor ki ng to develop a list of projects to be included in phase i of the project funding requirements will be determined by the selection of phase i projects the railroads expect to complete phase i over the next four years

cash used for financing activities was 13 billion in 2006 compared with 456 million in 2005 and 233 million in 2004 financing activity in 2006 included 964 million for the purchase and retirement of common stock as part of ns’ ongoing share repurchase program see discussion below financing activities for 2006 also included 212 million of proceeds and 85 million of tax benefits from employee exercises of stock options see note 11 

in 2005 financing activity included 1 the issuance of 300 million aggregate principal amount of 6 unsecured notes due march 2105 and 2 the issuance of 717 million of unsecured notes 350 million at 564 due 2029 and 367 million at 559 due 2025 and payment of 218 million of premium in exchange for 717 million of previously issued unsecured notes 350 million at 78 due 2027 200 million at 725 due 2031 and 167 million at 90 due 2021 see note 7 the 218 million cash premium payment is reflected as a reduction of debt in the consolidated balance sheets and statement of cash flows and will be amortized as additional interest expense over the terms of the new debt financing activities in 2005 included 194 million in proceeds relating to employee exercises of stock options ns’ debttototal capitalization ratio was 407 at dec 31 2006 and 428 at dec 31 2005 

in november 2005 ns’ board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of ns common stock through dec 31 2015 the timing and volume of any purchases will be guided by management’s assessment of market conditions and other factors nearterm purchases under the program are expected to be made with internally generated cash however future funding sources could include proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes or the issuance of longterm debt

ns currently has in place and available a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement that expires in 2009 which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at dec 31 2006  and ns is in compliance with all of the financial covenants ns also has in place a shelf registration statement on form s3 filed with the sec in september 2004 with 700 million of available capacity see note 7 on july 18 2005  standard  poor’s sp upgraded its ratings on ns’ unsecured debt from bbb to bbb moody’s rating remains at baa1 comparable to sp’s 

application of critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require management to change them accordingly management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances management discusses the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 10 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance management engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to assist it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 

ns net pension benefit which is included in “compensation and benefits” on its consolidated statements of income was 29 million for the year ended dec 31 2006 in recording this amount ns assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 9 investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10 15 and 20year periods has been a rate of return in excess of 10 and supports the current rate of return assumption a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 19 million change to the pension credit and as a result an equal change in “compensation and benefits” expense changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future the net pension asset is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment in light of the timing of expected benefit payments specifically ns refers to moody’s seasoned aa corporate bond yields and the changes in such yields therefore management has little discretion in this assumption 

ns net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was 70 million for the year ended dec 31 2006 in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits which is included in “other postretirement benefits” as disclosed in note 10 management estimated future increases in healthcare costs these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note 10 

properties and depreciation 

most of ns total assets are comprised of longlived railway properties see note 5 as disclosed in note 1 ns properties are depreciated using group depreciation rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by grosston miles other properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value 

ns depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement these assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation studies that are performed by an outside firm of consulting engineers these studies analyze ns historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices ns recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense the studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property ns depreciation expense for the year ended dec 31 2006 amounted to 738 million ns weightedaverage depreciation rates for 2006 are disclosed in note 5 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 26 million increase or decrease to ns depreciation expense 

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

ns expense for “casualties and other claims” amounted to 220 million for the year ended dec 31 2006 most of this expense was composed of ns accrual related to personal injury liabilities jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded in all cases ns records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable 

ns engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year for employee personal injury cases the actuarial firm studies ns historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements ta ki ng into account relevant outside influences an estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims is based on the results of this analysis for occupational injury claims the actuarial firm studies ns’ history of claim filings severity payments and other relevant facts additionally the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting ns’ experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which ns would recognize when such a change became known the most recent actuarial study completed in the fourth quarter of 2006 resulted in a slight increase to ns personal injury liability during the fourth quarter while the liability recorded is support ed by the most recent study it is reasonably possible that the liability could be higher or lower 

ns is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations it is ns policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 17 claims if any against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by ns are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the consolidated balance sheets and are not netted against the associated ns liability environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy 

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately 19 million in 2006 16 million in 2005 and 11 million in 2004 and capital expenditures totaled approximately 6 million in 2006 and 9 million in each of 2005 and 2004 capital expenditures in 2007 are expected to be comparable to those in 2006 

ns consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of 54 million at dec 31 2006 and 58 million at dec 31 2005 of which 12 million was accounted for as a current liability at dec 31 2006  and 2005 at dec 31 2006 the liability represented ns estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 172 identified locations on that date 15 sites accounted for 29 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period 

at some of the 172 locations certain ns subsidiaries usually in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statutes which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs 

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss and that participants ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities 

based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which ns is aware further management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to expenses while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments in managements opinion the recorded liability if any is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

on oct 19 2006 the pennsylvania department of environmental protection pdep issued an assessment of civil penalties against ns and filed a complaint for civil penalties with the pennsylvania environmental hearing board ehb requesting that the ehb impose civil penalties upon ns for alleged violations of state environmental laws and regulations resulting from a discharge of sodium hydroxide which occurred as a result of the derailment of a ns train in norwich township pennsylvania on june 30 2006 the pdep’s actions seek to impose combined penalties of 8890000 for alleged past violations and 46420 per day for alleged ongoing violations of state environmental laws and regulations ns believes that the monetary penalties sought by the pdep are excessive accordingly ns intends to vigorously defend the action and has appealed the fines to the ehb in addition ns expects the pennsylvania fish and boat commission to impose a monetary penalty on ns for damages alleged to have been caused by this accident ns does not believe that the outcome of these proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position results of operations or liquidity 

income taxes 

ns net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 64 billion at dec 31 2006 see note 3 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns  for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized ns had a 9 million valuation allowance on 637 million of deferred tax assets as of dec 31 2006 reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized in addition ns has a recorded liability for its estimate of potential income tax exposures management believes this liability for potential exposure to be adequate income tax expense is adjusted to the extent the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded for every one half percent change in the 2006 effective rate net income would have changed by 11 million 

other matters 

labor agreements 

approximately 26000 or about 85 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act rla ns largely bargains in concert with other major railroads moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose labor agreement changes the current bargaining round began in late 2004 industry issues include contracting out of certain work and employee contributions for medical and other benefits 

after a period of direct negotiations either party may file for mediation if it believes insufficient progress is being made the status quo is preserved during mediation while a federal mediator assists the parties in their efforts to reach agreement the railroads are currently in mediation with all of the involved labor unions if the national mediation board a federal agency were to terminate mediation it would at that time propose that the parties arbitrate their differences a strike could occur 30 days thereafter if the parties did not accept arbitration however if arbitration is rejected by either party the president of the united states of america could then appoint an emergency board which would delay any strike for a further 60 days while the board made recommendations and the parties engaged in further negotiations the outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at this point 

market risks and hedging activities 

ns has used derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

in 2001 ns began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption the intent of the program was to assist in the management of ns aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations which can significantly affect ns operating margins and profitability through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments no new hedges have been entered into since may of 2004 and the last remaining contracts were settled in the second quarter of 2006 bringing an end to the benefits from the program diesel fuel costs represented 14 of ns operating expenses for 2006 11 for 2005 and 8 for 2004 

ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments and by entering into interestrate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio 

at dec 31 2006 ns debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 237 million a 1 point increase in interest rates would increase ns total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately 2 million management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

some of ns capital leases which carry an average fixed rate of 7 were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements on dec 31 2006 the average pay rate under these agreements was 6 and the average receive rate was 7 during 2006 and 2005 the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by 1 million and 2 million respectively  a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yendenominated obligation most of these deposits are held by foreign banks primarily japanese as a result ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan  counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” this interpretation clarifies accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return under the guidelines of fin 48 an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination ns will adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of 2007 and expects it will not have a material effect on ns’ consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” this statement requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation employers must also recognize as a component of other comprehensive income net of tax the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs credits and transition costs that arise during the period ns adopted this statement in the fourth quarter of 2006 see note 10 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” this statement establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services such as stockbased compensation plans ns adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2006 see note 1 

inflation 

in preparing financial statements us generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property ns a capitalintensive company has most of its capital invested in such assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

proposed legislation and regulations on safety and transportation of hazardous materials 

regulations proposed by the department of homeland security in late 2006 would mandate that railroads adopt chain of custody and security measures if enacted such regulations could cause service degradation and higher costs for the transportation of toxic inhalation hazard materials in addition certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders some legislators have contemplated prenotification requirements for hazardous material shipments if promulgated such ordinances could require the rerouting of hazardous materials shipments with the potential for significant additional costs and network inefficiencies accordingly ns will oppose efforts to impose unwarranted regulation in this area

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

norfolk southern’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer with the assistance of management evaluated the effectiveness of ns disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a‑15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of dec 31 2006 based on such evaluation such officers have concluded that as of dec 31 2006 ns disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in ns’ reports under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within time period specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

internal control over financial reporting 

the management of norfolk southern is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to its ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time

in order to ensure that the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of dec 31 2006 this assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  based on our assessment management has concluded that the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of dec 31 2006 

the board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of the corporations accounting policies financial reporting and internal control the audit committee of the board of directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee

norfolk southern’s management has issued a report of its assessment of internal control over financial reporting and norfolk southern’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on this assessment these reports appear in part ii item 8 of this report on form 10k

during the fourth quarter of 2006 management has not identified any changes in ns internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect ns’ internal control over financial reporting

see the discussion of intermodal traffic in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations” 

freight rates  in 2004 ns railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms thus a major portion of ns railroads freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government in general market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices however in 2004 there were significant coal movements moving under common carrier tariff rates that had previously moved under rates contained in transportation contracts beginning jan 1 2002 coal moving to duke energys duke belews creek allen buck and dan river generating stations moved under common carrier rates and beginning april 1 2002 coal moving to carolina power and lights cpl hyco and mayo plants moved under common carrier rates in 2002 duke and cpl filed rate reasonableness complaints at the stb alleging that ns’ tariff rates for the transportation of coal were unreasonable on october 20 2004  in a consolidated decision the stb found ns’ rates to be reasonable in both cases at the stb’s invitation duke and cpl have each initiated proceedings to determine whether phasing constraints should apply although management has made an estimate of the ultimate resolution of these cases the uncertainty of future developments in the duke case and or the cpl case may result in adjustments that could have a favorable or unfavorable material impact on results of operations in a particular quarter or year see the discussion of the rate cases in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

in 2004 ns railroads were found by the stb not to be “revenue adequate” based on results for the year 2003 a railroad is “revenue adequate” under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industrys composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement and does not adversely impact ns liquidity or capital resources

noncarrier operations  ns noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition leasing and management of coal oil gas and minerals the development of commercial real estate telecommunications and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment in 2004 no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 131 

railway property 

the ns railroad system extends across 22 states the district of columbia and portions of canada  the railroad infrastructure makes the company very capital intensive with total property of approximately 21 billion

equipment  as of dec 31 2004  ns owned or leased the following units of equipment 

 

the following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at dec 31 2004  

 

 fifty of the locomotives built in 2001 were purchased in 2002

as of dec 31 2004  the average age of the locomotive fleet was 168 years during 2004 50 locomotives the average age of which was 229 years were retired the average age of the freight car fleet at dec 31 2004  was 276 years between 1988 and 2000 about 29000 coal cars were rebodied  as a result the remaining servicibility of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the high percentage of freight cars built in earlier years during 2004 1829 freight cars were retired 

 

ongoing freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety reliability customer satisfaction and equipment marketability the freight car bad order ratio rose in 2000 2001 and 2002 as a result of decreased maintenance activity the decline in 2003 reflected an increase in maintenance activity as well as the retirement of unserviceable units the locomotive bad order ratio includes units out of service for required inspections every 92 days and program work such as overhauls the elevated ratio through 2004 reflected units out of service related to the resumption of maintenance and modification activities 

encumbrances  certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to approximately 930 million as of dec 31 2004  and 910 million at dec 31 2003  

track maintenance  of the approximately 38200 total miles of track operated ns had responsibility for maintaining about 31000 miles of track with the remainder being operated under trackage rights over 75 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 141 pounds per yard approximately 40 of ns lines carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile 

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding ns track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years 

 

microwave system  the ns microwave system consisting of approximately 7400 radio route miles 423 core stations 14 secondary stations and 5 passive repeater stations provides communications between most operating locations the microwave system is used primarily for voice communications vhf radio control circuits data and facsimile transmissions traffic control operations and aei data transmissions

traffic control  of the approximately 16400 route miles owned by ns 11052 miles are signalized including 8030 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 3022 miles of automatic block signals 

k9 

of the 8030 miles of ctc 2565 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 197 base station radio sites 

computers  a computer network consisting of a centralized data center in atlanta  georgia  and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards terminals transportation offices rolling stock repair points sales offices and other key system locations operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data in addition the computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and services including payroll car and revenue accounting billing material management activities and controls and special studies 

environmental matters  compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal ns goal to date such compliance has not affected materially ns capital additions earnings liquidity or competitive position see the discussion of “environmental matters” in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees  ns employed an average of 28475 employees in 2004 compared with an average of 28753 employees in 2003 the approximate average cost per employee during 2004 was 59000 in wages and 28000 in employee benefits 

approximately 85 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 14 different labor unions see the discussion of “labor agreements” in part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

government regulation  in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses ns railroads are subject to regulation by the stb the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers the department of transportation regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards 

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads begun over two decades ago under the staggers rail act of 1980 has continued significant exemptions are tofccofc ie “piggyback” business rail boxcar traffic lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing transportation contracts on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well about 75 of ns freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts 

efforts may be made in 2005 to resubject the rail industry to unwarranted federal economic regulation the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially reduced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly ns will oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation 

competition  there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workin 

k10 

process  users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages 

ns’ primary rail competitor is the csx system both operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory ns also competes with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage 

certain marketing strategies among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the selected financial data 

overview 

ns’ results in 2004 reflect substantial increases in traffic volumes as the us economy recovered and demand for transportation grew the us economy grew an estimated 44 and the manufacturing sector expanded throughout the year the higher demand coupled with the combination of trucking capacity constraints and the continuing fluidity of the ns network resulted in a substantial increase in volume and revenues carloadings were up 603000 units or 9 in 2004 driven by intermodal  metals and construction and coal which together accounted for 95 of this increase and revenues increased 844 million or 13 improved performance and service levels allowed ns to meet increased demand and led to the ability to raise rates in response to market demand the fluidity and efficiency of ns’ system enabled it to handle the record levels of traffic volume and control expenses operating expenses grew less than the 9 increase in carloadings  and the operating ratio a measure of the amount of operating revenues consumed by operating expenses improved to 767 in 2004 

looking ahead ns expects business levels to continue to grow in 2005 but at a more modest pace than seen in 2004 

summarized results of operations 

2004 compared with 2003 

net income was 923 million or 231 per diluted share in 2004 up 388 million or 73 compared with net income of 535 million or 137 per diluted share in 2003 results in 2003 included a 10 million or 3 cents per share gain from discontinued operations see note 17 and a 114 million or 29 cents per share benefit related to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles see note 1 income from continuing operations before accounting changes was 923 million or 231 per diluted share in 2004 compared with 411 million or 105 per diluted share in 2003 the increase in 2004 was the result of higher income from railway operations and also included a 53 million net noncash gain from the conrail corporate reorganization reported in “other income – net” see notes 2 and 3 in addition the comparisons were affected by the costs of a voluntary separation program see note 11 and the impairment of certain telecommunications assets see note 6 which combined to reduce income by 119 million or 30 cents per diluted share in 2003 

2003 compared with 2002 

net income was 535 million or 137 per diluted share in 2003 up 75 million or 16 income from continuing operations before accounting changes was 411 million or 105 per diluted share down 49 million or 11 compared with 2002 reflecting higher compensation and benefits costs which included the costs of the voluntary separation program and lower nonoperating income that reflected the impairment of the telecommunications assets

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

railway operating revenues were 73 billion in 2004 65 billion in 2003 and 63 billion in 2002 the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues volume and average revenue per unit by market group 

 

in 2004 revenues increased 844 million or 13 reflecting a 318 million or 9 rise in general merchandise revenues a 298 million or 24 increase in intermodal revenues and a 228 million or 15 improvement in coal revenues all general merchandise market groups except automotive posted volume increases over 2003 as shown in the following table the revenue improvement was the result of higher traffic volumes and increased average revenues the favorable revenue per unitmix variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit that reflected higher rates and increased fuel surcharges offset in part by the effects of a 17 increase in lowerpriced intermodal traffic volume 

 

in 2003 revenues increased 3 reflecting a 2 rise in general merchandise revenues a 4 improvement in coal revenues and a 5 increase in intermodal revenues all but automotive within the general merchandise market group posted revenue increases over 2002 most of the revenue improvement was the result of higher traffic volumes the favorable revenue per unitmix variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit offset in part by the effects of unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic particularly a 5 increase in intermodal traffic volume 

beginning march 1 2004  ns modified its fuel surcharge program for its merchandise and coal traffic the fuel surcharge program in effect until that time applied a 2 fuel surcharge to line haul freight charges when the west texas intermediate wti crude oil price as published in the wall street journal exceeded 2800 per barrel for 30 consecutive business days for each 500 per barrel increase an 

k18 

additional 2 fuel surcharge applied the revised fuel surcharge is based on the monthly average price of wti crude oil line haul freight charges are adjusted by 04 for every dollar the average price exceeds 23 per barrel in the second calendar month prior to the month in which the fuel surcharge is applied the modification in the fuel surcharge program causes the amount charged to more closely reflect fuel price fluctuations in today’s volatile market higher average wti crude oil prices resulted in an increase in fuel surcharges in 2004 however this was offset by the effect of higher prices for diesel fuel excluding hedge benefits 

coal revenues increased 228 million or 15 versus 2003 traffic volume carloads increased 5 primarily due to higher export utility and metallurgical coal volumes which offset declines in coke and iron ore revenue per unit increased 10 reflecting higher rates fuel surcharges a favorable change in the mix of traffic the rate of increase in longer haul traffic exceeded that of short haul traffic and improved loading productivity increased tons per car coal coke and iron ore revenues represented 24 of total railway operating revenues in 2004 and 83 of ns’ coal shipments originated on lines it operates 

ns is involved in rate cases with two of its utility customers duke energy duke and carolina power  light cpl in 2002 duke and cpl filed rate reasonableness complaints at the stb alleging that ns’ tariff rates for the transportation of coal were unreasonable on oct 20 2004  in a consolidated decision the stb found ns’ rates to be reasonable in both cases at the stb’s invitation duke and cpl each initiated proceedings to determine whether phasing constraints should apply as the stb has explained the phasing constraint is an independent constraint relating not to the reasonableness of a rate but to the reasonableness of collecting it immediately the interstate commerce commission the predecessor to the stb had previously issued guidelines for phasing these guidelines indicate that phasing of a rate increase will only be required where the party seeking such relief demonstrates the need for it with specificity in balancing the equities of the particular phasing request the stb will consider factors including the requirements of the railroads the magnitude of the proposed increase the magnitude of past increases the dependence of the utility on coal the economic conditions in the final destination market and the economic conditions in the coal supply area 

the phasing constraint has never been invoked by a complainant utility in a rate case and the stb has never applied it therefore it is unknown how the stb would balance the above factors whether it would find the phasing constraint applicable and if it did whether phasing would be ordered retroactively or prospectively or both additionally duke and cpl have appealed the october 2004 stb decision on reconsideration to the dc circuit court of appeals although management has made an estimate of the ultimate resolution of these cases due to these uncertainties future developments in the duke case andor the cpl case may result in adjustments that could have a favorable or unfavorable material impact on results of operations in a particular quarter or year over the long term management believes the stb decisions in the duke and cpl proceedings will help support improved pricing for coal transportation services 

coal carloads were flat in 2003 while revenues increased 4 versus 2002 revenue per unit increased 4 reflecting favorable developments in 2003 of the coal rate reasonableness proceedings before the stb as well as increases resulting from more longer haul business and loading productivity improvements that led to more tons per car coal coke and iron ore revenues represented 23 of total railway operating revenues in 2003 and 86 of ns’ coal shipments originated on lines it operates

utility coal volume increased 3 compared to 2003 as electricity production was up almost 2 in ns’ service region responding to higher demand driven by a rebounding us economy utilities increased burn to meet the heavier electricity demand and a new rail unloading facility began operating in april 2004 at a northern utility utility coal stockpiles were below target levels across ns’ service area due in part to the increased demand for coalfired electric generation increased demand for eastern us coal prompted some customers to ship coals from nontraditional coal fields in wyoming and colorado in addition to more imported coal in response appalachian coal production increased slightly in 2004 following declines in 2003 and 2002 

for 2003 utility coal volume increased 1 compared to 2002 primarily due to a 6 gain in tonnage moving to the northeast these gains were led by a full year’s operation of two projects completed in 2002 that captured traffic from truck and barge in the first quarter of 2003 higher natural gas prices and colder temperatures caused coalfired generating stations to run near capacity in the northeast reducing the high stockpiles that were carried forward from 2002 however the mild temperatures through the remainder of the year diminished seasonal demand for coal volumes to utilities in the south decreased 4 due to milder weather and extended power plant outages for the installation of environmental emissioncontrol technology 

the outlook for utility coal remains positive the continued growth in demand for electricity and lowerthantargeted coal stockpiles at the utilities should support increased coal carloads in 2005 domestic western origin and imported coals are expected to continue to be an important source of additional coal supply to overcome the supply imbalance created by increased utility demand and the supply constraints of traditional coal sources natural gas prices are expected to remain higher and more volatile than coal energy prices as always demand will be influenced by the weather 

a number of evolving environmental issues remain that have the potential to affect the utility coal market depending upon their outcome these include a national energy policy proposed multiemissions legislation mercury emissions standards new source review and ongoing efforts at addressing climate change certain utilities have chosen to add emissions control technologies to their electric generating units in advance of governmental requirements and are advancing their plans to more fully utilize their existing coalfired power plants 

export coal volume increased 35 in 2004 compared to 2003 due to sustained strong global demand for high quality metallurgical coal and china ’s continued growing consumption of coal for steel production and electricity generation the devaluation of the dollar resulted in lower us coal prices relative to australian and canadian coal prices which made us coals more economical in traditional european markets in addition ocean vessel rates continued to favor us coals volume through baltimore and norfolk increased dramatically baltimore was up approximately 24000 carloads or 

k20 

159 and norfolk was up approximately 16000 carloads or 16 however us exports in 2004 were constrained by the tight coal supply from eastern coal mines 

export coal volume increased 7 in 2003 compared to 2002 export coal through norfolk  primarily metallurgical coal increased by 24 in 2003 benefiting from a decline in exports from china  strong steel production in china shifted chinese exports of metallurgical coal to its own domestic consumption also ocean freight rates were at an all time high spot vessel rates from australia to europe more than tripled while transatlantic rates increased less dramatically the combination of the gap in ocean freight rates and the shorter sailing times gave the us a competitive advantage in european markets lastly the decline in the value of the dollar against the euro and australian dollar also increased demand for us metallurgical coal abroad coal exported through baltimore  primarily steam coal declined 41 due to strong domestic demand for utility coal 

export coal volume for 2005 is expected to continue to show improvement with strong international demand for metallurgical coal in addition to a weaker dollar and higher shipping costs making us coal more competitive 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore volume was flat in 2004 when compared with 2003 metallurgical coal volume was up 12 however this was offset by declines in domestic coke and iron ore volumes principally due to reduced production at an nsserved producer 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore volumes decreased 6 in 2003 when compared to 2002 due to the temporary closing of a large mine that produced lowvolatile coal the continuing consolidation of the steel industry and fewer blast furnaces operating than in the past 

demand for domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore is expected to improve in 2005 blast furnaces are expected to run near capacity as domestic demand for metallurgical coal continues to grow 

other coal volumes increased 2 versus 2003 primarily due to new business and the recovery of the us economy in 2003 steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants finished the year down 2 when compared to 2002 

general merchandise traffic volume increased 4 in 2004 compared to 2003 and revenues increased 9 principally due to improved volumes in all but the automotive business group higher average revenues across all business groups and increased fuel surcharges in 2003 general merchandise traffic volume increased 1 compared to 2002 and revenues increased 2 principally due to higher average revenues in most business groups and higher agriculture traffic volume 

automotive traffic volume decreased 2 in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to reduced automotive production at ford and gm partially offset by increased production at toyota and honda in contrast revenues increased 2 reflecting pricing improvements and fuel surcharge increases 

in 2003 automotive traffic volume and revenues decreased 3 compared to 2002 principally due to reduced vehicle production 

for 2005 automotive revenues are expected to increase supported by a projected 2 rise in light vehicle production and volume from two plants that opened late in 2004 

chemicals traffic volume increased 5 and revenues increased 12 in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting manufacturers’ increased demand across all chemical business groups feedstocks and plastic shipments were up as inventories were restocked in anticipation of higher product prices related to 

k21 

increased natural gas costs and new propane and asphalt terminals in the southeast added carloads revenue per unit reflected higher prices to meet market conditions and fuel surcharges 

chemicals traffic volume increased 1 and revenue increased 2 in 2003 compared to 2002 traffic volume benefited from higher shipments of industrial intermediates petroleum and environmental products and plastics also contributing to 2003 growth approximately 2000 annual carloads of new traffic were diverted from the waterways and highways revenue per unit reflected improved pricing to meet market conditions as well as favorable changes in mix 

chemical volume is expected to grow in 2005 with several propane and plastic plant expansions planned and the continued strengthening of the economy however volume could be adversely affected by the price of natural gas and crude oil which accounts for more than 50 of the cost of most chemical products and presents a significant competitive challenge that could cause domestic chemical producers to move production overseas 

metals and construction traffic volume increased 10 and revenue increased 17 in 2004 compared with 2003 the improvement was primarily due to increased production at nsserved integrated mills and minimills the conversion of truck business to rail resulting from a shortage of flatbed trucks as well as higher scrap metal volumes resulting from expanded alliances with key scrap metal shippers and access to new scrap processors and steel mills construction traffic volume benefited from increased residential commercial and highway construction 

in 2003 metals and construction traffic volume decreased 1 but revenues increased 1 compared with 2002 the decline in volume resulted from reduced metals volume mostly iron and steel offset in part by higher construction traffic revenue per unit improved 2 reflecting favorable pricing and traffic mix changes 

the outlook for 2005 remains strong for iron and steel markets with new import slab business and growth in plate structural barrod and steel rail for both integrated mills and minimills construction traffic volume is expected to reflect continued strength in residential and commercial construction 

agriculture consumer products and government traffic volume increased 2 and revenue increased 6 in 2004 compared with 2003 driven by ethanol and fertilizer shipments ethanol traffic increased 59 primarily due to the opening of the northeast market to ethanol as a gasoline additive fertilizer was up 7 yearoveryear  reflecting higher domestic shipments to industrial customers and increased exports of phosphates principally to china  revenue per unit improved 3 as a result of changes in traffic mix such as increased ethanol traffic and more long haul feed shipments as well as higher prices 

in 2003 agriculture consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7 and revenues increased 8 compared with 2002 commodities contributing most to these increases were corn fertilizer military sweeteners and wheat only feed food products and beverages showed a slight decrease corn shipments increased 4 in 2003 and revenue was up 8 due to the drought of 2002 which caused a depletion of inventories there was a significant increase in demand for corn to southeast feed mill customers and poultry producers in eastern pennsylvania  maryland  and delaware  resulting in long haul rail movements from midwest suppliers to these areas higher fertilizer traffic resulted from the reopening of a large phosphate fertilizer plant shipments of military vehicles and military equipment increased 36 over 2002 levels due to the war in iraq  

agriculture consumer products and government volume is expected to be higher in 2005 benefiting from the record grain crop in 2004 expanding markets for ethanol and improving feed mill business 

k22 

paper clay and forest products traffic volume increased 1 and revenue increased 8 in 2004 compared with 2003 reflecting yield improvements in all segments except newsprint together with higher printing paper newsprint pulp board and kaolin shipments as us paper production and demand for paper products strengthened in 2004 revenue per unit improved 6 principally as a result of price increases but also aided by increased fuel surcharges 

in 2003 paper clay and forest products traffic increased 1 and revenues increased 5 compared to 2002 principally due to improved domestic demand for paper products paper traffic benefited from increased domestic orders for consumer products packaging and from the advertising sector as well as new business newsprint shipments continued to remain soft largely due to a prolonged decline in demand woodchip volume increased significantly as nsserved paper mills experienced shortages and were forced to source wood fiber from more distant suppliers due to wet weather in the southeast ns clay revenue was up compared to 2002 due to a strong increase in revenue per carload and a more positive mix as ns handled more longhaul domestic traffic lumber business was soft in early 2003 despite strong demand due in part to wet weather and several mill closures lumber business was up in the fourth quarter as weather in the southeast and commodity prices improved 

in 2005 paper clay and forest product revenues are expected to grow modestly with the addition of several new lumber distribution centers on ns lines 

intermodal volume increased 17 and revenue increased 24 in 2004 compared with 2003 strong demand was driven by an expanding economy led by higher consumer spending industrial production and international trade in addition to constraints in truck and other railroads’ capacity international steamship volume was up 15 tied to the growth in us trade volumes through east and west coast ports truckload volume increased 28 as a result of new business with traditional truckload companies premium business which includes parcel and ltl carriers grew 15 principally due to new parcel service between chicago and new jersey  triple crown services company increased volume by 8 through an expanded trailer fleet and growth in its geographic coverage revenue per unit improved 6 reflecting valuebased pricing and fuel surcharges 

in 2003 intermodal volume increased 5 and revenues increased 5 compared to 2002 volume growth was driven by improved service performance that enabled the conversion of truck business to rail shipments for assetbased truckload carriers increased 14 as these trucking companies used intermodal to reduce their exposure to driver shortages and the need for larger fleets international volume which represents 45 of intermodal’s volume grew 9 primarily a result of strong import trade and new business driven by enhanced service triple crown services company’s growth was limited to 1 in 2003 hampered by a fleet at full capacity 

in 2005 intermodal revenues are expected to grow with higher levels of truck to rail conversions as prices for motor carrier services continue to increase as a result of continuing driver and equipment shortages and high fuel prices ns expects to build new terminals in ohio  kentucky  virginia and pennsylvania in addition to expanding existing intermodal terminals strong international trade is expected to create growth opportunities in ns’ international business segment and available capacity should help grow ns’ domestic and premium segments future growth may however be tempered by operating improvements at other railroads as well as constraints in the drayage market 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses increased 4 in 2004 compared to 2003 and 6 in 2003 compared to 2002 expenses in 2003 included 107 million of costs related to a voluntary separation program to reduce the size of the work force while there was no such program in either 2004 or 2002 accordingly the absence 

k23 

of the voluntary separation program in 2004 and 2002 resulted in a 2 reduction in the 2004 to 2003 yearoveryear comparison and a 2 increase in the 2003 to 2002 yearoveryear comparison carloads rose 9 in 2004 compared to 2003 and 2 in 2003 compared to 2002 

the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses was 767 in 2004 compared with 835 in 2003 and 815 in 2002 the voluntary separation costs added 16 percentage points to the 2003 ratio 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

 

 includes 107 million of voluntary separation costs in 2003 

compensation and benefits represented 40 of total railway operating expenses and was flat in 2004 compared to 2003 but increased 13 in 2003 compared to 2002 both comparisons reflect the 107 million costs of the voluntary separation program in 2003 expenses in 2004 reflected higher volumerelated train and engine payroll expenses up 39 million higher wage rates which added 37 million increased stockbased compensation up 24 million and higher management and locomotive engineer performancebased incentive compensation which was up 20 million these increases were offset by lower nonagreement workforce levels saving 24 million as well as the absence of the 107 million expense of the 2003 voluntary separation program 

in the third quarter of 2005 ns will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised which requires expensing of stock options see new accounting pronouncements below and note 1 

almost half of the increase in 2003 was the result of the voluntary separation program the remainder was principally due to higher wage rates including the ble bonus in lieu of wage increases which added 45 million increased health and welfare benefits costs which were up 44 million and reduced pension income down 34 million see note 11 approximately 25 million of the increase in health and welfare benefit costs was attributable to retirees reflecting a higher estimated medical inflation rate 

the railroad retirement and survivors’ improvement act which took effect jan 1 2002 allows for investment of tier ii assets in a diversified portfolio through the national railroad retirement investment trust the law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of tier ii payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a fouryear reserve or exceed a sixyear reserve as a result the employers’ portion 

k24 

of tier ii retirement payroll taxes have been reduced from 142 in 2003 to 131 in 2004 and 126 in 2005 and thereafter however these savings are expected to continue to be substantially offset by higher payroll taxes on increased wages and a higher wage base 

materials services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of railroad lines structures and equipment the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses increased 12 in 2004 compared to 2003 and decreased 2 in 2003 compared to 2002 

the 2004 increase was the result of higher purchased services up 100 million including higher costs for volumerelated intermodal services such as loading of containers and trailers and drayage in addition locomotive and freight car maintenance expenses rose 23 million and equipment rents increased 33 million the 2003 decline reflected lower equipment rents down 26 million and reduced purchased services down 20 million including lower expenses for intermodal  automotive and bulk transfer services and professional and legal fees 

equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment increased 9 in 2004 and decreased 7 in 2003 compared to 2002 the increase in 2004 was principally due to increased volumerelated intermodal shipments and the absence of favorable settlements that benefited 2003 the decline in 2003 was principally the result of lower automotive traffic volume in addition to adjustments relating to periodic studies of equipment rents and favorable settlements of recent bills in addition the change in accounting related to certain leased locomotives see note 1 also reduced equipment rents 

locomotive repair costs increased in 2004 and 2003 due to more maintenance activity related to the increase in business coupled with the age of the fleet locomotive and freight car maintenance costs are expected to increase further in 2005 

conrail rents and services decreased 24 in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased 2 in 2003 compared to 2002 this item includes amounts due to crc for operation of the shared assets areas see note 2 prior to the conrail corporate reorganization this category also included amounts due to prr for use of its operating properties and equipment as well as ns’ equity in conrail’s net earnings and the additional amortization related to the difference between ns’ investment in conrail and its underlying equity see note 2 the decline was primarily driven by the conrail corporate reorganization which resulted in the consolidated reporting of individual components of conrail equity earnings principally depreciation equipment rents and interest expense see note 2 ns’ share of equity earnings postconrail corporate reorganization is now shown within “other incomenet” the increase in 2003 reflects lower conrail earnings and higher expenses in the shared assets areas 

depreciation expense increased 17 in 2004 compared to 2003 and decreased slightly in 2003 compared to 2002 the increase in 2004 was primarily a result of the conrail corporate reorganization see note 2 in addition substantial levels of capital spending affected all years however depreciation expense in 2003 benefited from a change in accounting for the cost to remove crossties see note 1 “properties” for ns depreciation policy 

in 2004 ns received the results of a depreciation study from an independent firm of engineers the results of the study which were implemented in september 2004 prospectively reduced depreciation expense by approximately 17 million annually 

k25 

diesel fuel expenses increased 18 in 2004 compared with 2003 and 11 in 2003 compared to 2002 the increase in 2004 reflects a 13 increase in the average price per gallon which includes hedge benefits and a 6 increase in consumption the increase in 2003 reflects an 11 rise in the average price per gallon including hedge benefits and essentially flat consumption expenses in 2004 included a benefit of 140 million compared with benefits of 59 million in 2003 and 10 million in 2002 from the diesel fuel hedging program see “market risks and hedging activities” below and note 16 ns has hedged approximately 36 of expected 2005 diesel fuel requirements as of december 31 2004  at an average price of 83 cents per gallon no new hedges have been entered into since may 2004 accordingly if diesel fuel prices remain at their current levels or increase further diesel fuel expense will be higher going forward 

recently enacted legislation will repeal the 43 cents per gallon excise tax on railroad diesel fuel and inland waterway fuel by 2007 with the following phased reductions in 2005 and 2006 by 1 cent per gallon from jan 1 2005 through june 30 2005 2 cents per gallon from july 1 2005 through dec 31 2006 and by the full 43 cents thereafter ns consumes approximately 500 million gallons of diesel fuel per year 

casualties and other claims expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters decreased 17 in 2004 compared to 2003 and increased 6 in 2003 compared to 2002 the decline reflected favorable personal injury and freight claims development and higher insurance settlements partially offset by increased derailment expenses the higher expense in 2003 was due to adverse personal injury claims development and derailments expense as well as higher insurance costs 

on jan 6 2005  a derailment occurred in graniteville  sc ns expects the first quarter of 2005 to reflect operating expenses related to this incident of between 30 million and 40 million pretax the amount includes ns’ selfinsured retention under its insurance policies as well as other uninsured costs although potential losses may exceed selfinsured retention amounts ns expects at this time that insurance coverage is adequate to cover such potential claims or settlements this amount does not include any fines or penalties that could be imposed 

the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs in 2004 cases involving occupational injuries comprised about onethird of total employee injury cases resolved and 24 of the total payments made with its longestablished commitment to safety ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs with respect to occupational injuries which are not caused by a specific accident or event but result from a claimed exposure over time the benefits of any existing safety initiatives may not be realized immediately these types of claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of which have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades 

the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased system which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers compensation system 

ns maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims it also retains reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance see note 18 ns expects insurance costs to be higher in 2005 

other expenses increased 5 in 2004 compared to 2003 and 8 in 2003 compared to 2002 the increase in 2004 reflected higher property and sales and use taxes the increase in 2003 was primarily 

k26 

attributable to higher state franchise and sales and use taxes the absence of a favorable bad debt settlement that benefited 2002 and higher union employee travel expenses 

other income – net was 89 million in 2004 19 million in 2003 and 66 million in 2002 see note 3 the increase in 2004 reflected the absence of the 84 million telecommunications assets impairment charge that burdened 2003 see note 6 and the gain in 2004 recognized on the conrail corporate reorganization see note 2 that combined to more than offset losses generated by an investment in a limited liability company that owns and operates facilities that produce synthetic fuel from coal see the discussion of tax credit investments below the decline in 2003 was primarily due to the 84 million charge that offset increased gains from the sale of properties higher corporateowned life insurance returns and lower interest accruals related to tax liabilities 

in june 2004 ns purchased a membership interest in a limited liability company that owns and operates facilities that produce synthetic fuel from coal the production of synthetic fuel results in expenses related to the investments as well as tax credits the expenses are recorded as a component of “other income – net” and the tax credits as well as tax benefits related to the expenses are reflected in the provision for income taxes the synthetic fuel tax credits are subject to reduction if the average price of oil for a year exceeds a certain amount under the tax laws given current market conditions it is possible that these tax credits could be reduced in 2005 such a reduction in tax credits would be accompanied by a reduction in the expense related to the investment although the net effect would be to reduce the projected return on the investment 

income taxes 

income tax expense in 2004 was 379 million for an effective rate of 29 compared with effective rates of 30 in 2003 and 35 in 2002 excluding ns’ equity in conrail’s aftertax earnings and the gain on the conrail corporate reorganization the effective rate was 31 in 2004 33 in 2003 and 38 in 2002 

in 2004 the effective rate was reduced by tax credits from synthetic fuel related investments and the favorable resolution of an irs audit of a synthetic fuel related investment see note 4 in 2003 the effective rate was reduced by the favorable resolution of prior years’ tax audits the effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities 

for the last four years 30 and 50 bonus depreciation has been allowed for federal income tax purposes after 2004 bonus depreciation will not be available in addition the conrail corporate reorganization resulted in ns receiving assets with less future tax depreciation than book depreciation as a result current taxes have been lower in prior years than might be expected in future years 

ns has interests in synthetic fuel related investments that result in tax credits these synthetic fuel tax credits expire at the end of 2007 in addition synthetic fuel tax credits are subject to reduction if the average price of oil for a year exceeds a certain amount under the tax laws given current market conditions it is possible that these tax credits could be reduced in 2005 

discontinued operations 

in 2003 income from discontinued operations consisted of a 10 million aftertax gain related to the resolution of tax issues arising from the sale of ns’ motor carrier subsidiary

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities ns principal source of liquidity was 1661 million in 2004 compared with 1054 million in 2003 and 803 million in 2002 the improvement in 2004 was primarily due to increased railway operating income in 2003 the increase reflected a smaller change in the amount of accounts receivables sold declines in receivables sold amounted to 30 million in 2003 and 270 million in 2002 see note 5 

prior to the conrail corporate reorganization a significant portion of payments made to prr which were included in “conrail rents and services” and therefore were a use of cash in “cash provided by operating activities” was borrowed back from a prr subsidiary under a note due in 2032 and therefore was a source of cash in “proceeds from borrowings” amounts outstanding under this note comprised the longterm balance of “due to conrail” and this note was effectively extinguished by the conrail corporate reorganization subsequent to the conrail corporate reorganization payments under “conrail rents and services” have declined depreciation charges have increased and the net borrowings have been terminated accordingly ns’ cash provided by operating activities after the conrail corporate reorganization has increased ns net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to 118 million in 2004 203 million in 2003 and 212 million in 2002 

ns working capital deficit was 234 million at dec 31 2004  compared with 376 million at dec 31 2003  the improvement was principally due to an increase in cash flow from operations 

ns expects that cash on hand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations including the higher level of debt maturing in 2005 this expectation is based on a view that the economy will continue at a moderate growth rate through 2005 

contractual obligations at dec 31 2004 related to ns longterm debt including capital leases see note 8 operating leases see note 9 agreements with crc see note 2 unconditional purchase obligations see note 18 and other longterm obligations see note 18 are as follows 

 

off balance sheet arrangements consist of an accounts receivable sale program see note 5 while there were some sales during 2004 there were no accounts receivable sold under this arrangement as of dec 31 2004  ns does not expect to sell any accounts receivable in 2005 

cash used for investing activities increased 77 in 2004 and decreased 5 in 2003 property additions which account for most of the recurring spending in this category were up 45 in 2004 and up 4 in 2003 in addition investing activities reflect ns’ new investment in a membership interest in a limited 

k28 

liability company that owns and operates facilities that produce synthetic fuel from coal the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 

 

higher capital expenditures in 2004 were primarily due to increased locomotive purchases and investment in roadway projects in addition to triple crown services company equipment and freight cars the increase in 2003 reflects higher locomotive purchases offset in part by lower spending on signal and electrical projects and computers 

ns and six other railroads five class i railroads and a commuter railroad have agreed to participate in the chicago region environmental and transportation efficiency create project in chicago  the intent of the proposed publicprivate partnership is to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity in the metropolitan chicago area the project is estimated to cost 15 billion with city state and federal support the railroads’ financial contribution to the project is contingent upon a binding commitment that establishes the availability on terms and conditions satisfactory to the railroads of all required public funding and of thirdparty properties necessary to complete the entire project if public funding is secured the railroads will contribute a total of 232 million towards the project with ns’ share slated to be 34 million over an estimated six‑year period 

 

 

through its coal car rebody program which was suspended in 2000 ns converted about 29000 hopper cars into highcapacity steel gondolas or hoppers as a result the remaining service life of the freightcar fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above 

k29 

for 2005 ns has budgeted 938 million for capital expenditures the anticipated spending includes 671 million for roadway projects of which 438 million is for track and bridge program work also included are projects for communications signal and electrical systems as well as projects for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations and signal upgrades other roadway projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives including increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution facilities and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure equipment spending of 225 million includes the purchase of 52 locomotives and upgrades to existing units improvements to multilevel automobile racks and projects related to computers and information technology including additional security and backup systems 

cash used for financing activities was 233 million in 2004 314 million in 2003 and 150 million in 2002 the change in 2004 reflected more proceeds from common stock issued in connection with employee option exercises as well as the elimination of prr borrowings that resulted from the conrail corporate reorganization the increase in 2003 primarily resulted from a higher net reduction in debt and the 43 million redemption in 2003 of all publicly held shares of norfolk southern railway’s preferred stock prior to the conrail corporate reorganization financing activities included loan transactions with a subsidiary of prr that were net borrowings of 118 million in 2004 203 million in 2003 and 212 million in 2002 see note 2 debt was reduced 371 million in 2004 compared with a decrease of 370 million in 2003 and 303 million in 2002 ns’ debttototal capitalization ratio at year end was 485 in 2004 and 507 excluding notes payable to the prr subsidiary in 2003 

ns currently has in place and available a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants additionally ns has the ability to issue up to 1 billion of registered debt or equity securities under its shelf registration statement on form s3 which was filed in september 2004 see note 8

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require management to change them accordingly management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances management discusses the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market 

k30 

performance  management engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 

ns net pension benefit which is included in “compensation and benefits” on its consolidated income statement was 36 million for the year ended dec 31 2004  in recording this amount ns assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 9 investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10 15 and 20year periods has been in excess of 10 a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 18 million change to the pension credit and as a result an equal change in “compensation and benefits” expense changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future the net pension asset is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment therefore management has little discretion in this assumption 

ns net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was 49 million for the year ended dec 31 2004  in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits which is included in “other benefits” as disclosed in note 11 management estimated future increases in healthcare costs these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note 11 

properties and depreciation 

most of ns total assets are comprised of longlived railway properties see note 6 as disclosed in note 1 ns properties are depreciated using group depreciation rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by grosston miles other properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value 

ns depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement these assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation studies that are performed by a firm of consulting engineers these studies analyze ns historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices ns recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense the studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property ns “depreciation expense” for the year ended dec 31 2004  amounted to 598 million ns weightedaverage depreciation rates for 2004 are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would have resulted in a 27 million increase or decrease to ns depreciation expense 

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

ns expense for “casualties and other claims” amounted to 151 million for the year ended dec 31 2004  most of this expense was composed of ns accrual related to personal injury liabilities see discussion of fela in the discussion captioned “casualties and other claims” above jobrelated personal injury and occupational claims are subject to fela which is applicable only to railroads fela’s faultbased tort system produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with 

k31 

a nofault worker’s compensation system the variability inherent in this system could result in actual costs being very different from the liability recorded in all cases ns records a liability when the expected loss for the claim is both probable and estimable 

ns engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year for employee personal injury cases the actuarial firm studies ns historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements taking into account relevant outside influences an estimate of the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims is based on the results of this analysis for occupational injury claims the actuarial firm studies ns’ history of claim filings severity payments and other relevant facts additionally the estimate of the ultimate loss for occupational injuries includes a provision for those claims that have been incurred but not reported by projecting ns’ experience into the future as far as can be reasonably determined ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which ns would recognize when such a change became known the most recent actuarial study was performed as of sept 30 2004  and resulted in a slight decrease to ns personal injury liability during the fourth quarter while the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study it is reasonably possible that the liability could be higher or lower 

ns is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations it is ns policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 18 environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy 

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately 11 million in 2004 9 million in 2003 and 15 million in 2002 and capital expenditures totaled approximately 9 million in 2004 and in 2003 and 10 million in 2002 capital expenditures in 2005 are expected to be comparable to those in 2004 

ns balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of 64 million at dec 31 2004  and 25 million at dec 31 2003 of which 12 million was accounted for as a current liability at dec 31 2004  and 8 million at dec 31 2003  the increase in the liability was the result of the conrail corporate reorganization and relates to sites on the former prr properties at dec 31 2004  the liability represented ns estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 210 identified locations on that date 15 sites accounted for 32 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period 

at some of the 210 locations certain ns subsidiaries usually in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statutes which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs 

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss 

k32 

 and that participants ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities 

the risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the railroad business some of the commodities in ns traffic mix particularly those classified as hazardous materials can pose special risks that ns and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize in addition several ns subsidiaries own or have owned land used as operating property or which is leased and operated by others or held for sale because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed there can be no assurance that ns will not incur environmentally related liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time moreover lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

however based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the corporation is aware further management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to expenses while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments in managements opinion the recorded liability if any is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

income taxes 

ns net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 6550 million at dec 31 2004 see note 4 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized ns has a 21 million valuation allowance on 668 million of deferred tax assets as of dec 31 2004  reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized in addition ns has a recorded liability for its estimate of potential income tax exposures management believes this liability for potential exposure to be adequate income tax expense is adjusted to the extent the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded for every one half percent change in the 2004 effective rate net income would have changed by 7 million 

k33 

other matters 

labor agreements 

approximately 24000 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act ns largely bargains in concert with other major railroads moratorium provisions in the labor agreements govern when the railroads and the unions may propose labor agreement changes such proposals were made in late 1999 and since that time ns has reached agreements with most of the major rail labor organizations to settle that round of bargaining these agreements cover approximately 93 of ns contract employees tentative agreements subject to ratification have also been reached with the national conference of firemen and oilers and the sheet metal workers international association a 1999 bargaining round agreement has not yet been reached with the international association of machinists on or after november 1 2004  the railroads and the rail labor unions served new proposals to begin the next bargaining round the outcome of the negotiations cannot be determined at this point 

market risks and hedging activities 

ns uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

in 2001 ns began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption the intent of the program is to assist in the management of ns aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations which can significantly affect ns operating margins and profitability through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments 

diesel fuel costs represented 8 of ns operating expenses for 2004 the program provides that ns will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months and that no more than 80 of ns average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for any month within any 36month period 

as of dec 31 2004  through swap transactions ns has hedged approximately 36 of expected 2005 diesel fuel requirements the effect of these hedges is to yield an average cost of 83 cents per hedged gallon including federal taxes and transportation a 10 decrease in diesel fuel prices would reduce ns asset related to the swaps by approximately 24 million as of dec 31 2004  

however with fuel prices near historic highs and fuel surcharges being collected under certain tariffs and contracts ns has not entered into additional hedges since may 2004 consequently the past pattern of entering into regular monthly swaps may not be indicative of future hedging activity if diesel fuel prices remain at their current levels or increase further diesel fuel expense will be higher going forward 

ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments and by entering into interestrate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio 

at dec 31 2004  ns debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 576 million a 1 increase in interest rates would increase ns total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately 6 million management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

k34 

some of ns capital leases which carry an average fixed rate of 7 were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements on dec 31 2004  the average pay rate under these agreements was 3 and the average receive rate was 7 during 2004 the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by 6 million a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yendenominated obligation most of these deposits are held by foreign banks primarily japanese as a result ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan  counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy 

new accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised sharebased payment this statement effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june 15 2005  establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services such as stockbased compensation plans the statement applies to all awards granted after the effective date and to awards modified repurchased or cancelled after that date as the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods will depend on the levels of future grants the effect of adoption of this statement cannot be predicted with certainty however had ns adopted this statement in prior periods the effect of adoption on net income and earnings per share would have approximated the amounts shown in the pro forma information included in note 1 

proposed legislation and regulations on safety and transportation of hazardous materials 

legislation introduced in congress in early 2005 would give federal regulators increased authority to conduct investigations and levy substantial fines and penalties in connection with railroad accidents federal regulators would also be required to prescribe new regulations governing railroads transportation of hazardous materials if enacted such legislation and regulations could impose significant additional costs on railroads including ns in addition certain local governments have sought to enact ordinances banning or requiring disclosures with respect to hazardous materials moving by rail within their borders if promulgated and upheld such ordinances could require the rerouting of hazardous materials shipments with the potential for significant additional costs and network inefficiencies 

inflation 

in preparing financial statements us generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property ns a capitalintensive company has most of its capital invested in such assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

forwardlooking statements 

this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements that may be identified by the use of words like “believe” “expect” “anticipate” and “project” forwardlooking statements reflect managements goodfaith evaluation of information currently available however such statements are dependent on and therefore can be influenced by a number of external variables over which management has little or no control including domestic and international economic conditions the business environment in industries that produce and 

k35 

consume rail freight competition and consolidation within the transportation industry fluctuation in prices of key materials in particular diesel fuel labor difficulties including strikes and work stoppages legislative and regulatory developments changes in securities and capital markets and natural events such as severe weather floods and earthquakes forwardlooking statements are not and should not be relied upon as a guaranty of future performance or results nor will they necessarily prove to be accurate indications of the times at or by which any such performance or results will be achieved as a result actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements ns undertakes no obligation to update or revise forwardlooking statements

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

norfolk southern’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of ns disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of december 31 2004 based on such evaluation such officers have concluded that as of december 31 2004  ns disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them on a timely basis to material information relating to ns including its consolidated subsidiaries required to be included in ns periodic filings under the exchange act

internal control over financial reporting 

the management of norfolk southern is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the corporation’s ability to record process summarize and report reliable financial data management recognizes that there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of internal control accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation further because of changes in conditions the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time

in order to ensure that the corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective management regularly assesses such controls and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of december 31 2004  this assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework  based on our assessment management has concluded that the corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 

the board of directors acting through its audit committee is responsible for the oversight of the corporations accounting policies financial reporting and internal control the audit committee of the board of directors is comprised entirely of outside directors who are independent of management the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and unlimited access to the audit committee with or without management to discuss the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be brought to the attention of the audit committee

norfolk southern’s management has issued a report of its assessment of internal control over financial reporting and norfolk southern’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on this assessment these reports appear in item ii part 8 of this report on form 10k

during the fourth quarter of 2004 management has not identified any changes in ns internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect ns’ internal controls over financial reporting

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the fiveyear financial review 

summarized results of operations 

2003 compared with 2002 

net income was 535 million or 137 per diluted share in 2003 up 75 million or 16 results in 2003 included a 10 million or 3 cents per share gain from discontinued operations see note 17 and a 114 million or 29 cents per share benefit related to the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles see note 1 income from continuing operations before accounting changes which excludes these items was 411 million or 105 per diluted share down 49 million or 11 compared with 2002 reflecting higher compensation and benefits costs which included the costs of a voluntary separation program see note 11 and lower nonoperating income that reflected the impairment of certain telecommunications assets see note 6 the costs of the voluntary separation program and the asset impairment combined to reduce income by 119 million or 30 cents per share 

2002 compared with 2001 

net income was 460 million or 118 per diluted share in 2002 up 85 million or 23 net income in 2001 was 375 million and included a 13 million or 3 cents per share gain from discontinued operations see note 17 accordingly income from continuing operations was 362 million or 94 cents per diluted share results in 2002 were 98 million or 27 above 2001’s income from continuing operations the improvement was primarily the result of a 151 million or 15 increase in income from railway operations 

detailed results of operations 

railway operating revenues 

railway operating revenues were 65 billion in 2003 63 billion in 2002 and 62 billion in 2001 the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues by market group prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current market groupings 

k19 

 

in 2003 revenues increased 3 reflecting a 2 rise in general merchandise revenues a 4 improvement in coal revenues and a 5 increase in intermodal revenues all but automotive within the general merchandise market group posted increases over 2002 as shown in the following table most of the revenue improvement was the result of higher traffic volumes the favorable revenue per unitmix variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit offset in part by the effects of unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic particularly a 5 increase in lowerpriced intermodal traffic volume 

 

in 2002 revenues increased 2 as a 3 rise in general merchandise revenues coupled with a 5 improvement in intermodal revenues offset a 5 decline in coal revenues all but one of the general merchandise market groups paper clay and forest products posted increases over 2001 

beginning march 1 2004 ns will modify its fuel surcharge program for its merchandise and coal traffic the fuel surcharge program in effect until that time applies a 2 fuel surcharge to line haul freight charges when the wti crude oil price as published in the wall street journal exceeds 2800 per barrel for 30 consecutive business days for each 500 per barrel increase an additional 2 fuel surcharge applies the revised fuel surcharge will be based on the monthly average price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil line haul freight charges will be adjusted by 04 for every dollar the average price exceeds 23 per barrel in the second calendar month prior to the month in which the fuel surcharge is applied the modification in the fuel surcharge program will cause the amount charged to more closely reflect fuel price fluctuations in today’s volatile market 

coal tonnage increased 1 in 2003 and revenues increased 4 versus 2002 revenue per unit increased 4 reflecting favorable developments in the coal rate reasonableness proceedings before the stb as discussed below as well as increases resulting from more longer haul business and loading 

k20 

productivity improvements that led to more tons per car coal coke and iron ore revenues represented 23 of total railway operating revenues in 2003 and 86 of ns coal shipments originated on lines it operates 

in 2002 two of ns’ utility customers duke energy duke and carolina power  light cpl filed rate reasonableness complaints at the stb alleging that ns’ tariff rates for the transportation of coal were unreasonable in the duke proceeding the stb initially found ns’ rates to be reasonable in november 2003 but subsequently issued technical corrections in february 2004 finding that in certain years some portion of the rates was unreasonable the case is currently stayed because both parties have indicated that they intend to file petitions for reconsideration and the stb has not yet ordered any rate relief in the cpl proceeding the stb found ns’ rates to be unreasonable in december 2003 but upheld a significant portion of ns’ tariff increase both of the stb’s rate decisions remain subject to petitions for rehearing and appeals future developments in the two cases could result in additional adjustments and could have a significant impact on results of operations in a particular quarter over the long term management believes the stb decisions in the duke and cpl proceedings will help support improved pricing for coal transportation services 

in 2002 coal tonnage decreased 4 and revenues declined 5 revenue per unit declined slightly reflecting unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic more shorterhaul business that offset the effects of rate increases and gains in tonnage per car 

 

utility coal tonnage increased 2 compared to 2002 primarily due to a 6 gain in tonnage moving to the northeast these gains were led by a full year’s operation of two projects completed in 2002 that captured traffic from truck and barge 

in the first quarter of 2003 higher natural gas prices and colder temperatures caused coalfired generating stations to run at near capacity in the northeast reducing the high stockpiles that were carried forward from 2002 however the mild temperatures through the remainder of the year diminished seasonal demand for coal volumes to utilities in the south decreased 4 due to milder weather and extended power plant outages for the installation of environmental emissioncontrol technology 

in 2002 utility coal tonnage decreased 3 a result of lower demand that reflected the weak economy high coal stockpile levels entering the year mild temperatures in the first quarter reduced stockpile targets set by utility companies and increased generation from new natural gasfired plants licensing requirements for these new plants resulted in additional generation that temporarily displaced coalfired generation 

the outlook for utility coal remains positive coalfired generation continues to be the lowestcost source for electric generation that has additional growth capacity above current levels management expects

utilities to use coalfired plants to meet increased electricity demand because of coal’s low generating cost and the strengthening economy as always demand will be influenced by the weather 

there remain a number of evolving environmental issues that have the potential to increase or ease cost pressures on the utility coal market depending upon their outcome these include a new national energy policy proposed multiemissions legislation mercury emissions standard new source review and the fate of the united states participation in the kyoto protocol although developments with these environmental issues could potentially increase cost pressures on coalfired generation the outlook remains positive for maintaining coal’s position in the power generation mix for regions served by ns favorable developments with these issues could actually ease cost pressures on coalfired generation further strengthening coal’s position 

export coal tonnage increased 9 in 2003 compared to 2002 export coal through norfolk primarily metallurgical coal increased by 24 in 2003 benefiting from a decline in exports from china strong steel production in china increased demand for metallurgical coal and coke and shifted chinese exports of these commodities to domestic consumption also ocean freight rates are at an all time high spot vessel rates from australia to europe have more than tripled while transatlantic rates have increased less dramatically the combination of the resulting gap in ocean freight rates and the shorter sailing times has given the united states a competitive advantage in european markets last the decline in the value of the dollar against the euro and australian dollar also increased demand for united states metallurgical coal abroad coal exported through baltimore primarily steam coal declined 41 due to strong domestic demand for utility coal as discussed above 

in 2002 export coal tonnage declined 18 compared to 2001 steam coal exports through baltimore declined 4 and export metallurgical coals through norfolk declined 22 during the first half of 2002 demand for us coal was soft as international buyers focused their purchases toward other lowerpriced sources market uncertainty resulted in late contract settlements and delayed shipments late in 2002 demand for us coking coals increased reflecting a shift in the market as exports from china australia and poland declined as a result shipments through norfolk increased in the fourth quarter of 2002 

strong domestic steam coal prices and reduced metallurgical coal production have limited export growth in the united states the stage is set for further recovery in export volumes in 2004 export growth will depend however upon the availability of coal supply from key metallurgical mines on ns pricing is also expected to strengthen 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore volumes decreased 5 in 2003 when compared to 2002 due to the temporary closing of a large mine that produced lowvolatile coal the continuing consolidation of the steel industry and fewer blast furnaces operating than in the past 

in 2002 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage increased 5 reflecting higher us steel production aided by the imported steel tariff program implemented in 2002 in addition continued strong vehicle production resulted in demand for steel 

future demand for domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore is uncertain but may increase in 2004 due to the shortage that exists in the world market continuation of the anticipated rationalization of the steel industry is expected resulting in fewer blast furnaces in operation however the furnaces that remain are expected to run near capacity growth may be limited by the availability of coal supply from a key metallurgical mine on ns that was idled in 2003 but is expected to reopen sometime in the second half of 2004 in addition the end of the steel tariff in december 2003 could mean lower steel prices worldwide and may lead to further consolidations in the industry 

k22 

other coal volumes principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants finished the year down 1 when compared to 2002 in 2002 other coal traffic decreased 14 a result of the weak economy 

general merchandise traffic volume carloads increased 1 in 2003 and revenues increased 2 principally due to higher average revenues in most business groups and higher agriculture traffic volume in 2002 traffic volume increased 2 and revenues increased 3 reflecting a 9 improvement in automotive revenues 

automotive traffic volume and revenues decreased 3 in 2003 principally due to reduced vehicle production 

in 2002 automotive traffic volume increased 7 and revenues increased 9 principally due to a rise in vehicle production and new business revenue per unit increased 2 reflecting some pricing improvements extended length of haul special ancillary services and the settlement of a disputed charge 

automotive revenues in 2004 are expected to be somewhat higher than those of 2003 due to several factors light vehicle production is predicted to be slightly above the 2003 level ns has increased rail service to a major customer with a second plant opening towards the end of 2004 and the addition of several new products 

chemicals traffic volume increased 1 and revenue increased 2 compared to 2002 traffic volume benefited from higher shipments of industrial intermediates petroleum and environmental products and plastics also contributing to 2003 growth approximately 2000 annual carloads of new traffic were diverted from the waterways and highways revenue per unit reflected improved pricing to meet market conditions as well as favorable changes in mix 

in 2002 chemicals traffic volume increased slightly and revenues increased 2 higher traffic volume for plastics and a small increase for miscellaneous chemicals offset a decline for petroleum products demand for plastics was supported by increases in light vehicle production and housing starts traffic volume also benefited from increased shipments through ns thoroughbred bulk transfer tbt facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on nsserved lines revenue per unit increased as a result of a favorable change in the mix of traffic more higherrated business and marketdriven rate increases 

chemical volume is expected to improve in 2004 primarily due to expectations for a stronger economy and growth from new or expanded plastics plants however volume could be adversely affected by the price of energy in north america particularly that of natural gas and crude oil both of these commodities account for more than 50 of the cost of most chemical products and high north american prices are causing chemical producers increasingly to look off shore for production 

metals and construction traffic volume decreased 1 but revenues increased 1 in 2003 compared with 2002 the decline in volume resulted from reduced metals volume mostly iron and steel offset in part by higher construction traffic revenue per unit improved 2 reflecting favorable pricing and traffic mix changes 

in 2002 metals and construction traffic volume increased 2 and revenues improved 3 reflecting improvement in the steel industry aided by the twoyear imported steel tariff program metals volume benefited from resumption of production at some mills that closed in 2001 and increased volume from new mills construction traffic declined primarily as a result of reductions in highway projects due to state government budget pressures 

k23 

metals and construction revenues in 2004 are expected to benefit from an improved economic environment and converting motor carrier traffic to rail although further consolidation in the steel industry is expected new stone terminals on ns lines in florida georgia and tennessee will generate additional aggregate business and new access to existing cement facilities will increase traffic 

agriculture consumer products and government traffic volume increased 7 and revenues increased 8 compared with 2002 commodities contributing most to these increases were corn fertilizer military sweeteners and wheat only feed food products and beverages showed a slight decrease corn shipments increased 4 in 2003 and revenue was up 8 due to the drought of 2002 which caused a depletion of inventories there was a significant increase in demand for corn to southeast feed mill customers and poultry producers in eastern pennsylvania maryland and delaware resulting in long haul rail movements from midwest suppliers to these areas higher fertilizer traffic resulted from the reopening of a large phosphate fertilizer plant shipments of military vehicles and military equipment increased 36 over 2002 levels due to the war in iraq 

in 2002 agriculture consumer products and government traffic volume decreased slightly compared to 2001 but revenues increased 3 traffic volume increases for corn food products and beverages largely offset declines for soybeans and feed corn volume benefited from increased shipments from the midwest to droughtstricken areas in the east the increase for food products was primarily the result of new business soybean and feed volumes were adversely affected by lower domestic and export demand revenue per unit increased because of higher rates increased length of haul and favorable changes in the mix of traffic 

agriculture consumer products and government revenues in 2004 are expected to remain steady reflecting a more normalized 2003 crop and the overall strong performance of the other commodities traffic levels should benefit from new southeastern feed mills that are expected to come on line by late 2004 as well as more shipments of corn ethanol and transcontinental shipments of fresh and frozen foods 

paper clay and forest products traffic increased 1 and revenues increased 5 compared to 2002 principally due to improved domestic demand for paper products paper traffic benefited from increased domestic orders for consumer products packaging and from the advertising sector as well as new business newsprint shipments continued to remain soft largely due to a prolonged decline in demand woodchip volume increased significantly as nsserved paper mills experienced shortages and were forced to source wood fiber from more distant suppliers due to wet weather in the southeast ns clay revenue was up compared to 2002 due to a strong increase in revenue per carload and a more positive mix as ns handled more longhaul domestic traffic lumber business was soft in early 2003 despite strong demand due in part to wet weather and several mill closures lumber business was up in the fourth quarter as weather in the southeast and commodity prices improved 

in 2002 paper clay and forest products traffic volume declined 3 and revenues decreased 1 primarily due to continued weakness in the paper market especially in the first half of the year traffic volume improved later in the year as the paper market strengthened in addition ns gained business from conversion of truck shipments to rail and from continued strength in housing starts revenue per unit benefited from rate increases and a decline in shorterhaul business 

in 2004 paper clay and forest product revenues are expected to experience modest growth consistent with the general outlook for the domestic economy ns revenue growth initiatives will focus on converting motor carrier traffic to rail and offering more transload or railtruck bundled services to nonrail served customers 

k24 

intermodal volume increased 5 and revenues increased 5 compared to 2002 volume growth was driven by improved service performance that enabled the conversion of truck business to rail shipments for assetbased truckload carriers increased 14 as these trucking companies used intermodal to reduce their exposure to driver shortages and the need for larger fleets international volume which represents 45 of intermodal’s volume grew 9 primarily a result of strong import trade and new business driven by enhanced service triple crown services company tcs grew 1 in 2003 hampered by a fleet at full capacity ns is expanding this fleet in 2004 

in 2002 intermodal traffic volume increased 6 and revenues increased 5 compared to 2001 volume growth was principally the result of new and improved services that resulted in new business including the conversion of truck business to rail international traffic which accounts for about half of intermodal volume increased 10 supported by growth in trade activity and new business domestic shipments grew 6 primarily because of new business gained from the conversion of truck shipments tcs volume increased 4 revenue per unit declined as a result of an increase in shorterhaul business and the absence of fuel surcharges that were in place in 2001 which were partially offset by some rate increases 

in 2004 intermodal revenues are expected to benefit from unfavorable forces affecting trucking companies including changes to the highway hours of service laws driver shortages new truck emission standards and accordingly higher truck prices these forces are expected to accelerate truck to rail conversion in addition to creating an environment conducive to rail price increases 

railway operating expenses 

railway operating expenses increased 6 in 2003 while carloads increased 2 expenses in 2003 included 107 million of costs related to a voluntary separation program to reduce the size of the work force which resulted in 2 of the 6 expense increase in 2002 railway operating expenses declined 1 while carloads increased 1 

the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses was 835 in 2003 compared with 815 in 2002 and 837 in 2001 the voluntary separation costs added 16 percentage points to the 2003 ratio 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications 

 

 includes 107 million of voluntary separation costs in 2003 

k25 

compensation and benefits represented 42 of total railway operating expenses and increased 13 in 2003 almost half of the increase was the result of the 107 million voluntary separation program the remaining increase was principally due to higher wage rates including the ble bonus in lieu of wage increases which added 45 million increased health and welfare benefits costs which were up 44 million and reduced pension income down 34 million see note 11 approximately 25 million of the increase in health and welfare benefit costs was attributable to retirees reflecting a higher estimated medical inflation rate ns expects these costs to be down slightly in 2004 a result of a recent plan amendment and changes in medicare coverage see note 11 however ns anticipates that this reduction will largely be offset by lower pension income therefore total pension and postretirement expenses in 2004 are expected to be comparable to 2003 

in 2002 compensation and benefits increased slightly and represented 40 of total railway operating expenses higher wage rates reduced pension income see note 11 and increased health and welfare benefits costs more than offset savings from reduced employment levels and lower payroll taxes see the discussion of the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act below 

the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act which took effect on jan 1 2002 provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of tier ii railroad retirement payroll taxes the phasein calls for a reduction from 142 in 2003 to 131 in 2004 and thereafter in addition the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated these changes resulted in an estimated 21 million reduction in payroll taxes in 2003 and are expected to result in savings of 16 million in 2004 compared with 2003 however these savings are expected to continue to be offset by an increase in the railroad unemployment tax rate higher payroll taxes on increased wages and a higher wage base the new law allows for investment of tier ii assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established national railroad retirement investment trust the law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of future tier ii payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a fouryear reserve or exceed a sixyear reserve 

materials services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines structures and equipment the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses decreased 2 in 2003 and increased 1 in 2002 

the 2003 decline reflected lower equipment rents costs down 26 million and reduced purchased services down 20 million including lower expenses for intermodal automotive and bulk transfer services and professional and legal fees 

the increase in 2002 was the result of higher volumerelated expenses for automotive and intermodal traffic increased material costs for locomotives higher expenses for roadway and bridge repairs and increased derailment costs these higher costs were largely offset by a significant reduction in equipment rents 

equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment decreased 7 in 2003 and 14 in 2002 the decline in 2003 was principally the result of lower automotive traffic volume in addition to adjustments relating to periodic studies of equipment rents and favorable settlements of recent bills in addition the change in accounting related to certain leased locomotives see notes 1 and 6 also reduced equipment rents the decline in 2002 was principally the result of continued improvement in cycle times reflecting efficiency gains and for intermodal equipment service design and process changes implemented during the year 

k26 

locomotive repair costs increased in 2003 and 2002 due to more maintenance activity locomotive and freight car maintenance costs are expected to increase further in 2004 

conrail rents and services increased 2 in 2003 and decreased 2 in 2002 this item includes amounts due to prr and crc for use of their operating properties and equipment and crcs operation of the shared assets areas also included is ns equity in conrails net earnings plus the additional amortization related to the difference between ns investment in conrail and its underlying equity see note 2 the increase in 2003 reflects lower conrail earnings and higher expenses in the shared assets areas whereas the decline in 2002 reflected higher conrail earnings and lower expenses in the shared assets areas see “conrails results of operations financial condition and liquidity” below 

depreciation expense was down slightly in 2003 and up slightly in 2002 substantial levels of capital spending affected both years however expense in 2003 benefited from a change in accounting for the cost to remove crossties see note 1 and expenses in 2002 benefited from lower rates implemented early in the year following completion of a periodic study see note 1 “properties” for ns depreciation policy 

diesel fuel expenses increased 11 in 2003 and decreased 17 in 2002 the increase in 2003 reflects an 11 rise in the average price per gallon and essentially flat consumption the decline in 2002 reflected a 16 drop in the average price per gallon and slightly lower consumption expenses in 2003 and 2002 included benefits of 59 million and 10 million respectively from the diesel fuel hedging program see “market risks and hedging activities” below and note 16 ns has hedged approximately 63 of expected 2004 diesel fuel requirements as of december 31 2003 at an average price of 78 cents per gallon accordingly if diesel fuel prices are volatile during 2004 it is unlikely that ns will experience the same degree of volatility in its diesel fuel expense 

casualties and other claims expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters increased 6 in 2003 and 20 in 2002 the higher expense in 2003 was due to adverse personal injury claims development and derailments earlier in the year as well as higher insurance costs the increase in 2002 reflected adverse personal injury claims development and higher expenses for loss and damage to lading as well as higher insurance and environmental remediation costs 

the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs in 2003 cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 40 of the total employee injury cases settled and 31 of the total settlement payments made injuries of this type are often not caused by a specific accident or event but rather result from a claimed exposure over time many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs 

the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads fela which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers compensation system 

ns like many other businesses in the us has experienced difficulty obtaining property and casualty insurance on reasonable terms after the september 11 terrorist attacks ns has been successful in maintaining a substantial amount of commercial insurance for thirdparty personal injury property damage and fela claims although both the cost of this insurance and the amount of risk that ns retains 

k27 

through selfinsurance have more than doubled since the attacks the magnitude of the premium increases that ns experienced in 2002 began to subside in 2003 however 

other expenses increased 8 in 2003 but decreased 10 in 2002 the increase in 2003 was primarily attributable to higher state franchise and sales and use taxes the absence of a favorable bad debt settlement that benefited 2002 and higher union employee travel expenses the decline in 2002 reflected lower expenses for property and sales and use taxes 

other income – net 

other income – net was 19 million in 2003 66 million in 2002 and 99 million in 2001 see note 3 the decline in 2003 was primarily due to the 84 million telecommunications assets impairment charge that offset increased gains from the sale of properties higher corporateowned life insurance returns and lower interest accruals related to tax liabilities the decline in 2002 was primarily the result of higher interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities lower gains from the sale of properties and investments and the absence of a 13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement that benefited 2001 these reductions were partially offset by reduced discount from the sales of receivables due to a lower amount of receivables sold and a lower interest rate environment which favorably affects the amount of discount 

income taxes 

income tax expense in 2003 was 175 million for an effective rate of 30 compared with effective rates of 35 in 2002 and 2001 excluding ns’ equity in conrails aftertax earnings the effective rate was 33 in 2003 and 38 in 2002 and 2001 

in 2003 the effective rate was reduced by the favorable resolution of prior years’ tax audits the effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities see note 4 

in may 2003 the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of 2003 was signed into law the law increased from 30 to 50 the additional firstyear depreciation allowance for property acquired after may 5 2003 and before january 1 2005 the 30 additional firstyear depreciation allowance was an element of earlier tax legislation the acceleration of tax depreciation deductions allowed by these laws reduces current taxes and increases deferred tax levels by significant amounts 

discontinued operations 

income from discontinued operations in 2003 consisted of a 10 million aftertax gain related to the resolution of tax issues arising from the sale of ns motor carrier subsidiary income from discontinued operations in 2001 consisted of a 13 million aftertax gain resulting from the expiration of certain indemnities contained in the sales agreement see note 17 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash provided by operating activities ns principal source of liquidity was 1054 million in 2003 compared with 803 million in 2002 and 654 million in 2001 the increase in 2003 reflected a smaller change in the amount of accounts receivables sold declines in receivables sold amounted to 30 million in 2003 and 270 million in 2002 see note 5 in 2002 the improvement was the result of higher income 

k28 

from railway operations and favorable changes in working capital which were offset in part by fewer accounts receivable sold see note 5 

payments made to prr which are included in “conrail rents and services” and therefore are a use of cash in “cash provided by operating activities” are largely cash neutral because a significant portion are borrowed back from a prr subsidiary and therefore are a source of cash in “proceeds from borrowings” ns net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to 203 million in 2003 212 million in 2002 and 250 million in 2001 

ns working capital deficit was 376 million at dec 31 2003 compared with 554 million at dec 31 2002 the improvement resulted principally from an increase in cash flow from operations and a reduction in federal income taxes due within one year debt due in 2004 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations including sales of accounts receivable and cash on hand 

ns currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs during 2003 the amount of receivables ns could sell under this program ranged from 358 million to 433 million and the amount of receivables ns sold ranged from zero to 150 million moreover ns has a 1 billion credit facility which expires in 2006 that it can borrow under or use to support commercial paper debt however reductions in its credit rating could limit ns ability to access the commercial paper markets see also the discussion of financing activities below 

ns expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations this expectation is based on a view that the economy will continue a moderate growth rate through 2004 

contractual obligations at dec 31 2003 related to ns longterm debt including capital leases see note 8 operating leases see note 9 agreements with crc see note 2 unconditional purchase obligations see note 18 and other longterm obligations see note 18 are as follows 

 

ns also has a contractual obligation related to a lease covering 140 locomotives the lessor is a specialpurpose entity formed to enter into this transaction but it is not related to ns and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity the lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase however ns has no obligation related to the debt ns has the option to purchase the locomotives but also can return them to the lessor if ns does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value ns does not expect to be required to make any payments under this provision see note 9 as the primary beneficiary of the business of the lessor effective 

k29 

jan 1 2003 ns consolidated the assets locomotives and liabilities debt of this specialpurpose entity when it implemented financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 see note 1 “new accounting pronouncements” 

in addition ns has contractual obligations to prr as disclosed in note 2 however ns has the ability to borrow back funds from prr to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at conrail as an indirect owner of conrail ns may need to make capital contributions loans or advances to conrail to fund its contractual obligations the following table presents 58 of conrails contractual obligations for longterm debt including capital leases and operating leases conrail has no unconditional purchase or other longterm obligations 

 

off balance sheet arrangements consist of an accounts receivable sale program see note 5 under the program ns sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers ns has no ownership interest in the buyers the buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase and ns used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt ns has no obligation related to the buyers debt and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables upon termination of the program the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and would retain collections related to the previously sold receivables see note 5 as of dec 31 2003 there were no accounts receivable sold however ns has the capability to increase the amounts sold as discussed above 

cash used for investing activities decreased 5 in 2003 and increased 12 in 2002 property additions which account for most of the recurring spending in this category were up 4 in 2003 and down 8 in 2002 property sales were higher in 2003 which resulted in the net decrease in cash used for investing activities the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years 

 

capital expenditures increased 4 in 2003 and decreased 7 in 2002 which included 6 million of capitalized leases the increase in 2003 reflects higher locomotive purchases offset in part by lower spending on signal and electrical projects and computers the decline in 2002 reflected higher spending 

k30 

on track program work that was offset by fewer locomotive purchases 50 in 2002 compared with 100 in 2001 and lower spending for intermodal facilities 

ns and six other railroads five class i railroads and a commuter railroad have agreed to participate in the chicago region environmental and transportation efficiency create project in chicago the project is a proposed publicprivate partnership between the railroads and city state and federal governments to design and implement a comprehensive plan to keep passenger and freight trains moving on schedule through the metropolitan chicago area the largest rail transportation hub in the us the intent is to reduce rail and highway congestion and add freight and passenger capacity the project is estimated to cost 15 billion with city state and federal support the railroads’ financial contribution to the project is contingent upon a binding commitment that establishes the availability on terms and conditions satisfactory to the railroads of all required public funding and of thirdparty properties necessary to complete the entire project if public funding is secured the railroads will contribute a total of 232 million towards the project with ns’ share slated to be 34 million over an estimated sixyear period 

 

 

the table above excludes equipment leased from prr see note 2 which comprises 17 of the freight car fleet and 22 of the locomotive fleet 

through its coal car rebody program which was suspended in 2000 ns converted about 29000 hopper cars into highcapacity steel gondolas or hoppers as a result the remaining service life of the freightcar fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above 

for 2004 ns has budgeted 810 million for capital expenditures the anticipated spending includes 517 million for roadway projects of which 384 million is for track and bridge program work also included are projects for communications signal and electrical systems as well as projects for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations and signal upgrades other roadway projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives including increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution facilities and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure equipment spending of 220 million includes the purchase of 100 locomotives and upgrades to existing units improvements to multilevel automobile racks and projects related to computers and information technology including additional security and backup systems 

k31 

cash used for financing activities was 314 million in 2003 and 150 million in 2002 financing activities provided cash of 151 million in 2001 the comparisons reflect net reductions of debt in 2003 and 2002 and a net increase in 2001 financing activities include loan transactions with a subsidiary of prr that resulted in net borrowings of 203 million in 2003 212 million in 2002 and 250 million in 2001 see note 2 excluding these borrowings debt was reduced 370 million in 2003 303 million in 2002 and 20 million in 2001 ns debttototal capitalization ratio excluding notes payable to the prr subsidiary at year end was 507 in 2003 and 531 in 2002 

in 2003 ns redeemed all publicly held shares of norfolk southern railway’s 260 cumulative preferred stock series a for a redemption price of 50 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends for an aggregate redemption price of 502066 the total use of cash was 43 million 

ns currently has in place and available a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants see note 8 

ns has outstanding 717 million of its 705 notes due may 1 2037 each holder of a 2037 note may require ns to redeem all or part of the note at face value plus accrued and unpaid interest on may 1 2004 ns will not know the amount of 2037 notes that it may be required to redeem until april 1 2004 should it be necessary ns has the ability and intent to refinance such notes properly presented 

application of critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require management to change them accordingly management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances management discusses the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance management engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities 

ns net pension benefit which is included in “compensation and benefits” on its consolidated income statement was 25 million for the year ended dec 31 2003 including 19 million related to the voluntary separation program in recording this amount ns assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 9 investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10 15 and 20year periods has 

k32 

been in excess of 10 a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 17 million change to the pension credit and as a result an equal change in “compensation and benefits” expense changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future the net pension asset is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment therefore management has little discretion in this assumption 

ns net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in “compensation and benefits” was 80 million for the year ended dec 31 2003 which included 22 million related to the voluntary separation program in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits which is included in “other benefits” as disclosed in note 11 management estimated future increases in healthcare costs these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note 11 additionally as discussed in note 11 recent changes to medicare are expected to reduce ns’ postretirement benefit costs 

properties and depreciation 

most of ns total assets are comprised of longlived railway properties see note 6 and its investment in conrail see note 2 most of conrails assets are longlived railway properties as disclosed in note 1 ns properties are depreciated using group depreciation rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by grosston miles other properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows or estimated net realizable value assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value ns is amortizing the excess of the purchase price paid for its investment in conrail over its share of conrails net equity using the principles of purchase accounting based primarily on the estimated remaining useful lives of conrails properties 

ns depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement these assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation studies that are performed by a firm of consulting engineers these studies analyze ns historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices ns recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense the studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property ns “depreciation expense” for the year ended dec 31 2003 amounted to 513 million ns weightedaverage depreciation rates for 2003 are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would result in a 18 million increase or decrease to ns depreciation expense

ns expense for “casualties and other claims” amounted to 181 million for the year ended dec 31 2003 most of this expense was composed of ns accrual related to personal injury liabilities see discussion of fela in the discussion captioned “casualties and other claims” on page k27 ns engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year the actuarial firm studies ns historical patterns of reserving for 

k33 

claims and subsequent settlements the actuary also takes into account outside influences considered pertinent the study uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting actuary and management in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which ns would recognize when such a change became known the most recent actuarial study was performed as of sept 30 2003 and resulted in a slight decrease to ns personal injury liability during the fourth quarter while the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study it is reasonably possible that the liability could be higher or lower 

ns is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations it is ns policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 18 environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy 

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately 9 million in 2003 15 million in 2002 and 12 million in 2001 and capital expenditures totaled approximately 9 million in 2003 and 10 million in both 2002 and 2001 capital expenditures in 2004 are expected to be comparable to those in 2003 

ns balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of 25 million at dec 31 2003 and 29 million at dec 31 2002 of which 8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year at dec 31 2003 the liability represented ns estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 113 identified locations on that date 10 sites accounted for 12 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period 

at some of the 113 locations certain ns subsidiaries usually in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statutes which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs 

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss and that participants ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site as a result it is not practical to quantitatively describe the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities 

the risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the railroad business some of the commodities in ns traffic mix particularly those classified as hazardous materials can pose special risks that ns and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize in addition several ns subsidiaries own or have owned land used as operating property or which is leased and operated by others or held for sale because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed there can be 

k34 

no assurance that ns will not incur environmentally related liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time moreover lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter 

however based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the corporation is aware further management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to expenses while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments in managements opinion the recorded liability if any is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter any adjustments to recorded liabilities will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known 

income taxes 

ns net longterm deferred tax liability totaled 3223 million at dec 31 2003 see note 4 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized ns has a 22 million valuation allowance on 628 million of deferred tax assets as of dec 31 2003 reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized for 2003 2002 and 2001 the effective tax rates excluding ns equity in conrails earnings were 33 38 and 38 respectively for every one half percent change in the 2003 effective tax rate net income would have changed by 3 million 

conrails results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

conrails net income was 203 million in 2003 compared with 180 million in 2002 and 174 million in 2001 see note 2 results in 2003 included 40 million for the cumulative effect on years prior to 2003 of a change in accounting principles as required by conrail’s adoption of sfas no 143 ns excluded this amount from its determination of equity in earnings of conrail because an amount related to conrail is included in ns’ cumulative effect adjustment for sfas no 143 conrail’s income before the accounting change was 163 million 17 million below 2002 reflecting lower income from operations 

conrails operating revenues were 918 million in 2003 893 million in 2002 and 903 million in 2001 the 2003 increase was primarily attributable to higher operating fees related to prr and nyc the decrease in 2002 resulted from the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees largely because of reduced operating costs in the shared assets areas 

k35 

conrails operating expenses were 659 million in 2003 623 million in 2002 and 639 million in 2001 the increase in 2003 was primarily the result of higher expenses for compensation and benefits and casualties and insurance the decrease in 2002 reflected lower expenses for materials services and rents and compensation and benefits which were offset in part by higher costs for casualties and other claims 

conrails cash provided by operations decreased 11 million or 3 in 2003 and 79 million or 16 in 2002 the decrease in 2003 reflects the absence of an irs refund received in 2002 that was partially offset by a decreased use of cash for casualty payments the decline in 2002 was primarily the result of the absence of two items that benefited 2001 a 50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license manage and market signboard advertising on conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement this was offset in part by favorable changes in working capital cash generated from operations is conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures debt repayments totaled 57 million in 2003 and 59 million in 2002 capital expenditures totaled 35 million in 2003 and 23 million in 2002 

conrail had a working capital deficit of 22 million at dec 31 2003 and 29 million at dec 31 2002 conrail is not an sec registrant and therefore presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations 

ns equity in earnings of conrail net of amortization was 58 million in 2003 54 million in 2002 and 44 million in 2001 ns other comprehensive income loss for 2003 2002 and 2001 as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity included a 14 million gain a 34 million loss and a 41 million loss respectively for its portion of conrails other comprehensive loss see note 13 

other matters 

labor agreements 

approximately 24000 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 14 different labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act moratorium provisions in these agreements permitted ns and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999 negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter 

agreements have been reached with the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes bmwe which represents about 4200 ns employees the united transportation union utu which represents about 6700 ns employees the international brotherhood of boilermakers and blacksmiths ibb which represents about 100 ns employees the transportation communications international union tcu which represents about 4400 ns employees the american train dispatchers department atdd which represents about 400 ns employees the brotherhood of railroad signalmen brs which represents about 1100 ns employees and the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble which represents about 4500 ns employees the agreement with the ble was through 2004 ns recently reached a further contract extension with ble through 2009 a tentative agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew which represents about 900 ns employees failed ratification 

health and welfare issues have been resolved with bmwe tcu brs ble and utu health and welfare issues with the other organizations have not yet been resolved

market risks and hedging activities 

ns uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 

in 2001 ns began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption the intent of the program is to assist in the management of ns aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations which can significantly affect ns operating margins and profitability through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments 

diesel fuel costs represented 7 of ns operating expenses for 2003 the program provides that ns will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months and that no more than 80 of ns average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for any month within any 36month period 

as of dec 31 2003 through swap transactions ns has hedged approximately 63 of expected 2004 diesel fuel requirements the effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 78 cents per hedged gallon including federal taxes and transportation a 10 decrease in diesel fuel prices would reduce ns asset related to the swaps by approximately 38 million as of dec 31 2003 

ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments and by entering into interestrate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio 

at dec 31 2003 ns debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 636 million excluding debt due to the prr subsidiary a 1 increase in interest rates would increase ns total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately 6 million management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity 

some of ns capital leases which carry an average fixed rate of 7 were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements on dec 31 2003 the average pay rate under these agreements was 16 and the average receive rate was 7 during 2003 the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by 10 million a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yendenominated obligation most of these deposits are held by foreign banks primarily japanese as a result ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy 

new accounting pronouncements 

as discussed in note 1 effective jan 1 2003 ns adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” sfas no 143 and fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin no 46 

inflation 

in preparing financial statements accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require the use of historical cost that disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property ns a capitalintensive company has most of its capital invested in such assets the 

k37 

replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost 

trends 

federal economic regulation  efforts may be made in 2004 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially reduced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business ns and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation 

utility deregulation  deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties the effects of deregulation on ns and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty however ns serves a number of efficient power producers who are expected to remain competitive in this evolving environment 

carbonbased fuel  there is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbonbased fuel including coal are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes to the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policymakers the impact could be either a reduction in the demand for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coalfired facilities even more difficult the revenues and net income of nsr and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely

freight rates   in 2002 ns railroads continued their reliance on private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing mechanisms thus a major portion of ns railroads freight business is not currently economically regulated by the government in general market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are the primary determinant of rail service prices however in 2002 there were significant coal movements moving under common carrier tariff rates which had previously moved under rates contained in transportation contracts beginning jan 1 2002 coal moving to duke energys duke belews creek allen buck and dan river generating stations moved under common carrier rates and beginning april 1 2002 coal moving to carolina power and lights cpl hyco and mayo plants moved under common carrier rates duke and cpl have challenged the reasonableness of these common carrier rates in proceedings currently pending before the surface transportation board

 

in 2002 ns railroads were found by the stb not to be revenue adequate based on results for the year 2001 a railroad is revenue adequate under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industrys composite cost of capital this determination is made pursuant to statutory requirement and does not adversely impact ns liquidity or capital resources

 

passenger operations   regularly scheduled passenger trains are operated by amtrak on ns lines between alexandria and new orleans and between greensboro and selma north carolina commuter trains are operated on the ns line between manassas and alexandria in accordance with contracts with two transportation commissions of the commonwealth of virginia ns also leases the chicago to manhattan illinois line to the commuter rail division of the regional transportation authority of northeast illinois since june 1 1999 norfolk southern railway has operated former conrail lines on which amtrak conducts regularly scheduled passenger operations between chicago illinois and detroit michigan and between chicago and harrisburg pennsylvania

 

also since june 1 1999 through its operation of prrs routes norfolk southern railway has been providing freight service over former conrail lines with significant ongoing amtrak and commuter passenger operations and is conducting freight operations over some trackage owned by amtrak or by new jersey transit the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority metronorth commuter railway company and maryland dot finally passenger operations are conducted either by amtrak or by the commuter agencies over trackage owned by pennsylvania lines llc or by conrail in the shared assets areas

 

noncarrier operations   ns noncarrier subsidiaries engage principally in the acquisition leasing and management of coal oil gas and minerals the development of commercial real estate telecommunications and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment in 2002 no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business segment set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 131

 

 

railway property 

 

the ns railroad system extends across 22 states and portions of canada the railroad infrastructure makes the company very capital intensive with total property of approximately 11 billion and investment in conrail of approximately 6 billion

 

 

k8

capital expenditures  capital expenditures for road equipment and other property for the past five years were as follows including capitalized leases

 

  

capital spending and maintenance programs are and have been designed to assure the ability to provide safe efficient and reliable transportation services for 2003 ns has budgeted 798 million of capital spending see the discussion following cash used for investing activities in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis

 

equipment  as of dec 31 2002 ns owned or leased the following units of equipment

 

  

 

k9

the following table indicates the number and year built for locomotives and freight cars owned at dec 31 2002

 

  

as of dec 31 2002 the average age of the locomotive fleet was 161 years during 2002 52 locomotives the average age of which was 282 years were retired the average age of the freight car fleet at dec 31 2002 was 259 years during 2002 3013 freight cars were retired

 

since 1988 about 29000 coal cars have been rebodied as a result the remaining serviceability of the freight car fleet is greater than may be inferred from the high percentage of freight cars built in earlier years

 

  

ongoing freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended to ensure the highest standards of safety reliability customer satisfaction and equipment marketability in past years the freight car bad order ratio reflected the storage of certain types of cars that were not in high demand the ratio rose in 2000 2001 and 2002 as a result of decreased maintenance activity a review began in 2002 to address several hundred unserviceable overage and commercially obsolete freight cars which will likely result in their disposition in 2003 the locomotive bad order ratio includes units out of service for required inspections every 92 days and program work such as overhauls the increase in the locomotive bad order ratio in 1999 was primarily due to the maintenance requirements of units being rented to meet shortterm needs and to weatherrelated failures the ratio rose slightly in 2000 as maintenance activities were curtailed in response to a slowing economy the elevated ratio through 2001 and 2002 reflected units out of service related to the resumption of maintenance and modification activities

 

track maintenance  of the approximately 38500 total miles of track operated ns had responsibility for maintaining about 31000 miles of track with the remainder being operated under trackage rights over 75 of the main line trackage including first second third and branch main tracks all excluding trackage rights has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 141 pounds per yard approximately 40 of ns lines carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile

 

 

k10

the following table summarizes several measurements regarding ns track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years

 

  

microwave system   the ns microwave system consisting of approximately 7282 radio route miles 442 active stations and 4 passive repeater stations provides communications between most operating locations the microwave system is used primarily for voice communications vhf radio control circuits data and facsimile transmissions traffic control operations and aei data transmissions

 

traffic control  of a total of 21500 route miles operated by ns excluding trackage rights over foreign lines 11511 miles are signalized including 8546 miles of centralized traffic control ctc and 2965 miles of automatic block signals of the 8546 miles of ctc 1895 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 148 base station radio sites

 

computers   a computer network consisting of a centralized data center in atlanta georgia and various distributed computers throughout the company connects the yards terminals transportation offices rolling stock repair points sales offices and other key system locations operating and traffic data are processed and stored to provide customers with information on their shipments throughout the system computer systems provide current information on the location of every train and each car on line as well as related waybill and other train and car movement data in addition the computer systems are utilized to assist management in the performance of a variety of functions and services including payroll car and revenue accounting billing material management activities and controls and special studies

 

other  the railroads have extensive facilities for support of operations including freight depots car construction shops maintenance shops office buildings and signals and communications facilities

 

encumbrances  certain railroad equipment is subject to the prior lien of equipment financing obligations amounting to approximately 864 million as of dec 31 2002 and 895 million at dec 31 2001

 

environmental matters  compliance with federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is a principal ns goal to date such compliance has not affected materially ns capital additions earnings liquidity or competitive position see the discussion of environmental matters in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis and in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

 

employees   ns employed an average of 28970 employees in 2002 compared with an average of 30894 in 2001 the decrease reflects ns continuous drive to operate more efficiently accompanied by railroad retirement legislation late in 2001 which lowered the retirement age for rail employees the approximate average cost per employee during 2002 was 54000 in wages and 24000 in employee benefits

 

approximately 85 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions see the discussion of labor agreements in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis

 

government regulation   in addition to environmental safety securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses ns railroads are subject to regulation by the stb which succeeded the icc on jan 1 1996 the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers the department of transportation regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards

 

the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads begun over two decades ago by the icc under the staggers rail act of 1980 has continued under the stb significant exemptions are tofccofc ie piggyback

 

 

k11

business rail boxcar traffic lumber manufactured steel automobiles and certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for paper manufacturing transportation contracts on regulated shipments effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well about 80 of ns freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or traffic moving under transportation contracts

 

efforts may be made in 2003 to resubject the rail industry to unwarranted federal economic regulation the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially reduced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry accordingly ns will oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation

 

competition   there is continuing strong competition among rail water and highway carriers price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods machinery and consumer products even for raw materials semifinished goods and workinprocess users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages

 

ns primary rail competitor is the csx system both operate throughout much of the same territory other railroads also operate in parts of the territory ns also competes with motor carriers water carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of handling their own goods in private carriage

 

certain marketing strategies between railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more effectively in specific markets

managements discussion and analysis of 

financial condition and results of operations 

 

 

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes and the fiveyear financial review

 

 

summarized results of operations 

 

2002 compared with 2001 

 

net income was 460 million in 2002 up 85 million or 23 results in 2001 included a 13 million gain from discontinued operations related to the 1998 sale of ns former motor carrier subsidiary see note 17 excluding that gain from 2001s results net income was up 98 million or 27 in 2002 the improvement was primarily the result of a 151 million or 15 increase in income from railway operations

 

diluted earnings per share were 118 up 22 excluding the discontinued operations gain diluted earnings per share increased 26

 

2001 compared with 2000 

 

net income in 2001 was 375 million up 118 income from continuing operations which excludes the 13 million discontinued operations gain was 362 million up 110 results in 2000 included 165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force which reduced income from continuing operations by 101 million or 26 cents per diluted share excluding these costs income from continuing operations increased 89 million or 33 in 2001 the improvement resulted from higher income from railway operations which was up 209 million or 26 that more than offset lower nonoperating income which was down 69 million see note 3

 

diluted earnings per share were 97 cents up 116 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 94 cents up 109 excluding the workforce reduction costs in 2000 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 32

 

 

detailed results of operations 

 

railway operating revenues 

 

railway operating revenues were 63 billion in 2002 and 62 billion in both 2001 and 2000 the following table presents a threeyear comparison of revenues by market group

 

 

k16

 

  

in 2002 revenues increased 2 as a 3 rise in general merchandise revenues coupled with a 5 improvement in intermodal revenues offset a 5 decline in coal revenues all but one of the general merchandise market groups paper clay and forest products posted increases over 2001 as shown in the following table most of the revenue improvement was the result of higher traffic volumes the favorable revenue per unitmix variance was driven by higher average revenue per unit offset in part by the effects of unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic

 

  

in 2001 revenues fell for all the general merchandise market groups however a 6 increase in coal revenues offset the effects of the lower general merchandise revenues revenue per unit increased in all market groups principally due to rate increases use of highercapacity equipment and favorable changes in the mix of traffic

 

coal tonnage decreased 4 in 2002 and revenues declined 5 revenue per unit declined slightly reflecting unfavorable changes in the mix of traffic more shorterhaul business that offset the effects of rate increases and gains in tonnage per car coal coke and iron ore represented 23 of total railway operating revenues in 2002 and 84 of ns coal shipments originated on lines it operates

 

in 2001 coal tonnage increased 2 and revenues improved 6 revenue per unit increased 6 a result of rate increases including lower volumerelated refunds on export coal shipments gains in tonnage per car and favorable changes in the mix of traffic less shorterhaul business

 

 

k17 

  

utility coal tonnage decreased 3 in 2002 a result of lower demand that reflected the weak economy high coal stockpile levels entering the year mild temperatures in the first quarter reduced stockpile targets set by utility companies and increased generation from new natural gasfired plants licensing requirements for these new plants resulted in additional generation that temporarily displaced coalfired generation

 

in 2001 utility coal traffic increased 11 reflecting higher demand for coalfired electricity and the effects of very high natural gas prices early in the year high demand for coal a volatile market for natural gas and production problems at a number of large mines in the east late in 2000 combined to increase demand somewhat early in 2001 with a resulting increase in coal prices utility coal traffic volume also benefited somewhat from the shifting of coal that traditionally would have been bound for export to the domestic market

 

two of ns utility customers duke energy duke and carolina power and light cpl have filed rate reasonableness complaints at the surface transportation board stb alleging that the ns tariff rates for the transportation of coal to their solely served power plants are unreasonable ns is disputing these allegations since january 1 2002 in the case of duke and since april 1 2002 in the case of cpl ns has been billing and collecting amounts from the customers based on the challenged tariff rates management expects that the resolution of these cases which is anticipated to occur in 2003 will not have a material effect on ns financial statements

 

the nearterm outlook for utility coal remains positive coalfired generation remains the lowest cost marginal source of electricity coal plant generation should continue to track the us economy and management expects that utilities will use coalfired plants to meet increased demand because of coals low cost as always demand will be influenced by the weather in addition while the price of natural gas can affect demand for utility coal its higher price and volatility may improve the longterm competitive position of coalfired generation

 

phase ii of title iv of the clean air act amendments of 1990 which imposed more stringent limits on sulfur dioxide emissions took effect on jan 1 2000 many of the mines served by ns produce coals that satisfy phase ii requirements in addition substantial banks of sulfur dioxide allowances held by many nsserved utilities as well as implementation of sulfur dioxide emission control systems at many nsserved plants should continue to provide a market for other nsserved mines

 

while the phase ii impact on ns utility coal has been minimal there are a number of other evolving environmental issues that have the potential to increase or ease cost pressures on the utility coal market depending upon their outcome these include a potential new national energy policy proposed multipollutant legislation a proposed new rule concerning new source review the impending mercury emissions standard and the fate of us participation in the kyoto protocol

 

 

k18

although impending developments with these environmental issues could potentially increase cost pressures on coalfired generation the outlook remains positive for maintaining coals position in the power generation mix for regions served by ns however different developments with these issues could actually ease cost pressures on coalfired generation further strengthening coals position

 

the 1999 decision by a federal district court judge in west virginia holding that some common mountaintop mining practices in the coal industry are illegal was overturned in april 2001 by the us fourth circuit court of appeals in january 2002 the us supreme court refused to hear an appeal of the case in may 2002 the same district court judge made a similar ruling in a different case in which ns had again intervened in january 2003 this ruling also was overturned by the fourth circuit court of appeals

 

export coal tonnage declined 18 in 2002 steam coal exports through baltimore declined 4 and export metallurgical coals through norfolk declined 22 during the first half of 2002 demand for us coal was soft as international buyers focused their purchases toward other lowerpriced sources market uncertainty resulted in late contract settlements and delayed shipments late in 2002 demand for us coking coals increased reflecting a shift in the market as exports from china australia and poland declined as a result shipments through norfolk increased in the fourth quarter

 

in 2001 export coal tonnage decreased 30 the rapid rise of domestic utility coal prices early in the year enticed many foreignmarket suppliers to place much of their 2001 production in the domestic utility markets in addition production difficulties at several large nsserved mines and flooding in west virginia in july significantly reduced the supply of low volatility coal the combination of these factors resulted in most of the decline in shipments of export coal steam coal exports through baltimore declined 32 and export metallurgical coals through norfolk declined by 30 demand for steam coal to export strengthened in the last half of 2001 however strong us demand limited ns participation in this market demand for coking coal to export continued to soften as steel production moved from traditional ns markets in europe to asia which in recent years has been supplied by australian or canadian coals

 

it is expected that export coal tonnage will continue to be limited by supply and subject to the fluctuations of the world market the increase in demand for us coals seen in the fourth quarter of 2002 has continued into the first quarter of 2003 and early indications are that these market forces should remain in place as contracts are settled in the spring for the coming year should these market forces continue us coal export volumes could recover somewhat however the inherent volatility and uncertainties in this market make predictions especially vulnerable

 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage increased 5 in 2002 reflecting higher us steel production that was aided by the imported steel tariff program implemented in 2002 in addition continued strong vehicle production resulted in demand for steel

 

in 2001 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore tonnage decreased 18 due to a decline in the market for domestic steel the softening economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace production sharply reducing the demand for coking coal iron ore and coke the increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put pressure on the us steel industry and led to plant closures and bankruptcies that included some ns customers

 

domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore traffic is expected to continue to experience modest gains during the twoyear life of the import tariffs however longterm demand is expected to decline reflecting advanced technologies that allow production of steel using less coke

 

 

k19

other coal tonnage principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing plants decreased 14 in 2002 but increased 6 in 2001 the decline in 2002 was primarily the result of the weak economy the gain in 2001 resulted from new and increased business from industrial customers

 

general merchandise traffic volume carloads increased 2 in 2002 and revenues increased 3 principally due to a 9 improvement in automotive revenues in 2001 traffic volume decreased 7 and revenues decreased 2 reflecting the effects of a weak economy

 

automotive traffic volume increased 7 and revenues increased 9 in 2002 principally due to a rise in vehicle production and new business revenue per unit increased 2 reflecting some pricing improvements extended length of haul special ancillary services and the settlement of a disputed charge

 

in 2001 automotive traffic volume decreased 10 and revenues declined 4 principally due to a 10 drop in vehicle production revenue per unit increased 7 principally due to rate increases efficiencies gained from the redesign of the mixing center network and use of higher capacity equipment

 

automotive revenues in 2003 are expected to be lower than those of 2002 light vehicle production is predicted to be down slightly and ns largest automotive customer has announced a 5 decrease in first quarter 2003 production

 

chemicals traffic volume increased slightly and revenues increased 2 in 2002 higher traffic volume for plastics and a small increase for miscellaneous chemicals offset a decline for petroleum products demand for plastics was supported by increases in light vehicle production and housing starts traffic volume also benefited from increased shipments through ns thoroughbred bulk transfer tbt facilities that handle chemicals and bulk commodities for customers not located on nsserved lines revenue per unit increased as a result of a favorable change in the mix of traffic more higherrated business and marketdriven rate increases

 

in 2001 chemicals traffic volume decreased 5 and revenues decreased 1 the weak economy depressed shipments of petroleum plastics industrial and miscellaneous chemicals these declines were partially offset by new business through ns tbt facilities revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and a favorable change in the mix of traffic more longerhaul moves

 

chemicals revenues are expected to improve in 2003 supported by a recovering economy new business and improved revenue per unit

 

metals and construction traffic volume increased 2 and revenues improved 3 in 2002 reflecting improvement in the steel industry which was aided by the twoyear imported steel tariff program implemented in 2002 metals volume benefited from resumption of production at some mills that closed in 2001 and increased volume from new mills construction traffic declined primarily as a result of reductions in highway projects due to state government budget pressures

 

in 2001 metals and construction traffic volume decreased 7 and revenues declined 2 reflecting weakness in the steel and construction industries the steel industry recession which began in 2000 resulted in excess capacity and the closing of numerous steel mills revenue per unit increased due to higher rates and favorable changes in the mix of traffic

 

metals and construction revenues are expected to continue to benefit from added production along ns lines although further consolidation in the steel industry is expected construction markets may benefit from new business from stone quarries and cement terminals in the southeast

 

agriculture consumer products and government traffic volume decreased slightly in 2002 but revenues increased 3 traffic volume increases for corn food products and beverages largely offset declines for soybeans and feed corn volume benefited from increased shipments from the midwest to

k20

droughtstricken areas in the east the increase for food products was primarily the result of new business soybean and feed volumes were adversely affected by lower domestic and export demand revenue per unit increased because of higher rates increased length of haul and favorable changes in the mix of traffic

 

in 2001 agriculture consumer products and government traffic volume decreased 3 and revenues declined 1 primarily due to reduced shipments of fertilizer this decline was due to soft farm demand record high natural gas prices early in the year which curtailed production of certain fertilizers and increased imports this was mitigated by traffic volume increases for grain flour and canned goods the revenue per unit increase was primarily due to favorable changes in the mix of traffic

 

agriculture consumer products and government revenues in 2003 are expected to continue to benefit from higher corn fertilizer and food product volume fertilizer volumes may be favorably affected by the reopening of a large phosphate fertilizer plant

 

paper clay and forest products traffic volume declined 3 and revenues decreased 1 in 2002 primarily due to continued weakness in the paper market especially in the first half of the year traffic volume improved later in the year as the paper market strengthened in addition ns gained business from conversion of truck shipments to rail and from continued strength in housing starts revenue per unit benefited from rate increases and a decline in shorterhaul business

 

in 2001 paper clay and forest products traffic volume declined 8 and revenues decreased 3 primarily due to a weakened paper market paper shipments were adversely affected by reduced production at many nsserved paper mills a result of sluggish newspaper advertising and soft demand for paper lumber traffic began the year weak improved in late summer but softened late in the year due to shortterm weakness in housing starts revenue per unit increased principally due to higher rates

 

paper clay and forest products revenues are expected to improve slightly in 2003 as a result of a recovering economy service improvements and new business

 

intermodal traffic volume increased 6 and revenues increased 5 in 2002 volume growth was principally the result of new and improved services that resulted in new business including the conversion of truck business to rail international traffic which accounts for about half of intermodal volume increased 10 supported by growth in trade activity and new business including the conversion of overtheroad traffic domestic shipments grew 6 primarily because of new business gained from the conversion of truck shipments triple crown services company tcs volume increased 4 revenue per unit declined as a result of an increase in shorterhaul business and the absence of fuel surcharges that were in place in 2001 which were partially offset by some rate increases

 

in 2001 intermodal traffic volume decreased 1 but revenues increased slightly domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year but demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed which eroded ns base of traffic new business supported by the opening of three new terminals and other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy international traffic grew slightly as us imports slowed with the economy tcs traffic volume increased 1 despite economic conditions as it continued to provide reliable trucklike service intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year reflecting the expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the introduction of new shorterhaul business

 

in 2003 intermodal revenues are expected to continue to benefit from new business supported by continued improvements in service and conversion of truck traffic to rail

 

 

k21

railway operating expenses 

 

railway operating expenses decreased 1 in 2002 while carloads increased 1 in 2001 railway operating expenses declined 7 however expenses in 2000 included 165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce the size of the work force excluding these costs railway operating expenses decreased 4 in 2001 while carloads dropped 3

 

the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses was 815 in 2002 compared with 837 in 2001 and 87 in 2000 excluding the workforce reduction costs which increased the ratio 27 percentage points both declines primarily resulted from gains in efficiency although 2002 also benefited from higher traffic volume and 2001 benefited from increased revenue per unit the efficiency gains in 2002 were principally the result of the implementation of a new operating plan that emphasizes adherence to a schedule and reductions in service variability these improvements came despite a continuing change in the mix of traffic more resourceintensive traffic such as automotive and intermodal coupled with the decrease in export coal traffic

 

the following table shows the changes in railway operating expenses summarized by major classifications

 

  

 includes 165 million of workforce reduction costs in 2000

 

compensation and benefits represented 40 of total railway operating expenses and increased slightly in 2002 higher wage rates reduced pension income see note 11 and increased health and welfare benefits costs more than offset savings from reduced employment levels and lower payroll taxes see the discussion of the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act below medical costs are expected to continue to increase in 2003 a result of higher costs for active employees and an increase in the expected inflation related to postretirement benefits

 

in 2001 compensation and benefits decreased 10 however this comparison reflects the 165 million of workforce reduction costs in 2000 excluding those costs compensation and benefits decreased 3 primarily a result of savings attributable to the reduced size of the work force which were somewhat offset by higher wages and benefit costs for union employees higher incentive compensation and reduced pension income

 

the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act which took effect on jan 1 2002 provides for a phased reduction of the employers portions of tier ii railroad retirement payroll taxes the phasein calls for a reduction from 156 in 2002 to 142 in 2003 and 131 in 2004 in addition the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated these changes resulted in an estimated 21 million reduction in payroll taxes in 2002 and are expected to result in savings of 20 million in 2003 compared with 2002 however these

 

 

k22

savings are expected to be offset by an increase in the railroad unemployment tax rate higher payroll taxes on increased wages and a higher wage base the new law allows for investment of tier ii assets in a diversified portfolio through the newly established national railroad retirement investment trust the law also provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment of future tier ii payroll taxes should the trust assets fall below a fouryear reserve or exceed a sixyear reserve

 

materials services and rents includes items used for the maintenance of the railroads lines structures and equipment the costs of services purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of equipment rentals this category of expenses increased 1 in 2002 and decreased slightly in 2001

 

the increase in 2002 was the result of higher volumerelated expenses for automotive and intermodal traffic increased material costs for locomotives higher expenses for roadway and bridge repairs and increased derailment costs these higher costs were largely offset by a significant reduction in equipment rents in 2001 the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset by higher costs for purchased services including expenses for software consulting and legal fees

 

equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment decreased 14 in 2002 and 11 in 2001 the decline in 2002 was principally the result of continued improvement in cycle times reflecting efficiency gains and for intermodal equipment service design and process changes implemented during the year the decrease in 2001 was primarily due to shorter car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight car and locomotive leases

 

locomotive repair costs increased in 2002 and 2001 principally due to renewed maintenance activity which is expected to continue into 2003 freight car maintenance costs which were relatively flat in 2002 are also likely to increase in 2003 as it is expected that the economy will recover and more freight cars are due for maintenance

 

conrail rents and services decreased 2 in 2002 and 12 in 2001 this item includes amounts due to prr and crc for use of their operating properties and equipment and crcs operation of the shared assets areas also included is ns equity in conrails net earnings plus the additional amortization related to the difference between ns investment in conrail and its underlying equity see note 2 both declines reflected higher conrail earnings and lower expenses in the shared assets areas see conrails results of operations financial condition and liquidity below

 

depreciation expense was up slightly in 2002 and increased 2 in 2001 substantial levels of capital spending affected both years however depreciation expense in 2002 benefited from lower rates implemented early in the year following completion of a periodic study see note 1 properties for ns depreciation policy

 

diesel fuel expenses decreased 17 in 2002 and 14 in 2001 the decline in 2002 reflected a 16 drop in the average price per gallon and slightly lower consumption expenses in 2002 included a 10 million benefit from the hedging program initiated in the second quarter of 2001 see market risks and hedging activities below and note 16 the decrease in 2001 was the result of an 8 drop in consumption and a 7 decline in the average price per gallon expenses in 2001 included 8 million of cost related to the hedging program ns expects diesel fuel prices to be higher in 2003

 

casualties and other claims expenses including the estimates of costs related to personal injury property damage and environmental matters increased 20 in 2002 but only slightly in 2001 the increase in 2002 reflected adverse personal injury claims development as indicated by an actuarial study and higher expenses for loss and damage to lading as well as higher insurance and environmental remediation costs

 

 

k23

the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is personal injury costs in 2002 cases involving occupational injuries comprised about 30 of the total employee injury cases settled and 24 of the total settlement payments made injuries of this type are not generally caused by a specific accident or event but rather result from a claimed exposure over time many such claims are being asserted by former or retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the rail industry for decades ns continues to work actively to eliminate all employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs

 

the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because of the federal employers liability act fela which is applicable only to railroads this law which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries produces results that are unpredictable and inconsistent as compared with a nofault workers compensation system

 

ns like many other businesses in the us has experienced difficulty obtaining property and casualty insurance at reasonable terms since the september 11 terrorist attacks thus far ns has been successful in maintaining a substantial amount of commercial insurance for thirdparty personal injury property damage and fela claims that exceed the selfinsured retention however both the cost of this commercial insurance and the amount of risk that ns retains through selfinsurance has more than doubled since the attacks

 

other expenses decreased 10 in 2002 and 13 in 2001 the decline in 2002 reflected lower expenses for property and sales and use taxes the decrease in 2001 was principally the result of lower bad debt costs reduced franchise and property taxes and lower travel and employeerelocation expenses

 

other income – net 

 

other income – net was 66 million in 2002 99 million in 2001 and 168 million in 2000 see note 3 the decline in 2002 was primarily the result of higher interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities lower gains from the sale of properties and investments and the absence of a 13 million gain from a nonrecurring settlement that benefited 2001 these reductions were partially offset by reduced discount from the sales of receivables due to a lower amount of receivables sold and a lower interest rate environment which favorably affects the amount of discount the reduction in 2001 resulted from the absence of 101 million of gains that occurred in 2000 related to the sale of timber rights and gas and oil royalty and working interests this was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals on federal income tax liabilities and the 13 million nonrecurring settlement gain results in 2001 also included an 18 million gain from a large property sale that closed in december

 

income taxes 

 

income tax expense in 2002 was 246 million for an effective rate of 35 compared with effective rates of 35 in 2001 and 31 in 2000 excluding the equity in conrails aftertax earnings the effective rates were 38 in 2002 and 2001 and 34 in 2000

 

the effective rates in 2002 and 2001 were higher than that of 2000 primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coalseam gas properties the effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments to state tax liabilities in addition 2000 benefited from investments in coalseam gas properties the 2003 effective rate may benefit from the resolution of various tax audits

 

in march 2002 the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 was signed into law and began providing immediate tax incentives for business a 30 additional firstyear depreciation allowance was a primary element of this legislation this depreciation incentive continues for three years and during these years the resulting acceleration of tax depreciation deductions will improve cash flow by reducing current tax expense and increasing deferred tax expense by significant amounts

discontinued operations 

 

income from discontinued operations in 2001 consisted of a 13 million aftertax gain related to the sale of ns motor carrier subsidiary see note 17

 

 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash provided by operating activities ns principal source of liquidity was 803 million in 2002 compared with 654 million in 2001 and 13 billion in 2000 in 2002 the improvement was the result of higher income from railway operations and favorable changes in working capital which were offset in part by fewer accounts receivable sold see note 5 receivable sales declined 270 million in 2002 and 88 million in 2001 the significant decline in operating cash flow in 2001 reflects the commencement in 2000 of the accounts receivable sales program excluding the infusion of cash in 2000 from the start of this program operating cash flow declined by 300 million in 2001 the decrease primarily resulted from an 88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable sold higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years an increase in telecommunication receivables bonus payments in 2001 no such payments in 2000 and the timing of payrolls

 

a significant portion of payments made to prr which are included in conrail rents and services and therefore are a use of cash in cash provided by operating activities are borrowed back from a prr subsidiary and therefore are a source of cash in proceeds from borrowings ns net cash flow from these borrowings amounted to 212 million in 2002 and 250 million in 2001

 

ns working capital deficit was 554 million at dec 31 2002 compared with 13 billion at dec 31 2001 the decline resulted principally from the change in the terms of the note under which ns borrows funds from a subsidiary of prr see note 2 and a reduction in the amount of debt due within one year debt due in 2003 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations including sales of accounts receivable and cash on hand

 

ns currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more immediate working capital needs during 2002 the amount of receivables ns could sell under this program ranged from 368 million to 421 million and the amount of receivables ns sold ranged from 30 million to 400 million moreover ns has the capability to issue up to 1 billion of commercial paper see note 8 however reductions in its credit ratings could limit ns ability to access the commercial paper markets see also the discussion of financing activities below

 

ns expects to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its ongoing obligations this expectation is based on a view that the economy will remain flat for the first half of 2003 and resume growth in the third and fourth quarters

 

 

k25

contractual obligations at dec 31 2002 related to ns longterm debt including capital leases operating leases agreements with crc unconditional purchase obligations and other longterm obligations are as follows

 

  

ns also has contractual obligations to prr as disclosed in note 2 however ns has the ability to borrow back funds from prr to the extent they are not needed to fund contractual obligations at conrail as an indirect owner of conrail ns may need to make capital contributions loans or advances to conrail to fund its contractual obligations the following table presents 58 of conrails contractual obligations for longterm debt including capital leases and operating leases conrail has no unconditional purchase or other longterm obligations

 

  

ns also has two transactions not included in the balance sheets or in the previous table of its contractual obligations consisting of an accounts receivable sale program see note 5 and an operating lease covering 140 locomotives see note 9

 

under the accounts receivable sale program ns sells without recourse undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two unrelated buyers ns has no ownership interest in the buyers the buyers issued debt to fund their initial purchase and ns used the proceeds it received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding debt ns has no obligation related to the buyers debt and there is no existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables upon termination of the program the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and would retain collections related to the previously sold receivables see note 5

 

the operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually at ns option and expires in 2008 the lessor is a specialpurpose entity formed to enter into this transaction but it is not related to ns and its owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the entity the lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their purchase ns has no obligation related to the debt ns has the option to purchase the locomotives but also can return them to the lessor the return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this option if ns does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum lease term it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the locomotives and a specified residual value ns does not expect to be required to make any payments

 

 

k26

under this provision see note 9 as the primary beneficiary of the business of the lessor effective

jan 1 2003 ns consolidated the assets locomotives and liabilities debt of this specialpurpose entity when it implemented financial accounting standards board interpretation no 46 see new accounting pronouncement on page k34

 

cash used for investing activities increased 12 in 2002 and 3 in 2001 property additions which account for most of the recurring spending in this category were down 8 in 2002 following a 2 increase in 2001 property sales were significantly lower in 2002 which resulted in the net increase in cash used for investing activities despite the reduction in capital spending the following tables show capital spending including capital leases and track and equipment statistics for the past five years

 

  

capital expenditures which in 2002 included 6 million of capitalized leases decreased 7 in 2002 but increased 2 in 2001 the decline in 2002 reflected lower spending for intermodal facilities as ns completed in 2001 several significant projects that expanded the capacity of the intermodal network higher spending on track program work was offset by fewer locomotive purchases 50 in 2002 compared with 100 in 2001 outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases no such purchases were made in 2000 as locomotives were leased that were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases and roadway projects in 2002 2001 and 2000 spending for road included fiberoptic infrastructure see telecommunications subsidiary below

 

 

  

the table above excludes equipment leased from prr see note 2 which comprises 17 of the freight car fleet and 25 of the locomotive fleet

 

through its coal car rebody program which was suspended in 2000 ns converted about 29000 hopper cars into highcapacity steel gondolas or hoppers as a result the remaining service life of the freightcar fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age shown in the table above

 

 

k27

for 2003 ns has budgeted 798 million for capital expenditures the anticipated spending includes 499 million for roadway projects of which 383 million is for track and bridge program work also included are projects for communications signal and electrical systems as well as projects for environmental and public improvements such as grade crossing separations and signal upgrades other roadway projects include marketing and industrial development initiatives including increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution facilities and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure equipment spending of 246 million includes the purchase of 100 locomotives and upgrades to existing units improvements to multilevel automobile racks and projects related to computers and information technology including additional security and backup systems

 

cash used for financing activities in 2002 was 150 million financing activities provided cash of 151 million in 2001 and used cash of 798 million in 2000 the comparisons reflect a net reduction of debt in 2002 a net increase in 2001 and a net reduction in 2000 the comparison in 2001 also reflected the effects of the reduction to the dividend in january 2001 financing activities include loan transactions with a subsidiary of prr that resulted in net borrowings of 212 million in 2002 and 250 million in 2001 and net repayments of 72 million in 2000 see note 2 excluding these borrowings debt was reduced 303 million in 2002 20 million in 2001 and 422 million in 2000 the net reduction of debt in 2000 was accomplished in part with the proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable ns debttototal capitalization ratio excluding notes payable to the prr subsidiary at year end was 531 in 2002 and 556 in 2001

 

ns currently has in place a 1 billion fiveyear credit agreement which provides for borrowings at prevailing rates and includes financial covenants see note 8

 

ns has outstanding 717 million of its 705 notes due may 1 2037 each holder of a 2037 note may require ns to redeem all or part of the note at face value plus accrued and unpaid interest on may 1 2004 ns will not know the amount of 2037 notes that it may be required to redeem until april 1 2004 ns expects to be able to redeem any such notes using cash generated from operations including sales of accounts receivable cash on hand and proceeds from borrowings

 

 

application of critical accounting estimates 

 

the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period these estimates and assumptions may require significant judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain and future events are likely to occur that may require management to change them accordingly management regularly reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances management discusses the development selection and disclosures concerning critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors

 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefit plans requires management to make several estimates and assumptions see note 11 these include the expected rate of return from investment of the plans assets projected increases in medical costs and the expected retirement age of employees as well as their projected earnings and mortality in addition the amounts recorded are affected by changes in the interest rate environment because the associated liabilities are discounted to their present value management makes these estimates based on the companys historical experience and other information that it deems pertinent under the circumstances for example expectations of future stock market performance management engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid it in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing its related liabilities

 

 

k28

ns net pension benefit which is included in compensation and benefits on its consolidated income statement was 79 million for the year ended dec 31 2002 in recording this amount ns assumed a longterm investment rate of return of 9 compared with the 10 rate used in the previous two years investment experience of the pension fund over the past 10 15 and 20year periods has been in excess of 10 a one percentage point change to this rate of return assumption would result in a 20 million change to the pension credit and as a result an equal change in compensation and benefits expense changes that are reasonably likely to occur in assumptions concerning retirement age projected earnings and mortality would not be expected to have a material effect on ns net pension benefit or net pension asset in the future the net pension asset is recorded at its net present value using a discount rate that is based on the current interest rate environment therefore management has little discretion in this assumption

 

ns net cost for other postretirement benefits which is also included in compensation and benefits was 34 million for the year ended dec 31 2002 in recording this expense and valuing the net liability for other postretirement benefits which is included in other benefits as disclosed in note 11 management estimated future increases in healthcare costs these assumptions along with the effect of a one percentage point change in them are described in note 11

 

properties and depreciation 

 

most of ns total assets are comprised of longlived railway properties see note 6 and its investment in conrail see note 2 most of conrails assets are longlived railway properties as disclosed in note 1 ns properties are depreciated using group depreciation rail is depreciated primarily on the basis of use measured by grosston miles other properties are depreciated generally using the straightline method over the lesser of estimated service or lease lives ns reviews the carrying amount of properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying amount may not be recoverable based on future undiscounted cash flows or estimated net realizable value assets that are deemed impaired as a result of such review are recorded at the lesser of carrying amount or fair value ns is amortizing the excess of the purchase price paid for its investment in conrail over its share of conrails net equity using the principles of purchase accounting based primarily on the estimated remaining useful lives of conrails properties

 

ns depreciation expense is based on managements assumptions concerning service lives of its properties as well as the expected net salvage that will be received upon their retirement these assumptions are the product of periodic depreciation studies that are performed by a firm of consulting engineers these studies analyze ns historical patterns of asset use and retirement and take into account any expected change in operation or maintenance practices ns recent experience with these studies has been that while they do result in changes in the rates used to depreciate its properties these changes have not caused a significant effect to its annual depreciation expense the studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by the study any such deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the affected class of property ns depreciation expense for the year ended dec 31 2002 amounted to 515 million ns weightedaverage depreciation rates for 2002 are disclosed in note 6 a onetenth percentage point increase or decrease in these rates would result in a 17 million increase or decrease to ns depreciation expense

 

personal injury environmental and legal liabilities 

 

ns expense for casualties and other claims amounted to 171 million for the year ended dec 31 2002 most of this expense was composed of ns accrual related to personal injury liabilities see discussion of fela in the discussion captioned casualties and other claims on page k23 ns engages an independent consulting actuarial firm to aid in valuing its personal injury liability and determining the amount to accrue during the year the actuarial firm studies ns historical patterns of reserving for claims and subsequent settlements the actuary also takes into account outside influences considered pertinent the study uses the results of these analyses to estimate the ultimate amount of the liability which includes amounts for incurred but unasserted claims ns has recorded this actuarially determined liability the liability is dependent upon many individual judgments made as to the specific case reserves as well as the judgments of the consulting

 

 

k29

actuary and management in the periodic studies accordingly there could be significant changes in the liability which ns would recognize when such a change became known the most recent actuarial study was performed as of june 30 2002 and resulted in an increase to ns personal injury liability during the third quarter while the liability recorded is supported by the most recent study it is reasonably possible that the liability could be higher or lower

 

ns is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and regulations it is ns policy to record a liability where such liability or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably see note 18 environmental engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all known sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to liability estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy

 

operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately 15 million in 2002 12 million in 2001 and 11 million in 2000 and capital expenditures totaled approximately 10 million in each of 2002 2001 and 2000 capital expenditures in 2003 are expected to be comparable to those in 2002

 

ns balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in the amount of 29 million at dec 31 2002 and 33 million at dec 31 2001 of which 8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year at dec 31 2002 the liability represented ns estimate of the probable cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 114 identified locations on that date 10 sites accounted for 16 million of the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years however some costs will be paid out over a longer period

 

at some of the 114 locations certain ns subsidiaries usually in conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state statutes which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs

 

with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns ultimate potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all such sites are necessarily imprecise because of the widely varying costs of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of any estimated loss and that participants ability to bear it and evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability ns estimates its environmental remediation liability on a sitebysite basis using assumptions and judgments that management deems appropriate for each site as a result it is not practical to quantitatively discuss the effects of changes in these many assumptions and judgments ns has consistently applied its methodology of estimating its environmental liabilities

 

the risk of incurring environmental liability – for acts and omissions past present and future – is inherent in the railroad business some of the commodities in ns traffic mix particularly those classified as hazardous materials can pose special risks that ns and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize in addition several ns subsidiaries own or have owned land used as operating property or which is leased or may have been leased and operated by others or held for sale because environmental problems may exist on these properties that are latent or undisclosed there can be no assurance that ns will not incur environmentally related liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them the amount and materiality of which cannot be estimated reliably at this time moreover lawsuits and claims involving these and potentially other nowunidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to arise from time to time the resulting liabilities could have a significant effect on financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter

 

however based on its assessment of the facts and circumstances now known management believes that it has recorded the probable costs for dealing with those environmental matters of which the corporation is aware further management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity

 

 

 

k30

norfolk southern and certain subsidiaries are defendants in numerous lawsuits and other claims relating principally to railroad operations when management concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated it is accrued through a charge to expenses while the ultimate amount of liability incurred in any of these lawsuits and claims is dependent on future developments in managements opinion the recorded liability if any is adequate to cover the future payment of such liability and claims however the final outcome of any of these lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and unfavorable or unexpected outcomes could result in additional accruals that could be significant to results of operations in a particular year or quarter any adjustments to recorded liability will be reflected in expenses in the periods in which such adjustments are known

 

income taxes 

 

ns net deferred tax liability totaled 3010 million at dec 31 2002 see note 4 this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expenses in the corporate income tax returns for state income and other taxes judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions a valuation allowance is recorded if management expects that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized ns has only a 24 million valuation allowance on 592 million of deferred tax assets as of dec 31 2002 reflecting the expectation that most of these assets will be realized for 2002 2001 and 2000 the effective tax rates excluding ns equity in conrails earnings were 38 38 and 34 respectively for every 12 change in the 2002 effective tax rate net income would have changed by 4 million

 

 

conrails results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

 

conrails net income was 180 million in 2002 compared with 174 million in 2001 and 170 million in 2000 see note 2 the increase in 2002 was primarily the result of a favorable federal tax settlement the improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims expenses a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and environmental and insurance settlements in conrails favor these positive items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale of property

 

conrails operating revenues were 893 million in 2002 903 million in 2001 and 985 million in 2000 both decreases resulted from the expiration of certain equipment leases and lower operating fees largely because of reduced operating costs in the shared assets areas the decline in 2001 also reflected lower revenues at conrails indiana harbor belt subsidiary

 

conrails operating expenses were 623 million in 2002 639 million in 2001 and 749 million in 2000 the decrease in 2002 reflected lower expenses for materials services and rents and compensation and benefits which were offset in part by higher costs for casualties and other claims the decline in 2001 was primarily due to lower expenses for materials services and rents casualties and other claims and compensation and benefits

 

conrails cash provided by operations decreased 79 million or 16 in 2002 and increased 140 million or 39 in 2001 the decline in 2002 was primarily the result of the absence of two items that benefited 2001 a 50 million cash payment for transferring to a third party certain rights to license manage and market signboard advertising on conrails property for 25 years and proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement this was offset in part by favorable changes in working capital the increase in 2001 was largely the result of the two unusual items discussed above cash generated from operations is conrails principal source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital expenditures debt repayments totaled 59 million in 2002 and 61 million in 2001 capital expenditures totaled 23 million in 2002 and 47 million in 2001

 

 

k31

conrail had a working capital deficit of 29 million at dec 31 2002 compared with working capital of 438 million at dec 31 2001 which included 687 million of amounts receivable from ns and csx conrail is not an sec registrant and therefore presently cannot issue any publicly traded securities conrail is expected to have sufficient cash flow to meet its ongoing obligations

 

ns equity in earnings of conrail net of amortization was 54 million in 2002 44 million in 2001 and 21 million in 2000 ns other comprehensive loss for 2002 and 2001 as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity included 34 million and 41 million respectively for its portion of conrails other comprehensive loss see note 13

 

 

other matters 

 

telecommunications subsidiary 

 

ns subsidiary thoroughbred technology and telecommunications inc tcubed has developed fiber optic infrastructure with members of the telecommunications industry this industry has experienced a severe downturn as a result of changes in the values of telecommunications assets tcubed is monitoring its carrying amount of these assets as required by sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets to date based on known facts and circumstances management believes that its ultimate investment in these assets will be recovered and accordingly no impairment has been recognized see note 6

 

during 2001 one of tcubeds codevelopers 360networks usainc 360 filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and foreign laws 360 owes tcubed amounts for work performed on certain joint projects and tcubed owes 360 amounts for work performed on other joint projects the bankruptcy judge has approved setoff of these amounts leaving about 7 million due to tcubed from 360 tcubed has the right to collect this amount from any proceeds due 360 from the sale of joint assets management believes that it will collect this receivable

 

tcubed is engaged in contract litigation with a second codeveloper williams communications llc williams communications concerning the latters obligation to purchase fiber optic infrastructure installed by tcubed between cleveland ohio and northern virginia on jan 29 2003 the united states district court for the northern district of georgia entered an order requiring williams communications to pay tcubed the remaining amount due for such infrastructure approximately 36 million plus prejudgment interest at a rate of 9 per annum williams communications may elect to appeal the ability to collect and retain a judgment against williams communications may be limited due to its financial condition however the shortfall if any cannot now be determined its parent williams communications group inc filed in april 2002 a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and emerged from bankruptcy in october 2002 williams communications was not included in the bankruptcy petition see note 18

 

labor arbitration 

 

several hundred claims have been filed with nsr on behalf of employees furloughed after june 1 1999 for various periods of time alleging that the furloughs were a result of the conrail transaction and seeking new york dock income protection benefits several labor organizations have initiated arbitration on behalf of individual employees other disputes are pending wherein similar benefits are sought under labor agreement provisions that in managements judgment do not apply to the involved circumstances

 

based on known facts including the availability of legal defenses management believes that ns will prevail in these disputes and that any potential liability for the involved claims should not have a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity depending on the outcome of these arbitrations additional claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration should all such claimants prevail there could be a significant effect on results of operations in a particular quarter see note 18

 

 

k32

labor agreements 

 

approximately 24000 of ns railroad employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with 15 different labor unions these agreements remain in effect until changed pursuant to the railway labor act moratorium provisions in these agreements permitted ns and the unions to propose such changes in late 1999 negotiations at the national level commenced shortly thereafter the outcome of these negotiations is uncertain at this time however agreements have been reached with the brotherhood of maintenance of way employes bmwe which represents about 4200 ns employees the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble which represents about 4500 ns employees the united transportation union utu which represents about 6700 ns employees the international brotherhood of boilermakers and blacksmiths ibb which represents about 100 ns employees and the transportation communications international union tcu which represents about 4400 ns employees health and welfare issues have been resolved with bmwe and tcu the utu agreement provides that subsequent to a further period of negotiation health and welfare issues may be submitted to arbitration health and welfare issues with the other organizations have not yet been resolved

 

market risks and hedging activities 

 

ns uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates

 

in 2001 ns began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel consumption the intent of the program is to assist in the management of ns aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations which can significantly affect ns operating margins and profitability through the use of one or more types of derivative instruments

 

diesel fuel costs represented 7 of ns operating expenses for 2002 the program provides that ns will not enter into any fuel hedges with a duration of more than 36 months and that no more than 80 of ns average monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for any month within any 36month period

 

as of dec 31 2002 through swap transactions ns has hedged approximately 62 of expected 2003 diesel fuel requirements the effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of 73 cents per hedged gallon including federal taxes and transportation a 10 decrease in diesel fuel prices would reduce ns asset related to the swaps by approximately 30 million as of dec 31 2002

 

ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments and by entering into interestrate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix within its debt portfolio

 

at dec 31 2002 ns debt subject to interest rate fluctuations totaled 784 million excluding debt due to the prr subsidiary a 1 increase in interest rates would increase ns total annual interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately 8 million management considers it unlikely that interest rate fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations or liquidity

 

some of ns capital leases which carry an average fixed rate of 7 were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest rate swap agreements on dec 31 2002 the average pay rate under these agreements was 21 and the average receive rate was 7 during 2002 the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by 9 million a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen ns eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yendenominated obligation most of these deposits are held by foreign banks primarily japanese as a result ns is exposed to financial market risk relative to japan counterparties to the interest rate swaps and japanese banks holding yen deposits are major financial institutions believed by management to be creditworthy

the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 143 which is effective jan 1 2003 and addresses legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs in accordance with the uniform system of accounts for railroad companies see code of federal regulations title 49 subtitle b chapter x part 1201 ns depreciates track structure rail other track material and ties to its net salvage value gross salvage less cost to remove sfas no 143 prohibits the accrual of a liability for removal costs absent a legal obligation to remove the related asset management believes that there is no such legal obligation to remove track the sec staff has recently taken a position with a registrant in another industry that calls into question whether the use of net salvage that results in depreciating more than the cost basis of an asset negative salvage is appropriate once sfas no 143 becomes effective ns is in the process of studying its track accounts to determine where current depreciation rates will result in negative salvage to the extent that ns accumulated depreciation includes such amounts they will be removed the cumulative effect of this catchup adjustment will be recorded as a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2003 going forward this change will result in lower depreciation expense because the depreciation rate will no longer reflect any negative salvage and higher compensation and benefits expenses for the labor cost to remove retired assets ns does not expect that this will result in a material change to its total railway operating expenses

 

the fasb has issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 46 which addresses consolidation of certain variable interest entities also commonly referred to as special purpose entities ns adopted fin no 46 effective jan 1 2003 as a result on that date ns consolidated a specialpurpose entity that leases certain locomotives to ns see note 9 this entity has no other significant assets or liabilities other than the locomotives and the debt related to their purchase which will be reflected on ns consolidated balance sheet in 2003 this change in reporting will also have the following effects to ns consolidated income statement beginning in 2003 operating lease expense will decline and depreciation expense and interest expense on debt will increase the net effect of these income statement changes is not significant adoption of fin no 46 did not have a significant effect on ns financial position or liquidity

 

inflation 

 

generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical cost in preparing financial statements this approach disregards the effects of inflation on the replacement cost of property ns a capitalintensive company has most of its capital invested in such assets the replacement cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of historical cost

 

trends 

 

federal economic regulation  efforts may be made in 2003 to reimpose unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry the staggers rail act of 1980 which substantially reduced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business ns and other rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted economic regulation

 

utility deregulation  deregulation of the electrical utility industry is expected to increase competition among electric power generators deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from distant parties the effects of deregulation on ns and on its customers cannot be predicted with certainty however ns serves a number of efficient power producers who are expected to remain competitive in this evolving environment

 

carbonbased fuel  there is growing concern in some quarters that emissions resulting from burning carbonbased fuel including coal are contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes to the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policymakers the impact could be

 

 

k34

either a reduction in the demand for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions which might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation or make permitting of coalfired facilities even more difficult the revenues and net income of nsr and other railroads that move large quantities of coal could be affected adversely

	freight rates  in 2001 ns railroads continued their reliance on
private contracts and exempt price quotes as their predominant pricing
mechanisms  thus a major portion of ns railroads freight business is
not currently economically regulated by the government  in general
market forces have been substituted for government regulation and now are
the primary determinant of rail service prices

	in 2001 ns railroads were found by the stb not to be revenue
adequate based on results for the year 2000  a railroad is revenue
adequate under the applicable law when its return on net investment
exceeds the rail industrys composite cost of capital

	passenger operations  regularly scheduled passenger trains are
operated by amtrak on ns lines between alexandria and new orleans and
between greensboro and selma north carolina  commuter trains are
operated on the ns line between manassas and alexandria under
contract with two transportation commissions of the commonwealth of
virginia  ns also leases the chicago to manhattan illinois line to
the commuter rail division of the regional transportation authority of
northeast illinois  since june 1 1999 norfolk southern railway has
operated former conrail lines on which amtrak conducts regularly

                                     12

scheduled passenger operations between chicago illinois and detroit
michigan and between chicago and harrisburg pennsylvania

	also since june 1 1999 through its operation of prrs routes
norfolk southern railway has been providing freight service over former
conrail lines with significant ongoing amtrak and commuter passenger
operations and is conducting freight operations over some trackage
owned by amtrak or by new jersey transit the southeastern
pennsylvania transportation authority metronorth commuter railway
company and maryland dot  finally passenger operations are
conducted either by amtrak or by the commuter agencies over trackage
owned by pennsylvania lines llc or by conrail in the shared
assets areas

	noncarrier operations  ns noncarrier subsidiaries engage
principally in telecommunications the acquisition leasing and
management of coal oil gas and minerals the development of commercial
real estate and the leasing or sale of rail property and equipment
in 2001 no such noncarrier subsidiary or industry segment grouping of
noncarrier subsidiaries met the requirements for a reportable business
segment set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 131

dec 31 2001 was 254 years  during 2001 4407 freight cars were
retired since 1988 about 29000 coal cars have been rebodied  as a
result the remaining serviceability of the freight car fleet is greater

	ongoing freight car and locomotive maintenance programs are intended
to ensure the highest standards of safety reliability customer satisfaction
and equipment marketability  in past years the freight car bad order ratio
reflected the storage of certain types of cars that were not in high demand
the ratio had declined more recently as a result of a disposition program
for underutilized unserviceable and overage revenue cars  the ratio rose
in 2000 and 2001 as a result of decreased maintenance activity  the
locomotive bad order ratio also includes units out of service for routine
maintenance and modifications  the increase in the locomotive bad order
ratio in 1999 was primarily due to the maintenance requirements of units
being rented to meet shortterm needs and to weatherrelated failures
the ratio remained high in 2000 as maintenance activities were curtailed
in response to a slowing economy  the higher ratio in 2001 reflected units
out of service related to the resumption of maintenance and modification
activities

	trackage  all ns trackage is standard gauge and the rail in
approximately 97 percent of the main line trackage including first second
third and branch main tracks all excluding trackage rights ranges from
100 to 155 pounds per yard  of the approximately 31300 miles of track

	government regulation  in addition to environmental safety
securities and other regulations generally applicable to all businesses
ns railroads are subject to regulation by the stb which succeeded the
icc on jan 1 1996  the stb has jurisdiction over some rates routes
conditions of service and the extension or abandonment of rail lines
the stb also has jurisdiction over the consolidation merger or acquisition
of control of and by rail common carriers  the department of transportation
regulates certain track and mechanical equipment standards

	the relaxation of economic regulation of railroads begun over two
decades ago by the icc under the staggers rail act of 1980 has continued
under the stb  significant exemptions are tofccofc ie piggyback
business rail boxcar traffic lumber manufactured steel automobiles and
certain bulk commodities such as sand gravel pulpwood and wood chips for
paper manufacturing  transportation contracts on regulated shipments
effectively remove those shipments from regulation as well  about
75 percent of ns freight revenues come from either exempt traffic or
traffic moving under transportation contracts

	efforts may be made in 2002 to resubject the rail industry to
unwarranted federal economic regulation  the staggers rail act of 1980
which substantially reduced such regulation encouraged and enabled rail
carriers to innovate and to compete for business thereby contributing to
the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the
industry  accordingly ns will oppose efforts to reimpose unwarranted
economic regulation

	competition  there is continuing strong competition among rail
water and highway carriers  price is usually only one factor of
importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific
hauling company  inventory carrying costs service reliability ease of
handling and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also
important considerations especially for highervalued finished goods
machinery and consumer products  even for raw materials semifinished
goods and workinprocess users are increasingly sensitive to transport
arrangements which minimize problems at successive production stages

	ns primary rail competitor is the csx system both operate
throughout much of the same territory  other railroads also operate in
parts of the territory  ns also competes with motor carriers water
carriers and with shippers who have the additional option of handling
their own goods in private carriage

	certain cooperative strategies between railroads and between
railroads and motor carriers enable carriers to compete more
effectively in specific markets

                   managements discussion and analysis of
                  financial condition and results of operations


the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the consolidated financial statements and notes beginning on page 51
and the fiveyear financial review beginning on page 23

summarized results of operations

2001 compared with 2000

	net income in 2001 was 375 million up 118 results in 2001
included a 13 million gain related to the 1998 sale of ns former motor
carrier subsidiary see note 17 on page 79 income from continuing
operations which excludes that gain was 362 million up 110  results
in 2000 included 165 million of costs related to actions taken to reduce
the size of the work force which reduced income from continuing operations
by 101 million or 26 cents per diluted share excluding these costs
income from continuing operations increased 89 million or 33 in 2001
the improvement resulted from higher income from railway operations which
was up 209 million or 26 that more than offset lower nonoperating
income which was down 69 million see note 3 on page 61
	diluted earnings per share were 97 cents up 116 diluted earnings
per share from continuing operations were 94 cents up 109 excluding
the workforce reduction costs in 2000 diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations were up 32

2000 compared with 1999

	results for 2000 reflected the first full year of operations over
conrails lines on june 1 1999 the closing date ns railroad
subsidiary norfolk southern railway company nsr began operating a
substantial portion of conrails properties substantially all of which
comprise nsrs northern region under various agreements with pennsylvania
lines llc prr a wholly owned subsidiary of consolidated rail corporation
crc see note 2 on page 58 as a result both the railroad route miles
operated by nsr and the number of its railroad employees increased by
approximately 50 on that date results for 1999 reflect five months
january through may of operating the former norfolk southern railroad
system and seven months june through december of operating the present
system which includes the northern region
	results in 1999 were adversely affected by difficulties encountered
in the assimilation of the northern region into nsrs existing system that
resulted in system congestion an increase in cars on line increased
terminal dwell time and reduced system velocity these service issues
and actions taken to address them increased operating expenses primarily
labor costs and equipment costs including car hire and locomotive rentals
moreover revenues were lower than expected as some customers diverted
traffic to other modes of transportation

item 7     managements discussion and analysis of financial
      
            condition and results of operations continued
            

	net income in 2000 was 172 million down 28 excluding the
101 million aftertax cost of the workforce reductions net income
would have been 273 million up 14 the increase resulted from gains
from the sale of nonoperating properties see note 3 on page 61 and
higher income from railway operations compared with a weak 1999
	diluted earnings per share were 45 cents down 29 excluding the
effects of the workforce reduction costs diluted earnings per share
were up 13

detailed results of operations

railway operating revenues

	railway operating revenues were 62 billion in both 2001 and 2000
and were 52 billion in 1999 revenues in 1999 include results of
operations in the northern region for seven months the following table

	revenue per unit increased in all market groups principally due to
rate increases use of highercapacity equipment and favorable changes in
the mix of traffic
	in 2000 revenues increased for all market groups reflecting a full
year of handling northern region traffic revenues improved for the last
seven months a comparison that fully includes the northern region in both
years reflecting recovery of most of the diverted traffic and new business
however weakness in the economy resulted in lower revenues very late in the
year revenue per unit improved in most market groups principally due to the
effects of northern region traffic and increased rates about half of the
revenue per unit increase for the intermodal market group was attributable to
the effects of the consolidation of triple crown services company tcs
revenues see discussion of intermodal revenues below

	coal tonnage increased 2 in 2001 and revenues increased 6 revenue per
unit increased 6 a result of rate increases including lower volumerelated
refunds on export coal shipments gains in tonnage per car and favorable
changes to the mix of traffic less shorterhaul business coal coke and
iron ore revenues represented 25 of total railway operating revenues in 2001
and 83 of ns coal shipments originated on lines it operated
	in 2000 coal tonnage increased 11 and revenues increased 9
reflecting a full year of northern region traffic revenue per unit declined
a result of a higher proportion of traffic with a shorter length of haul
principally attributable to a full year of northern region operations

	utility coal traffic increased 11 in 2001 reflecting higher demand
for coalfired electricity and the effects of very high natural gas prices
early in the year high demand for electricity a volatile market for
natural gas and production problems at a number of large mines in the east
late in 2000 combined to increase the demand for coal early in 2001 with a
resulting increase in coal prices utility coal traffic volume also
benefited from the shifting of coal that traditionally would have been
bound for export to the domestic market
	in 2000 utility coal traffic increased 11 reflecting a full year
of northern region operations the effects of expanded operations were
somewhat offset by coal production problems at several nsserved mines
unanticipated outages at some nsserved utility plants large stockpiles
at the beginning of the year and mild summer weather in portions of ns
service territory
	the nearterm outlook for utility coal remains positive us
demand for electricity continues to grow rapidly and coalfired
generation remains the cheapest marginal source of electricity several
underutilized coalfired power plants are making the transition

from peakonly generation to fulltime generation in addition although
natural gas prices have returned to more normal levels the volatility of
natural gas prices may improve the longterm competitive position of
coalfired generation
	phase ii of title iv of the clean air act amendments of 1990 which
imposes more stringent limits on sulfur dioxide emissions took effect on
jan 1 2000 many of the mines served by ns produce coals that satisfy
phase ii requirements in addition substantial banks of sulfur dioxide
allowances held by many nsserved utilities should continue to provide a
market for other nsserved mines for many years however several federal
environmental regulatory initiatives continued to be pursued during 2001
including new source review for older coalfired plants many of the
rules that have been promulgated to date are in litigation if the rules
survive litigation and are implemented they could increase the cost
of coalfired generation and potentially adversely affect the value of
the sulfur dioxide allowance bank
	the bush administration rejected in 2001 the kyoto protocol and
withdrew us participation in that process if implemented the proposed
kyoto limits on greenhouse gases could have put additional cost pressures
on coalfired generation the us withdrawal from the kyoto process has
renewed interest in building coalfired generation plants
	the 1999 decision by a federal district court judge in west virginia
holding that some common mountaintop mining practices in the coal industry
are illegal was overturned in april 2001 by the us fourth circuit
court of appeals in january 2002 the us supreme court refused to
hear an appeal of the case

	export coal tonnage declined 30 in 2001 the rapid rise of domestic
utility coal prices early in the year enticed many foreignmarket
suppliers to place much of their 2001 production in the domestic utility
markets in addition production difficulties at several large nsserved
mines and flooding in west virginia in july significantly reduced the
supply of low volatile coal the combination of these factors resulted
in most of the decline in shipments of export coal steam coal exported
through baltimore declined 32 and export metallurgical coals through
norfolk declined by 30 demand for steam coal to export strengthened
in the last half of 2001 however the strong us demand limited ns
participation in this market demand for coking coal to export continued
to soften as steel production moved from traditional ns markets in
europe to asia which in recent years has been supplied by australian
or canadian coals
	in 2000 export coal tonnage increased 8 a result of a full year
of access to baltimore through the northern region mitigated by lower
tonnage through norfolk several additional factors also adversely
affected export coal traffic volume delayed settlements between buyers
and sellers in the spring postponed shipments of some export tonnage
foreign buyers ultimately intended to purchase additional us
metallurgical coal but production capacity available for export had
been diminished by two years of dramatically lower prices toward the
end of 2000 production difficulties at several large nsserved mines
significantly reduced tonnage available for export limited supplies
overall prevented other coal producers from providing substitute coal
	export coal tonnage is expected to continue to be limited by supply
and subject to the fluctuations of the world market while the
consolidation of australian producers should help stabilize that supply
channel new australian production could displace us

volumes to europe absent any increase in demand moreover chinese
participation in pacific rim markets could displace australian coals there
and force that tonnage to europe

	domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore traffic decreased 18
in 2001 due to a decline in the market for domestic steel the softening
economy and an increase in steel imports drastically cut blast furnace
production sharply reducing the demand for coking coal iron ore and coke
the increase in imported steel also resulted in lower prices that put
pressure on the us steel industry and led to plant closures and
bankruptcies that included some ns customers
	in 2000 domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore traffic
increased 17 due to a full year of northern region operations in
addition increased production in the first half of the year and gains
in ns market share contributed to the higher traffic however the
softening economy and increased steel imports diminished blast furnace
production rates sharply reducing demand for raw materials
	domestic metallurgical coal coke and iron ore traffic is expected
to continue to suffer from the decline in demand for domestically produced
steel however the united states has applied a tariff on imported coke
which has reduced its entry to the us market moreover the us
international trade commission has recommended that president bush take
similar action on imported steel but longterm demand is expected to
continue to decline due to advanced technologies that allow production of
steel using less coke

	other coal traffic principally steam coal shipped to manufacturing
plants increased 6 in 2001 and 4 in 2000 the gain in 2001 resulted from
new and increased business from industrial customers the increase in 2000
reflected a full year of handling northern region traffic however this
was mitigated by the loss of some traffic to competitors

production and the recapture of business diverted because of service issues
after the closing date the carload increase was less than the revenue
increase principally due to the effects of a redesign of the mixing center
network this redesign improves vehicle velocity through the network and
includes changes in traffic flows that resulted in a decline in carloads
with no corresponding decrease in revenues

	intermodal traffic volume decreased 1 but revenues increased slightly
in 2001 domestic traffic volume was up in the first half of the year but
demand increasingly weakened as the year progressed which eroded ns base
of traffic new business supported by the opening of three new terminals and
other initiatives mitigated the effects of the weakened economy international
traffic which accounts for about half of intermodal volume grew slightly as
us imports slowed with the economy tcs traffic volume increased 1 despite
economic conditions as it continued to benefit from reliable trucklike
service intermodal revenue per unit dropped later in the year reflecting the
expiration of fuel surcharges that were implemented late in 2000 and the
introduction of new shorterhaul business
	in 2000 intermodal traffic volume increased 18 and revenues
increased 32 primarily due to a full year of northern region traffic and
the consolidation of tcs revenues see note 2 on page 58 about half of the
improvement in revenue per unit resulted from the effects of consolidating
tcs prior to june 1 1999 ns revenues included only the amounts for rail
services it performed under contract to tcs but ns volume included most
tcs units also contributing to the revenueperunit improvement were rate
increases throughout the year on domestic business and the implementation
of fuel surcharges later in the year in addition increased demand new
business and improved service contributed to the gains as major customers
including ups jb hunt hub group and maersk increased volumes despite
weak demand in the first quarter and the loss in december 1999 of a major
customer ns had regained its market share by the second quarter domestic
and premium business volumes benefited from service improvements and

railway operating expenses

	railway operating expenses decreased 7 in 2001 but increased 22
in 2000 expenses in 2000 included 165 million of costs related to
actions taken to reduce the size of the work force excluding these costs
railway operating expenses decreased 4 in 2001 while carloads dropped 3
and increased 19 in 2000 on carloads that were 15 higher the higher
expense increase in 2000 reflected a full year of northern region
operations and sharply higher diesel fuel prices
	the railway operating ratio which measures the percentage of
railway operating revenues consumed by railway operating expenses was
837 in 2001 compared with 870 in 2000 excluding the workforce
reduction costs which increased the ratio 27 percentage points and
863 in 1999
	the decline in the 2001 ratio reflected the increase in revenue
per unit as well as reduced expenses that resulted from gains in efficiency
the increase in the 2000 ratio reflected the effects of a full year of
northern region operations and the sharp increase in diesel fuel prices
which more than offset the absence of the significant costs incurred in
1999 related to the service issues after the closing date in addition
the ratio was adversely affected by a change in traffic mix more
resourceintensive traffic such as automotive and intermodal and the
new traffic in the northern region coupled with the decrease in export
coal traffic

  includes 165 million of workforce reduction costs in 2000

	compensation and benefits represented 39 of total railway operating
expenses and decreased 10 in 2001 but increased 20 in 2000 both
comparisons reflect the 165 million of workforce reduction costs in 2000
excluding those costs compensation and benefits decreased 3 in 2001 but
increased 12 in 2000
	the 3 decline in 2001 reflected savings attributable to the reduced
size of the work force these savings were somewhat offset by higher wages
and benefit costs for union employees higher incentive compensation and
reduced pension income
	the 12 increase in 2000 was largely attributable to the effects of
a full year of expanded operations and higher wages and benefit costs for
union employees these increases were mitigated by higher pension income and
the absence of the 49 million incurred in 1999 for the special work
incentive program swip for union employees in the third quarter of 1999
pension income was higher in 2000 largely due to the transfer of assets
from the conrail pension plan after the closing date ns has substantial
unrecognized gains related to its overfunded pension plan amortization
of these gains will continue to be included in compensation and
benefits expenses see note 11 on page 68
	the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act which took
effect on jan 1 2002 provides for a phased reduction of the employers
portions of tier ii railroad retirement payroll taxes the phasein calls
for a reduction from 161 in 2001 to 156 in 2002 142 in 2003 and
131 in 2004 in addition the supplemental annuity tax was eliminated
these changes are expected to result in a 21 million reduction to payroll
tax expenses in 2002 the new law allows for investment of tier ii assets
in a diversified portfolio through the newly established national railroad
retirement investment trust the law also provides a mechanism for
automatic adjustment of tier ii payroll taxes should the trust assets
fall below a fouryear reserve or exceed a sixyear reserve

purchased from outside contractors including the net costs of operating
joint or leased facilities with other railroads and the net cost of
equipment rentals this category of expenses decreased slightly in 2001
but increased 13 in 2000
	in 2001 the effects of lower equipment rents were largely offset
by higher costs for purchased services including expenses for software
consulting and legal fees the increase in 2000 was mostly attributable
to the effects of a full year of northern region operations and the
consolidation of tcs and was mitigated by the absence of significant costs
incurred in 1999 related to the service issues encountered after the
closing date
	equipment rents which includes the cost to ns of using equipment
mostly freight cars owned by other railroads or private owners less the
rent paid to ns for the use of its equipment decreased 11 in 2001 but
increased 22 in 2000 the decline in 2001 was principally due to shorter
car cycle times that resulted in fewer car days on line and fewer freight
car and locomotive leases the 2000 increase was principally due to the
effects of a full year of expanded operations but was mitigated by a
favorable comparison for the last seven months as expenses in 1999 were
high due to the service issues encountered after the closing date
	locomotive and equipment repair costs increased in 2001 principally
due to renewed maintenance activity this trend is expected to continue in
2002 driven by higher expenses for freight car repairs in 2000
maintenance costs increased reflecting a full year of northern region
operations however the increase was tempered by reduced maintenance
activities a result of cost control efforts

	conrail rents and services a new category of expense beginning in
1999 arose from the expansion of operations on the closing date and
amounted to 421 million in 2001 478 million in 2000 and 311 million
in 1999 this item includes amounts due to prr and crc for use of their
operating properties and equipment and crcs operation of the shared assets
areas also included is ns equity in conrails net earnings since the
closing date plus the additional amortization related to the difference
between ns investment in conrail and its underlying equity see note 2

included a full year of operations over conrails lines compared with
seven months in 1999

	depreciation expense was up 2 in 2001 and 6 in 2000 increases in
both years were due to property additions reflecting substantial levels of
capital spending see note 1 properties on page 57 for ns depreciation

decline in the average price per gallon expenses in 2001 include 8 million
related to the hedging program initiated in the second quarter see market
risks and hedging activities below and note 16 on page 77 the increase

	the largest component of casualties and other claims expense is
personal injury costs in 2001 cases involving occupational injuries
comprised about 31 of the total employee injury cases settled and 15 of
the total settlement payments made injuries of this type are not generally
caused by a specific accident or event but rather result from a claimed
exposure over time many such claims are being asserted by former or
retired employees some of whom have not been actively employed in the
rail industry for decades ns continues to work actively to eliminate all
employee injuries and to reduce the associated costs
	the rail industry remains uniquely susceptible to litigation
involving jobrelated accidental injury and occupational claims because
of an outmoded law the federal employers liability act fela
originally passed in 1908 and applicable only to railroads this law
which covers employee claims for jobrelated injuries promotes an
adversarial claims environment and produces results that are
unpredictable and inconsistent the railroads have been unsuccessful
so far in efforts to persuade congress to replace fela with a nofault
workers compensation system
	ns maintains substantial amounts of commercial insurance for
potential thirdparty liability and property damage claims it also
retains reasonable levels of risk through selfinsurance

	other expenses decreased 13 in 2001 but increased 14 in 2000
the decline in 2001 was principally due to lower bad debt costs reduced
franchise and property taxes and lower travel and employeerelocation
expenses the increase in 2000 reflected a full year of northern region
operations and higher bad debt expense

other income  net

	other income  net was 99 million in 2001 168 million in 2000
and 115 million in 1999 see note 3 on page 61 the reduction in 2001
resulted from the absence of 101 million of gains that occurred in 2000
related to the sale of certain timber rights and gas and oil royalty and
working interests this was somewhat offset by lower interest accruals
on federal income tax liabilities and a 13 million gain from a
nonrecurring settlement results in 2001 also included an 18 million
gain from a large property sale that closed in december the increase in
2000 reflected the 101 million of gains mitigated by the commencement
of a program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving
basis see note 5 on page 63

income taxes

	income tax expense in 2001 was 191 million for an effective rate of
35 compared with effective rates of 31 in 2000 and 32 in 1999
excluding the equity in conrails aftertax earnings the effective rates
were 38 in 2001 and 34 in both 2000 and 1999
	the effective rate in 2001 was higher than that of 2000 and 1999
primarily due to dispositions of tax benefits related to coalseam gas
properties the effective rates in all three years benefited from favorable
adjustments upon filing the prior year tax returns and favorable adjustments
to state tax liabilities in addition both 2000 and 1999 benefited from
investments in coalseam gas properties
	in january 1995 the united states tax court issued a preliminary
decision that disallowed some of the tax benefits a subsidiary of ns
purchased from a third party pursuant to a safe harbor lease agreement in
1981 in january 2001 ns received payment from the third party in
accordance with indemnification provisions of the lease agreement

discontinued operations

	income from discontinued operations consisted of a 13 million
aftertax gain related to the sale of ns motor carrier subsidiary see

financial condition liquidity and capital resources

	cash provided by operating activities ns principal source of
liquidity was 654 million in 2001 compared with 13 billion in 2000
and 533 million in 1999 results in 2000 reflect the commencement of a
program under which accounts receivable are sold on a revolving basis
see note 5 on page 63 excluding the infusion of cash from this program
operating cash flow declined 300 million in 2001 the decrease primarily
resulted from an 88 million reduction in the amount of accounts receivable
sold higher tax payments including amounts applicable to prior years an
increase in telecommunication receivables bonus payments in 2001 no such
payments in 2000 and the timing of payrolls  a significant portion of
payments made to prr which are included in conrail rents and services
and therefore are a use of cash in cash provided by operating
activities are borrowed back from a prr subsidiary and therefore are
a source of cash in proceeds from borrowings  in 2001 ns net cash flow
from these borrowings amounted to 250 million  the improvement in cash
provided by operating activities in 2000 resulted primarily from favorable
changes in working capital including an improvement in collection of
accounts receivable a lengthening of accounts payable and the lack of
bonus payments
 	the large changes in accounts receivable and current liabilities
other than debt in the 1999 cash flow statement primarily resulted from
the commencement of operations in the northern region  in addition
collection of accounts receivable had slowed
	ns working capital deficit was 13 billion at dec 31 2001
compared with 10 billion at dec 31 2000 the increase resulted
principally from a higher amount of debt due within one year  debt due
in 2002 is expected to be paid using cash generated from operations
including sales of accounts receivable cash on hand and proceeds
from borrowings  part of the working capital deficit at dec 31 2001
arises from a 373 million balance in notes and accounts payable to
conrail that is not expected to be repaid in 2002

	ns currently has the capability to increase the amount of accounts
receivable being sold under the revolving sale program to meet its more
immediate working capital needs during 2001 the amount of receivables
ns could sell under this program ranged from 345 million to 468 million
and the amount of receivables ns sold ranged from 300 million to
402 million moreover ns has the capability to issue up to 1 billion
of commercial paper see note 8 on page 65 however any reduction in
its credit rating could limit ns ability to access the commercial paper
markets see also the discussion of financing activities below

	under the accounts receivable sale program ns sells without recourse
undivided ownership interests in a pool of accounts receivable to two
unrelated buyers  ns has no ownership interest in the buyers  the buyers
issued debt to fund their initial purchase and ns used the proceeds it
received from the initial purchase primarily to pay down its outstanding
debt  ns has no obligation related to the buyers debt and there is no
existing obligation to repurchase sold receivables  upon termination of
the program the buyers would cease purchasing new receivables and
collections related to the sold receivables would be retained by the buyers
	the operating lease covering the 140 locomotives is renewable annually
at ns option and expires in 2008  the lessor is not related to ns and its
owner has a substantive residual equity capital investment at risk in the
entity  the lessor owns the locomotives and issued debt to finance their
purchase  ns has no obligation related to the debt  ns has the option to
purchase the locomotives but also can return them to the lessor  the
return provisions of the lease are not so onerous as to preclude this
option  if ns does not purchase the locomotives at the end of the maximum
lease term it is liable for any shortfall in the then fair value of the
locomotives and a specified residual value  ns does not expect to be
required to make any payments under this provision

	cash used for investing activities increased slightly in 2001 but
decreased slightly in 2000 property additions were up 2 in 2001
following a large decline in 2000 that reflected the absence of
significant locomotive purchases as fleet additions were accomplished
by operating lease investing activities in 1999 included approximately
140 million more of borrowings against the net cash surrender value of
corporateowned life insurance than in 2000 property additions account

in 2000 outlays in 2001 included amounts for locomotive purchases that
were somewhat offset by lower expenditures for freight car purchases

	the table above excludes equipment leased from prr see note 2 on
page 58 which comprises 16 of the freight car fleet and 27 of the
locomotive fleet
	the higher average age of owned locomotives in 2000 reflects the fact
that locomotives leased in 2000 are not included in the statistic the 1998
decrease in the average age of retired locomotives resulted from a
disproportionate share of early retirements as well as retention of older
units in anticipation of the closing date
	through its coal car rebody program which was suspended in 2000
ns converted about 29000 hopper cars into highcapacity steel gondolas
or hoppers as a result the remaining service life of the freightcar
fleet is greater than may be inferred from the increasing average age
shown in the table above
	for 2002 ns has budgeted 705 million for capital expenditures
the anticipated spending includes 482 million for roadway projects of
which 366 million is for track and bridge program work also included
are projects for marketing and industrial development initiatives and
continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure equipment spending
of 173 million includes the purchase of 50 locomotives and upgrades to
existing units and projects related to computers and information
technology including additional security and backup systems  ns
issued in february 2002 debt secured by the locomotives

	cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was 151 million and

financing activities included loan transactions with a prr subsidiary that
resulted in net borrowings of 250 million in 2001 and net repayments of
72 million in 2000 see note 2 on page 58 excluding these borrowings
debt was reduced 20 million in 2001 and 422 million in 2000 the

conrails results of operations financial condition and liquidity

	through may 31 1999 conrails results of operations include freight
linehaul revenues and related expenses after the closing date june 1 1999
its results reflect its new structure and operations see note 2 on page 58
currently conrails major sources of operating revenues are operating fees
and rents from nsr and csxt the composition of conrails operating expenses
also changed
	conrails net income was 174 million in 2001 compared with
170 million in 2000 and 26 million in 1999 see note 2 on page 58 results
in 1999 included 180 million of expenses 121 million after taxes
principally to increase certain components of its casualty liability based
on an actuarial valuation to adjust certain litigation and environmental
liabilities related to settlements and completion of site reviews and a
credit adjustment related to the assumption of a lease obligation by csx
excluding the effects of these items net income would have been
147 million in 1999
	the improvement in 2001 reflected lower casualties and other claims
expenses a favorable adjustment to state income tax reserves and
environmental and insurance settlements in conrails favor these positive
items were offset in part by the absence of significant gains from the sale
of property the 2000 increase reflected a 37 million aftertax gain from
a property sale and the absence of significant transitionrelated expenses
	conrails operating revenues were 903 million in 2001 985 million
in 2000 and 22 billion in 1999  the decline in 2001 resulted from lower
revenues at conrails indiana harbor belt subsidiary the expiration of
certain equipment leases and lower operating fees largely because of
reduced operating costs in the shared assets areas the decline in 2000
was attributable to the change in operations
	conrails operating expenses were 639 million in 2001
749 million in 2000 and 20 billion in 1999 the decline in 2001 was
primarily due to lower expenses for materials services and rents
casualties and other claims and compensation and benefits the decrease
in 2000 was principally due to the change in operations and the absence
of the 180 million of expenses discussed above and 60 million of
transitionrelated expenses principally technology integration costs
and employee stay bonuses
	conrails cash provided by operations increased 140 million
or 39 in 2001 but decreased 34 million or 9 in 2000 the 2001
increase was principally due to a 50 million cash payment for
transferring to a third party certain rights to license manage and
market signboard advertising on conrails property for 25 years and
proceeds from a favorable insurance settlement the 2000 reduction
reflected the change in operations and payment of onetime items owed
to nsr and csxt cash generated from operations is conrails principal
source of liquidity and is primarily used for debt repayments and capital
expenditures debt repayments totaled 61 million in 2001 and 318 million
in 2000 capital expenditures totaled 47 million in 2001 and 220 million
in 2000

labor arbitration

	several hundred claims have been filed on behalf of nsr employees
furloughed after june 1 1999 for various periods of time alleging that
the furloughs were a result of the conrail transaction and seeking
new york dock income protection benefits one labor organization has
initiated arbitration on behalf of approximately 100 of these claimants
management believes based on known facts and circumstances including
the availability of legal defenses that the amount of liability for
these claims should not have a material adverse effect on ns financial
position results of operations or liquidity depending on the outcome of
the arbitration other claims may be filed or progressed to arbitration
should all such claimants prevail there could be a significant effect

market risks and hedging activities

	ns uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk of
volatility in its diesel fuel costs and to manage its overall exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates
	in 2001 ns began a program to hedge a portion of its diesel fuel
consumption the intent of the program is to assist in the management of
ns aggregate risk exposure to fuel price fluctuations which can
significantly affect ns operating margins and profitability through the
use of one or more types of derivative instruments
	diesel fuel costs represented 8 of ns operating expenses for 2001
the program provides that ns will not enter into any fuel hedges with a
duration of more than 36 months and that no more than 80 of ns average
monthly fuel consumption will be hedged for each month within any
36month period
	as of dec 31 2001 through swap transactions and advance
purchases ns has hedged approximately 40 of expected 2002 diesel fuel
requirements the effect of the hedges is to yield an average cost of
70 cents per hedged gallon including federal taxes and transportation
	a 10 decrease in diesel fuel prices would increase ns liability
related to the swaps by approximately 15 million
	ns manages its overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
by issuing both fixed and floatingrate debt instruments and by entering
into interestrate hedging transactions to achieve an appropriate mix
within its debt portfolio
	of ns total debt outstanding see note 8 on page 65 all is
fixedrate debt except for most capital leases 250 million of notes
due in 2003 and 174 million of equipment obligations as a result ns
debt subject to interest rate exposure totaled 675 million at dec 31
2001  a 1 increase in interest rates would increase ns total annual
interest expense related to all its variable debt by approximately
7 million management considers it unlikely that interest rate
fluctuations applicable to these instruments will result in a material
adverse effect on ns financial position results of operations
or liquidity
	the capital leases which carry an average fixed rate of 71
were effectively converted to variable rate obligations using interest
rate swap agreements on dec 31 2001 the average pay rate under these
agreements was 28 and the average receive rate was 71 during 2001
the effect of the swaps was to reduce interest expense by 3 million
a portion of the lease obligations is payable in japanese yen ns
eliminated the associated exchange rate risk at the inception of each
lease with a yen deposit sufficient to fund the yendenominated
obligation most of these deposits are held by foreign banks primarily
japanese as a result ns is exposed to financial market risk relative
to japan

environmental matters

	ns is subject to various jurisdictions environmental laws and
regulations it is ns policy to record a liability where such liability
or loss is probable and its amount can be estimated reasonably claims
if any against third parties for recovery of cleanup costs incurred by ns
are reflected as receivables when collection is probable in the balance
sheet and are not netted against the associated ns liability environmental
engineers regularly participate in ongoing evaluations of all identified
sites and in determining any necessary adjustments to initial liability
estimates ns also has established an environmental policy council composed
of senior managers to oversee and interpret its environmental policy
	operating expenses for environmental matters totaled approximately
10 million in 2001 11 million in 2000 and 12 million in 1999 and
capital expenditures totaled approximately 10 million in each of 2001 and
2000 and 8 million in 1999 capital expenditures in 2002 are expected to be
comparable to those in 2001
	ns balance sheets included liabilities for environmental exposures in
the amount of 33 million at dec 31 2001 and 36 million at dec 31 2000
of which 8 million was accounted for as a current liability in each year
at dec 31 2001 the liability represented ns estimate of the probable
cleanup and remediation costs based on available information at 126
identified locations on that date 10 sites accounted for 17 million of
the liability and no individual site was considered to be material ns
anticipates that much of this liability will be paid out over five years
however some costs will be paid out over a longer period
	at some of the 126 locations certain ns subsidiaries usually in
conjunction with a number of other parties have been identified as
potentially responsible parties by the environmental protection agency
epa or similar state authorities under the comprehensive environmental
response compensation and liability act of 1980 or comparable state
statutes which often impose joint and several liability for cleanup costs
	with respect to known environmental sites whether identified by ns
or by the epa or comparable state authorities estimates of ns ultimate
potential financial exposure for a given site or in the aggregate for all
such sites are unavoidably imprecise because of the widely varying costs
of currently available cleanup techniques the likely development of new
cleanup technologies the difficulty of determining in advance the nature
and full extent of contamination and each potential participants share of
any estimated loss and that participants ability to bear it and
evolving statutory and regulatory standards governing liability
	the risk of incurring environmental liability  for acts and
omissions past present and future  is inherent in the railroad
business some of the commodities in ns traffic mix particularly
those classified as hazardous materials can pose special risks that ns
and its subsidiaries work diligently to minimize in addition several ns
subsidiaries own or have owned land used as operating property or which
is leased or may have been leased and operated by others or held for sale
	because environmental problems that are latent or undisclosed may exist
on these properties there can be no assurance that ns will not incur
environmental liabilities or costs with respect to one or more of them
the amount and materiality of which cannot be

estimated reliably at this time moreover lawsuits and claims involving
these and other unidentified environmental sites and matters are likely to
arise from time to time the resulting liabilities could have a significant
effect on financial condition results of operations or liquidity in a
particular year or quarter
	however based on an assessment of known facts and circumstances
management believes that it is unlikely that any known matters either
individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on
ns financial position results of operations or liquidity

new accounting pronouncement

	in october 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued
statement no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived
assets statement no 144 supersedes statement no 121 accounting for the
impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed
of but it retains many of the fundamental provisions of that statement
statement no 144 also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations
to include more disposal transactions ns adoption of statement no 144
effective jan 1 2002 did not have a material effect on its
financial statements

inflation

	generally accepted accounting principles require the use of historical
cost in preparing financial statements this approach disregards the effects
of inflation on the replacement cost of property ns a capitalintensive
company has most of its capital invested in such assets the replacement
cost of these assets as well as the related depreciation expense would be
substantially greater than the amounts reported on the basis of
historical cost

trends

	federal economic regulation  efforts may be made in 2002 to reimpose
unwarranted federal economic regulation on the rail industry the staggers
rail act of 1980 which substantially reduced such regulation encouraged and
enabled rail carriers to innovate and to compete for business ns and other
rail carriers will oppose any efforts to reimpose unwarranted
economic regulation

	utility deregulation  deregulation of the electrical utility industry
is expected to increase competition among electric power generators
deregulation over time would permit wholesalers and possibly retailers of
electric power to sell or purchase increasing quantities of power to or from
distant parties the effects of deregulation on ns and on its customers cannot
be predicted with certainty however ns serves a number of efficient power
producers and is working diligently to ensure that its customers remain
competitive in this evolving environment

	carbonbased fuel  there is growing concern in some quarters that
emissions resulting from burning carbonbased fuel including coal are
contributing to global warming and causing other environmental changes to
the extent that these concerns evolve into a consensus among policymakers
the impact could be either a reduction in the demand

for coal or imposition of more stringent regulations on emissions which
might result in making coal a less economical source of power generation
or make permitting of coalfired facilities even more difficult the
revenues and net income of nsr and other railroads that move large
quantities of coal could be affected adversely

forwardlooking statements

be identified by the use of words like believe expect anticipate

evaluation of information currently available however such statements

external variables over which management has little or no control
including domestic and international economic conditions the business
environment in industries that produce and consume rail freight
competition and consolidation within the transportation industry
fluctuation in prices of key materials in particular diesel fuel
labor difficulties including strikes and work stoppages legislative
and regulatory developments changes in securities and capital markets
and natural events such as severe weather floods and earthquakes forward
