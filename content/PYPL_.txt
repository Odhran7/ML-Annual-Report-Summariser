protecting merchants and consumers 

protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is imperative to successfully competing and sustainably growing our business fraudulent activities such as account takeover identity theft including stolen financial information and counterparty malicious activities represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers as well as their payment partners we provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform we believe that these programs which help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty nonperformance are generally consistent with or broader than protections provided by other participants in the payments industry these programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers who will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item in the condition significantly as described and merchants who will receive payment for the product they deliver to the customer 

our ability to protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary endtoend payments platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our twosided network specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having paypal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands 

competition 

the global payments industry is highly competitive continuously changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies shifting user preferences and needs price sensitivity of merchants and consumers and frequent introductions of new products and services competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business

we differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences for our merchants demonstrate that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers support transactions on our payments platform across varied technologies and payment methods through the simplicity and transparency of our fee structure and our seller protection programs in addition we differentiate ourselves to consumers through the ability to use our products and services across multiple commerce channels including ecommerce mobile and payments at the point of sale and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying our customer service dispute resolution and buyer protection programs and our ability to simplify and personalize shopping experiences we invest resources towards improving our products and services offering choice in payment options providing excellent customer service and building brands that merchants and consumers trust 

our business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments we face competition from banks and financial institutions which provide traditional payment methods particularly credit cards and debit cards collectively “payment cards” electronic bank transfers and credit payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks payment card processors and “card on file” services we also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services including tokenized and contactless payment cards digital wallets and mobile payments solutions credit installment or other buy now pay later methods realtime payment systems p2p payments and money remittance services card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants our products and services face competition from all forms of payments which include paperbased payments primarily cash and checks credit cards debit cards electronic bank transfers credit installment methods digital wallets and mobile payment solutions contactless payments including contactless cards tokenized cards near field communication based solutions and qr codebased solutions and virtual currencies such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins

the techniques used to attempt to obtain unauthorized or illegal access to systems and information including customers’ personal data disable or degrade service exploit vulnerabilities or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and in some circumstances may not be recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target unauthorized parties have attempted and we expect that they will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including but not limited to hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers partners or vendors and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems including employees and customers into disclosing user names passwords payment card information or other sensitive information used to gain access to such systems or facilities this information may in turn be used to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our information technology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks cyberextortion distributed denialofservice attacks ransomware spear phishing and social engineering schemes the introduction of computer viruses or other malware and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance insider threats system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities we believe that paypal is a particularly attractive target for cybercriminals due to our name brand recognition types of data including paymentsrelated data that customers provide to us and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services 

any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers partners or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects for example in november 2017 we suspended the operations of tio networks “tio” acquired in july 2017 as part of an investigation of security vulnerabilities of the tio platform in december 2017 we announced that we had identified evidence of unauthorized access to tio’s network and the potential compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 16 million tio customers this incident resulted in governmental inquiries and civil claims against us and may lead to additional inquiries and claims in the future 

under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses cybersecurity breaches and other exploited security vulnerabilities could subject us to significant costs and liabilities result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws require us to change our business practices cause us to incur significant remediation costs lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services damage our reputation and brands divert the attention of management from the operation of our business result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them or expose us to regulatory penalties and fines while we maintain insurance policies intended to offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security breaches and other damage to or unavailability of our systems 



business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites applications products or services or otherwise harm our business 

our systems and operations and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future business interruptions or degradation because of distributed denialofservice and other cyberattacks insider threats hardware and software defects or malfunctions human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires and other natural disasters public health crises including pandemics power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events the frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change are increasing which could increase the likelihood and severity of such disasters as well as related damage and business interruption our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area a seismically active region in california a catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures to resume or maintain operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally some of our systems including those of companies we have acquired are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events as a provider of payments solutions we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plans and rigorous testing of such plans which may be costly and timeconsuming to implement and may divert our resources from other business priorities 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures cyberattacks unplanned outages and other events or conditions from time to time that have and may interrupt the availability or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and services these events have resulted and likely will continue to result in loss of revenue a prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability speed or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could permanently harm our relationship with our customers and partners and our reputation moreover if any system failure or similar event results in damage to our customers or their business partners they could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims even if unsuccessful would likely be timeconsuming and costly for us to address and could have other consequences described in this “risk factors” section under the caption “ cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition ” 

we have undertaken and continue to undertake certain system upgrades and replatforming efforts designed to improve the availability reliability resiliency and speed of our platform these efforts are costly and timeconsuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will be effective frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fines and penalties and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business 

we also rely on facilities components applications and services supplied by third parties including data center facilities and cloud data storage and processing services from time to time we have experienced interruptions in the provision of such facilities and services provided by these third parties if these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions including a cybersecurity incident breach their agreements with us or fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which could result in customer dissatisfaction regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation and brands and materially and adversely affect our business while we maintain insurance policies intended to offset the financial impact we may experience from these risks our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events 

in addition any failure to successfully implement new information systems and technologies or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business internal controls including internal controls over financial reporting results of operations and financial condition 



if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services the use of our products and services and consequently our revenues could decline 

rapid significant and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate for example payment technologies including realtime payments payment card tokenization virtual currencies distributed ledger and blockchain technologies and proximity payment technology such as near field communication and other contactless payments internet browser technologies that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or ecommerce website artificial intelligence and machine learning developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations and instore digital and social commerce 

we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies these third parties may restrict or prevent our access to or utilization of those technologies as well as their platforms or products we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require significant investment take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be limited or restricted by industrywide standards platform providers payments networks changes to laws and regulations changing expectations of consumers or merchants thirdparty intellectual property rights and other factors our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable to do so in a timely or costeffective manner our business could be harmed 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight our failure to comply with extensive complex overlapping and frequently changing rules regulations and legal interpretations could materially harm our business 

our business is subject to complex and changing laws rules regulations policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we offer services directly or through partners including but not limited to those governing banking credit deposit taking crossborder and domestic money transmission prepaid access foreign currency exchange privacy data protection data governance cybersecurity banking secrecy digital payments cryptocurrency payment services including payment processing and settlement services fraud detection consumer protection antitrust and competition economic and trade sanctions antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing 

regulators globally have been establishing and increasing their regulatory authority oversight and enforcement in a manner that impacts our business as we introduce new products and services and expand into new markets including through acquisitions we expect to become subject to additional regulations restrictions and licensing requirements as we expand and localize our international activities we expect that our obligations in the markets in which we operate will continue to increase in addition because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws which may impose different more specific or conflicting obligations on us as well as broader liability 

any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of any government authority including changes to or expansion of their interpretation may subject us to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions result in additional compliance and licensure requirements cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business increase regulatory scrutiny of our business divert management’s time and attention from our business restrict our operations lead to increased friction for customers force us to make changes to our business practices products or operations require us to engage in remediation activities or delay planned transactions product launches or improvements any of the foregoing could individually or in the aggregate harm our reputation damage our brands and business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the complexity of united states “us” federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not violate such laws and regulations 



payments regulation 

in the us paypal inc a whollyowned subsidiary holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in the states where such licenses are required as well as in the district of columbia and certain territories if we violate the laws or regulations covered under our licenses we could be subject to liability andor additional restrictions forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states or territories forced to change our business practices or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals which could impose substantial costs and harm our business 

while we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets including the us to also receive payments in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds these limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business 

we principally provide our services to customers in the european economic area “eea” and the united kingdom “uk” through paypal europe our whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in luxembourg paypal europe is potentially subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates applicable requirements additionally compliance with applicable laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to potentially inconsistent interpretations and domestic regulations by various countries in the region european regulation such as the revised payment services directive “psd2” enabling payment and account information sharing by regulated payment providers could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks if the business activities of paypal europe exceed certain thresholds or if the european central bank “ecb” determines paypal europe may be deemed a significant supervised entity and certain activity of paypal europe would become directly supervised by the ecb rather than by the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs 

in many of the other markets outside the us in which we do business we serve our customers through paypal pte ltd our whollyowned subsidiary based in singapore paypal pte ltd is supervised by the monetary authority of singapore “mas” but does not hold a remittance license as a result paypal pte ltd is not able to offer outbound remittance payments to paypal customers from singapore in many of the markets other than singapore served by paypal pte ltd it is unclear and uncertain whether our singaporebased service is subject only to singapore law or if it is subject to the application of local laws whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service bank financial institution or otherwise the payment services act came into effect in singapore in january 2020 paypal pte ltd has submitted an application for a major payment institution license to the mas to continue to provide payments services and is operating under an exemption from holding a license within a statutory transition period while the application is pending once paypal pte ltd obtains its license we will be required to comply with new regulatory requirements which will result in increased operational complexity and costs for our singapore and international operations 

in addition in certain markets outside of the us we provide our services to customers through paypal pte ltd or if required by local regulations a local branch of paypal pte ltd or a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight from time to time we may also acquire entities subject to local payments regulatory supervision or oversight 

there are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses certifications and approvals and we could be subject to fines other enforcement actions and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to or decide to continue to apply for or obtain any licenses renewals certifications and approvals in any jurisdictions in certain markets we may rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency and local regulators may use their authority over such local partners to prohibit restrict or limit us from doing business the need to obtain or maintain licenses certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial additional costs delay or preclude planned transactions product launches or improvements require significant and costly operational changes impose restrictions limitations or additional requirements on our business products and services or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market 

cryptocurrency regulation 

our current and planned cryptocurrency offerings could subject us to additional regulations licensing requirements or other obligations the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape with respect to cryptocurrency may subject us to inquiries or investigations from regulators and governmental authorities require us to make product changes restrict or discontinue product offerings and implement additional and potentially costly controls if we fail to comply with regulations requirements 



prohibitions or other obligations applicable to us we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences 

in addition financial and third party risks related to our cryptocurrency offerings such as inappropriate access to or theft or destruction of cryptocurrency assets held by our custodian insufficient insurance coverage by the custodian to reimburse us for all such losses the custodian’s failure to maintain effective controls over the custody and settlement services provided to us the custodian’s inability to purchase or liquidate cryptocurrency holdings and defaults on financial or performance obligations by counterparty financial institutions could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business 

lending regulation 

we hold a number of us state lending licenses for our us consumer shortterm installment loan product which is subject to federal and state laws governing consumer credit and debt collection while our nonus consumer shortterm installment loan products which are available in the uk france germany spain italy and australia are generally exempt from primary consumer credit legislation certain consumer lending laws consumer protection or banking transparency regulations continue to apply to these products increased global regulatory focus on shortterm installment products and consumer credit more broadly could result in laws or regulations requiring changes to our policies procedures operations and product offerings and restrict or limit our ability to offer credit products we could be subject to fines other enforcement action and litigation if we are found to violate any aspects of applicable law or regulations 

consumer protection 

violations of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations including the electronic fund transfer act “efta” and regulation e as implemented by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” could result in the assessment of significant actual damages or statutory damages or penalties including treble damages in some instances and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees we are subject to and have paid amounts in settlement of lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the efta and regulation e or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices eg that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts 

in october 2021 the cfpb issued an order pursuant to its marketmonitoring authority requiring us to provide extensive information on our payment products including with respect to the collection use of and access to data and consumer protections among other items in december 2021 the cfpb issued a separate order pursuant to its marketmonitoring authority requiring us to provide information on our buy now pay later offerings 

paypal principally offers its services in the eea countries through a “passport” notification process through paypal europes luxembourg regulator to regulators in other eea member states in accordance with eu regulations as well as in the uk through the temporary permissions regime regulators in these countries could notify us of and seek to enforce local consumer protection laws that apply to our business in addition to luxembourg consumer protection laws and could also seek to persuade the local regulator to order paypal to conduct its activities in the local country directly or through a branch office these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of or delay our ability to expand our business in europe 

antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing economic and trade sanctions 

regulators in the us and around the world continue to increase standards and expectations regarding antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing and to expand the scope of existing laws and regulations to emerging products and markets which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program globally andor in specific jurisdictions including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage lead to increased friction for customers and result in a decrease in business regulators regularly reexamine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater compliance costs and impact our business in addition we are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the us the eu relevant eu member states and other jurisdictions in which we operate noncompliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations or economic and trade sanctions may subject us to significant fines penalties lawsuits and enforcement actions result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operations and damage our reputation and brands see “note 13—commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance program 



privacy and protection of customer data 

the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict including with respect to technologies such as cloud computing artificial intelligence cryptocurrency and blockchain technology any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to customers or with privacy and data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities government entities or others such proceedings or actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase the costs and complexity of compliance result in reputational harm and materially harm our business in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may restrict or limit our ability to provide products and services to our customers 

paypal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of eea individuals to the us including binding corporate rules for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and standard contractual clauses “sccs” as approved by the european commission for transfers to and from third parties in june 2021 the european commission imposed new scc requirements which impose certain contract and operational requirements on paypal its merchants and vendors in order to adhere to certain affirmative duties including requirements related to government access transparency enhanced data subject rights and broader third party assessments to ensure safeguards necessary to protect personal data exported from paypal’s eea customers andor employees to countries outside the eea to the extent paypal relies on sccs such engagements will require new contractual arrangements under the updated requirements to avoid limitations on paypal’s ability to process eea data in countries outside of the eea 

in the wake of the california consumer privacy act passed in 2018 multiple us states have adopted or proposed similar legislation to protect consumers in their states california passed the consumer privacy rights act of 2020 and virginia and colorado have passed similar privacy and data protection laws the continued increase in statelevel privacy laws is likely to result in a disparate array of privacy rules with unaligned or conflicting provisions accountability requirements individual rights and state enforcement powers and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny and business costs and lead to unintended consumer confusion 

we are subject to regulatory scrutiny and may be subject to legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws 

we are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the us and internationally including in connection with proposed or implemented business combinations acquisitions investments partnerships commercial agreements and business practices some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us individual states other countries or the eu or otherwise constitute unfair competition some regulators and legislators particularly those outside of the us may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive any claims or investigations even if without merit may be very expensive to defend or respond to involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in reputational harm significant judgments fines and remedial actions against us or require us to change our business practices make product or operational changes or delay or preclude planned transactions product launches or improvements 

we are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory scrutiny and government inquiries 

we are regularly subject to claims individual and class action lawsuits arbitration proceedings government and regulatory investigations inquiries actions or requests and other proceedings alleging violations of laws rules and regulations with respect to competition antitrust intellectual property privacy data protection information security antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing sanctions antibribery anticorruption consumer protection fraud accessibility securities tax labor and employment commercial disputes services charitable fundraising contract disputes escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property product liability use of our services for illegal purposes the matters described in “note 13—commitments and contingencies—litigation and regulatory matters—general matters” to our consolidated financial statements and other matters the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries has increased and is expected to continue to increase as our products services and business expand in complexity scale scope and geographic reach including through acquisitions of businesses and technology investigations and legal proceedings are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations and could result in substantial payments to satisfy judgments fines penalties or settlements negative publicity substantial diversion of management time and effort reputational harm criminal sanctions or orders that prevent or limit us from offering certain products or services require us to change our business practices in costly ways develop noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or delay or preclude planned transactions product launches or improvements determining legal reserves or possible losses from such 



matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights 

we are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights at any given time we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and subject to intellectual property infringement claims intellectual property infringement claims against us may result from among other things our expansion into new business areas including through acquisitions of businesses and technology and new or expanded products and services and their convergence with technologies not previously associated with areas related to our business products and services the ultimate outcome of any allegation or claim is often uncertain and any such claim with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business result in reputational harm and require us to among other things redesign or stop providing our products or services pay substantial amounts to settle claims or lawsuits satisfy judgments or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees 

we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks copyrights domain names trade dress patents and trade secrets is important to the success of our business effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which we offer our products and services although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction or that our contractual arrangements will prevent or deter third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or that third parties may independently develop equivalent or superior intellectual property rights we may be required to expend significant time and resources to prevent third party infringement and enforce our rights and we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights if we are unable to prevent third parties from using or offering technologies that infringe our patent or trade secret rights the uniqueness and value of our products and services could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business 

business and operations risks 

the continuing effects of the novel coronavirus “covid19” pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the ultimate extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain difficult to predict and subject to change including but not limited to the duration scope severity proliferation of variants and increase in the transmissibility of the virus its impact on the global economy actions taken to contain or limit the impact of covid19 such as the availability of an effective vaccine or treatment geographic variation in how countries and states are handling the pandemic and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions may potentially resume 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact the operations of our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and may adversely impact our results of operations in the future crossborder and domestic commerce may be adversely impacted by measures taken by government authorities and businesses globally to contain and limit the spread of covid19 including travel restrictions border closures quarantines shelter in place and lock down orders mask and social distancing requirements and business limitations and shutdowns to the extent that such mitigation measures remain in place or are reinstated for significant periods of time they may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations actions that we have taken or may take in the future intended to assist customers impacted by covid19 may negatively impact our results of operations in particular we have experienced and may continue to experience adverse financial impacts from a number of operational factors including but not limited to increased liability under our buyer protection program or chargebacks on payment cards resulting from merchants’ selling goods or services in advance of the delivery date or experiencing bankruptcy insolvency or other business interruption customer defaults on 



payment obligations under paypal branded credit products increased cybersecurity and payment fraud risk challenges to the availability and reliability of our products and services and supply chain disruptions impacting our business 

while our business has benefited from the shift from instore shopping and traditional payment methods towards ecommerce and digital payments to the extent that customer preferences revert to precovid19 behaviors as the pandemicrelated restrictions lessen our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 

the significant increase in the number of our employees who are working remotely as a result of the pandemic and an extended period of remote work arrangements and subsequent reintroduction into the workplace could introduce operational risk increase cybersecurity risk strain our business continuity plans negatively impact productivity and give rise to claims by employees or otherwise adversely affect our business additionally covid19 could require new or modified processes procedures and controls to respond to changes in our business environment we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities 

the impacts of covid19 individually or collectively could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section 

we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive continuously changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies shifting user preferences and needs price sensitivity of merchants and consumers and frequent introductions of new products and services competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business 

we compete with a wide range of businesses in every aspect of our business some of our current and potential competitors are larger than we are have larger customer bases greater brand recognition longer operating histories a dominant or more secure position broader geographic scope volume scale resources and market share than we do or offer products and services that we do not offer other competitors are smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes our competitors may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of products and services andor offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs products and services we often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships to be important to our business competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish grow or maintain these partner relationships if we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors drive value for our customers or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively see “item 1 business—competition” of this form 10k for further discussion of the competitive environment in the markets where we operate 

changes to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our business 

to process certain transactions we must comply with applicable payment card bank or other network collectively “network” rules the rules govern all aspects of a transaction on the networks including fees and other practices from time to time the networks have increased the fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks certain networks have also imposed special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as the one that paypal offers our payment processors may have the right to pass any increases in fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing any increase in interchange fees special fees or assessments for transactions that we pay to the networks or our payment processors could make our pricing less competitive increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income which could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

in some jurisdictions government regulations have required the payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees any changes in interchange fee rates or limitations or their applicability to paypal could adversely affect our competitive position against payment card service providers and the revenue we earn from our branded card programs require us to change our business practices and harm our business 



we may also be subject to fines assessed by the networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants the networks set and interpret their rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules such allegations may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business the network rules may also increase the cost of impose restrictions on or otherwise impact the development of our products which may negatively affect their deployment and adoption the networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement which could require us to make significant changes to our products if we become unable or limited in our ability to accept certain payment types such as debit or credit cards our business would be adversely affected 

changes in how consumers fund their paypal transactions could harm our business 

we pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts from an existing paypal account balance or venmo account balance or through our paypal branded consumer credit products our financial performance is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards which can significantly increase our costs although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing paypal account balance or venmo account balance to fund payment transactions some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards which may offer features and benefits not provided as part of their paypal accounts an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lowercost funding options could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business 

our ability to receive the benefit of us merchant financing offerings may be subject to challenge 

merchant loans under our us paypal working capital “ppwc” and paypal business loan “ppbl” products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans after origination in june 2020 largely in response to the madden v midland funding llc case decided in the us court of appeals for the second circuit the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” approved a final rule clarifying that loans originated by statechartered nonmember banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan reflecting a similar rule finalized by the office of the comptroller of currency “occ” in may 2020 the final rule reaffirms and codifies in regulation the socalled “validwhenmade doctrine” which provides that the interest rate for a loan is determined when the loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale assignment or other transfer a number of state attorneys general have challenged these fdic and occ rules and there remains some uncertainty whether nonbank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by fdicinsured state chartered industrial banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws an adverse outcome of these or similar challenges or changes to applicable laws and regulations or regulatory policy could materially impact our us ppwc and ppbl products and our business 

our credit products expose us to additional risks 

we offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the us and various international markets the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk the credit decisionmaking process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on among other factors their past purchase and transaction history with paypal or venmo and their credit scores similarly proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our merchant financing offerings to help predict their ability to repay these risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions including those related to the particular consumer or merchant market conditions economic environment or limited transaction history or other data the accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements changes in consumer behavior changes in the economic environment issuing bank policies and other factors 

we generally rely on thirdparty chartered financial institutions to provide paypal and venmo branded consumer credit and merchant financing offerings to our us customers as a service provider to these thirdparty chartered financial institutions which are federally supervised us financial institutions we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators in the event of any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant financing products could be interrupted or limited which could materially and adversely affect our business we may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution on favorable terms or at all obtaining licenses to originate such loans would be a costly timeconsuming and uncertain process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements which could significantly increase our costs and compliance 



obligations and require us to change our business practices 

we are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations creating the risk of potential chargeoffs or negative impact to revenue share arrangement with synchrony bank with respect to our us consumer credit product the nonpayment rate among account holders may increase due to among other factors changes to underwriting standards risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user worsening economic conditions such as a recession or government austerity programs increases in prevailing interest rates and high unemployment rates account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans 

we currently purchase receivables related to our paypal branded merchant financing offerings in the us and extend credit for our consumer and merchants products outside the us through our international subsidiaries if we are unable to fund our credit products or the purchase of the receivables related to our merchant financing offerings in the us adequately or in a costeffective manner or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes the growth of our credit products could be negatively impacted 

for information on lending regulations that impact our business see “ our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight our failure to comply with extensive complex overlapping and frequently changing rules regulations and legal interpretations could materially harm our business — lending regulation ” in this risk factor section 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business including but not limited to networks banks payment processors and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions unaffiliated thirdparty lenders to originate our us credit products to consumers us merchant financing and branded credit card products paypalbranded debit card products issued by an unaffiliated bank cryptocurrency custodial service providers and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions eg outsourced customer support and product development functions facilities information technology data center facilities and cloud computing these risks include legal regulatory information security reputational operational or any other risks inherent in engaging and relying upon a thirdparty if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships our operations results of operations and financial results could be adversely impacted additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 

any factors that reduce crossborder trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business 

crossborder trade ie transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries is an important source of our revenues and profits crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market in certain markets crossborder trade represents our primary and in some instances our only presence 

crossborder trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including but not limited to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of crossborder trade and foreign exchange any factors that increase the costs of crossborder trade for us or our customers or that restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical such as trade policy higher tariffs or localization requirements could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume negatively impact our revenues and profits and harm our business 

failure to deal effectively with fraud abusive behaviors bad transactions and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services 

third parties have attempted and we expect that they will likely continue to attempt to abuse access to and misuse our payment services to commit fraud by among other things creating fictitious paypal accounts using stolen or synthetic identities or personal information making transactions with stolen financial instruments abusing or misusing our services for financial gain or fraudulently inducing users of our systems into engaging in bad transactions due to the nature of paypal’s digital payments services third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing 



fraud particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings if these measures do not succeed our business could be negatively impacted we also incur substantial losses from erroneous transactions and situations where funding instruments used for legitimate transactions are closed or have insufficient funds to satisfy payments or the payment is made to an unintended recipient in error numerous and evolving fraud schemes and misuse of our payments service could subject us to significant costs and liabilities require us to change our business practices cause us to incur significant remediation costs lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services damage our reputation and brands divert the attention of management from the operation of our business and result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them 

our buyer and seller protection programs are intended to reduce the likelihood of losses for consumers and merchants from fraudulent transactions the buyer protection program also protects consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description we incur substantial losses from our buyer and seller protection programs as a result of disputes filed by our customers we seek to recover losses from our buyer and seller protection programs from the merchant but may not be able to fully recover them if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant or the merchant provides sufficient evidence that the item was delivered 

in addition consumers who pay through paypal or venmo may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer which in turn will seek recovery from us if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment which would negatively impact our business regulators and card networks may also adapt error resolution and chargeback requirements to account for evolving forms of fraud which could increase paypal’s exposure to fraud losses and impact the scope of coverage of our buyer and seller protection programs increases in our loss rate including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our buyer and seller protection programs could negatively impact our business see “note 13—commitments and contingencies—protection programs” to our consolidated financial statements 

failure to effectively monitor and evaluate the financial condition of our merchants may also expose paypal to losses in the event of the bankruptcy insolvency business failure or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use eg airline cruise or concert tickets custommade goods and subscriptions we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services including through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payments allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses 

use of our payments services for illegal activities or improper purposes could harm our business 

users have attempted and may attempt in the future to use our payments platform for illegal activities or improper uses such as money laundering terrorist financing sanctions evasion illegal online gambling fraudulent sales of goods or services illegal telemarketing activities illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances piracy of software movies music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods in particular digital goods bank fraud child pornography human trafficking prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products securities fraud pyramid or ponzi schemes or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity moreover certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods resulting in liability for us owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions including paypal that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items while we invest in measures intended to prevent and detect illegal activities that may occur within our payments platform these measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing illegal activity or improper uses 

any illegal or improper uses of our payments platform by our users may subject us to claims individual and class action lawsuits and government and regulatory requests inquiries or investigations that could result in liability restrict our operations require us to change our business practices harm our reputation increase our costs and negatively impact our business for example government enforcement or regulatory authorities could seek to impose additional restrictions or liability on us arising from the use of our payments platform for illegal or improper activity and our failure to detect or prevent such use 

acquisitions strategic investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business 



we expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including but not limited to business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses technologies services products and other assets strategic investments and commercial and strategic partnerships collectively “strategic transactions” at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions any of which could individually or in the aggregate be material to our financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying negotiating consummating and integrating favorable transaction opportunities strategic transactions may involve additional significant challenges uncertainties and risks including but not limited to challenges of integrating new employees products systems technologies operations and business cultures challenges associated with operating acquired businesses in markets in which we may have limited or no experience failure to develop the acquired business adequately disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’s attention inadequate data security cybersecurity and operational and information technology resilience failure to identify or our underestimation of commitments liabilities deficiencies and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets potential exposure to new risks associated with acquired businesses and entities including potential new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal regulatory and compliance requirements potential reputational risks that could arise from transactions with or investments in companies particularly those involved in new or developing businesses or industries which may be subject to uncertain or evolving legal regulatory and compliance requirements failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and of its anticipated benefits to materialize potential impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets and the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt strategic transactions may also heighten many of the risks described in this “risk factors” section these transactions are inherently risky may not be successful and may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations we may be dependent on controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and damage our reputation and brand 

our international operations subject us to increased risks which could harm our business 

our international operations generate approximately onehalf of our net revenues our international operations including any expansion in international markets subject us to significant challenges uncertainties and risks including but not limited to local regulatory licensing reporting and legal obligations costs and challenges associated with operating in markets in which we may have limited or no experience including effectively localizing our products and services and adapting them to local preferences difficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences and in light of varying laws regulations and customs differing employment practices and the existence of works councils difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees and maintaining our company culture fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates exchange control regulations profit repatriation restrictions potential tariffs sanctions fines or other trade barriers or restrictions import or export regulations compliance with us and foreign antibribery anticorruption sanctions antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions and national or regional political economic or social instability 

our international operations also may heighten many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section any violations of the complex foreign and us laws rules and regulations that may apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us and our directors officers and employees prohibit or require us to change our business practices and damage our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks are inherent in our international operations may increase our costs of doing business internationally and could materially and adversely affect our business 

brexit the uk’s departure from the eu could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

following the departure of the uk from the eu and the eea on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” and the expiration of the transition period on december 31 2020 there continues to be uncertainty over the practical consequences of brexit including the potential for brexit to contribute to longterm instability in financial stock and currency exchange markets greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the uk and eea region and a general deterioration in consumer sentiment and credit conditions leading to overall negative economic growth and increased risk of 



merchant default 

the consequences of brexit have brought legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms which could continue as national laws and regulations in the uk differ from eu laws and regulations and additional authorization requirements come into effect these developments have led and could lead in the future to additional regulatory costs and challenges for us including but not limited to the following 

• paypal europe operates in the uk within the scope of its passport permissions as they existed at the end of the transition period pursuant to the temporary permissions regime pending the grant of new uk authorizations by the uk financial regulators if we are unable to obtain the required authorizations before the expiry of the longstop dates set by the uk regulators under the temporary permissions regime our european operations could lose their ability to offer services into the uk market on a crossborder basis and 

• our european operations being required to comply with new legal and regulatory requirements in the uk that may be in addition to or inconsistent with those of the eea in each case leading to increased complexity and costs 

global and regional economic conditions could harm our business 

adverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets including but not limited to tightening in the credit markets extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets including the fixed income credit currency equity and commodity markets higher unemployment high consumer debt levels recessionary or inflationary pressures supply chain issues reduced consumer confidence or economic activity government fiscal and tax policies us and international trade relationships agreements treaties tariffs and restrictive actions the inability of a government to enact a budget in a fiscal year government shutdowns government austerity programs and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform additionally any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets and increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results see “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – impact of foreign currency exchange rates and liquidity and capital resources” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for additional information on our financial risks 

real or perceived inaccuracies in our metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems including systems that are organically developed or acquired through business combinations while the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at scale the methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment 

we regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance for example we continuously apply models processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms and work to improve and enhance those capabilities when we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material further as our business develops we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our performance if investors analysts or customers do not consider our reported measures to be sufficient or to accurately reflect our business we may receive negative publicity our reputation may be harmed and our business may be adversely impacted 

environmental social and governance “esg” issues may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

customers investors employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on esg practices including our efforts with respect to global talent cybersecurity data privacy and protection and climate change if we do not adapt to and comply with new laws and regulations or changes to legal or regulatory requirements concerning esg matters or fail to meet rapidly evolving investor industry or stakeholder expectations and standards or if the company is perceived to have not responded appropriately to growing concerns with respect to esg issues our reputation may be harmed customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 



we specifically recognize the inherent physical climaterelated risks wherever business is conducted our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change for example california where our headquarters is located has historically experienced and is projected to continue to experience climaterelated events more frequently including drought water scarcity heat waves wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention these extreme weather conditions may disrupt our business and may cause us to experience additional costs to maintain or resume operations and higher attrition in addition current and emerging legal and regulatory requirements with respect to climate change eg carbon pricing and other aspects of esg eg disclosure requirements may result in increased compliance requirements on our business and supply chain which may increase our operating costs and cause disruptions in our operations 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents receivables outstanding and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the us and international jurisdictions as part of our currency hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities we regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk despite these efforts we may be exposed to the risk of default by or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of these counterparty financial institutions if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited held in accounts with or otherwise due from such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

there are risks associated with our indebtedness 

we have incurred indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences including without limitation requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes including capital expenditures acquisitions strategic investments and share repurchases reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business competition pressures and market conditions and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions strategic investments share repurchases or other general corporate and other purposes 

our revolving credit facilities and the indentures for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict among other things our business and operations if we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period moreover any such acceleration and required repayment of or default in respect of our indebtedness could in turn constitute an event of default under other debt instruments thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected 

changes in tax laws exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities or implementation of recordkeeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

an increasing number of us states the us federal government and foreign jurisdictions as well as international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development and the eu commission are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes these actions may materially affect our effective tax rate 



the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by tax authorities in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities that differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements which may individually or in the aggregate materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient 

in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by the incurrence of losses or earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities including as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles or by certain discrete items 

a number of us states the us federal government and foreign jurisdictions have implemented and may impose reporting or recordkeeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance a number of jurisdictions are also reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes we have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and recordkeeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions and harm our business 

we may be unable to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

competition for key and other highly skilled personnel is intense especially for executive talent software engineers and other technology talent we may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration travel or availability of visas for skilled workers the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract hire develop motivate and retain key and other highly qualified and diverse talent whether in a remote or inoffice environment or address the safety health and productivity of our workforce could harm our overall business and results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services 

we may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through our online services including claims alleging defamation libel harassment hate speech breach of contract invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services among other things we invest in measures intended to detect and block activities that may occur within our payments platform in violation of our policies these measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing the exchange of information in violation of our policies if these measures are not effective our business could be negatively impacted if the laws or regulations that provide protections for online dissemination of information are invalidated or are modified to reduce protections available to us and we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings which could harm our business

business environment 

the company 

we are a leading technology platform that enables digital payments and simplifies commerce experiences on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide paypal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve anytime on any platform and using any device when sending payments or getting paid including persontoperson payments 

regulatory environment 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry including countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy cybersecurity and consumer protection the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation new or changing laws and regulations including changes to their interpretation and implementation as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition we monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers 

information security 

information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage prevent data loss and other security incidents and effectively respond to known and potential risks and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections we remain subject to these risks and there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide sufficient security or prevent breaches or attacks for additional information regarding our information security risks see “item 1a risk factors— cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition ” 



covid19 

the coronavirus “covid19” pandemic has resulted in government authorities and businesses throughout the world implementing numerous measures intended to contain and limit the spread of covid19 including travel restrictions border closures quarantines shelterinplace and lockdown orders mask and social distancing requirements and business limitations and shutdowns the spread of covid19 and increased variants has caused and may continue to cause us to make significant modifications to our business practices including enabling most of our workforce to work from home establishing strict health and safety protocols for our offices restricting physical participation in meetings events and conferences and imposing restrictions on employee travel we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business practices as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers or business partners 

the spread of covid19 has also accelerated the shift from instore shopping and traditional instore payment methods eg cash towards ecommerce and digital payments and resulted in increased customer demand for safer payment and delivery solutions eg contactless payment methods buy online and pick up in store and significant increases in online spending in certain verticals that have historically had a strong instore presence on balance our business has benefited from these behavioral shifts to the extent that consumers revert to precovid19 behaviors as the pandemicrelated restrictions lessen our business financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 

the rapidly changing global market and economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our operations and business the broader implications of the covid19 pandemic and related global economic unpredictability on our business financial condition and results of operations remain uncertain for additional information on how the covid19 pandemic has impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business see below for specific discussion in the respective areas and also refer to “part i item 1a risk factors” in this form 10k 

brexit 

the united kingdom “uk” formally exited the european union “eu” and the european economic area “eea” on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” with the expiration of the transition period on december 31 2020 paypal europe sàrl et cie sca “paypal europe” operates in the uk within the scope of its passport permissions as they stood at the end of the transition period under the temporary permissions regime pending the grant of new uk authorizations by the uk financial regulators we are currently unable to determine the longerterm impact that brexit will have on our business which will depend in part on the implications of new tariff trade and regulatory frameworks that now govern the provision of crossborder goods and services between the uk and the eea as well as the financial and operational consequences of the requirement for paypal europe to obtain new uk authorizations to operate its business longerterm within the uk market for additional information on how brexit could affect our business see “item 1a risk factors— brexit the uks departure from the eu could harm our business financial condition and results of operations ” 

brexit may contribute to instability in financial stock and foreign currency exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro we have foreign currency exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements the tables below provide the percentage of our total net revenues and gross loans and interest receivable from the uk and eu excluding the uk for the periods presented 





the change in the percentage of gross loans and interest receivable due from customers in the uk and eu yearoveryear was primarily attributable to expansion of our installment credit products in the eu 



overview of results of operations 

the following table provides a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



all amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million except as otherwise noted as a result certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided 

 not meaningful 

net revenues increased 39 billion or 18 in 2021 compared to 2020 driven primarily by growth in total payment volume “tpv” as defined below under “key metrics” of 33 

total operating expenses increased 29 billion or 16 in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and to a lesser extent increases in sales and marketing expenses technology and development expenses and customer support and operations expenses partially offset by a decline in transaction and credit losses 

operating income increased 973 million or 30 in 2021 compared to 2020 due to growth in net revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses our operating margin was 17 and 15 in 2021 and 2020 respectively operating margin for 2021 was positively impacted primarily by the decrease in transaction and credit losses 

net income decreased by 33 million or 1 in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to a decrease in other income expense net of 19 billion driven primarily by lower net gains on strategic investments in 2021 compared to the prior year partially offset by the previously discussed increase in operating income of 973 million and a decrease in income tax expense of 933 million associated with lower net gains on strategic investments higher benefits associated with stockbased compensation deductions and lower expense related to intragroup transfers of intellectual property 

impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

we have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results the strengthening or weakening of the united states “us” dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar in 2021 2020 and 2019 we generated approximately 46 49 and 47 of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the united states respectively because we generate substantial net revenues internationally we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the us including those discussed under “item 1a risk factors” 



we calculate the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings 

in the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the yearoveryear foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar had the following impact on our reported results 



while we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure 

we also used a foreign currency exchange contract designated as a net investment hedge to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary this contract matured in 2020 gains and losses associated with this instrument will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated 

additionally in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities 

key metrics and financial results 

key metrics 

active accounts number of payment transactions number of payment transactions per active account and tpv are key nonfinancial performance metrics “key metrics” that management uses to measure the performance of our business and are defined as follows 

• an active account is an account registered directly with paypal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our platform not including gatewayexclusive transactions within the past 12 months a platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to paypal’s platform or services through such third party’s login credentials including entities that utilize hyperwallet’s payout capabilities a user may register on our platform to access different products and may register more than one account to access a product accordingly a user may have more than one active account the number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the growth and overall scale of our platform 



• number of payment transactions are the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

• number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12month period divided by active accounts at the end of the period the number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the average number of times a customer account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period 

• tpv is the value of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

as our transaction revenue is typically correlated with tpv growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform the engagement level of our customers and underlying activity and trends which are indicators of current and future performance we present these key metrics to enhance investors’ evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results 

our key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems including systems that are organically developed or acquired through business combinations while the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale the methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment 

we regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance for example we continuously apply models processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms and work to improve and enhance those capabilities when we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material 

net revenues 

our revenues are classified into the following two categories 

• transaction revenues  net transaction fees primarily charged to merchants on a transaction basis based on the tpv completed on our payments platform growth in tpv is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform we earn additional fees from merchants and consumers on transactions where we perform currency conversion where we enable crossborder transactions ie transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their paypal or venmo account to their debit card or bank account to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies and other miscellaneous fees 

• revenues from other value added services net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships referral fees subscription fees gateway fees and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers we also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances 

our revenues can be significantly impacted by but not limited to the following 

  

• the mix of merchants products and services 

• the mix between domestic and crossborder transactions 

• the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs and 

• the amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers

net revenues analysis 

the components of our net revenues for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows in millions 

transaction revenues 

transaction revenues grew by 35 billion or 17 in 2021 compared to 2020 mainly attributable to our braintree and core paypal products and services and to a lesser extent venmo products and services driven by strong growth in tpv and the number of payment transactions on our payments platform in the year ended december 31 2021 we benefited from the recovery of travel and events verticals which were adversely impacted in the prior year as a result of the covid19 pandemic these factors favorably impacting growth in transaction revenues in 2021 were partially offset by a decline in tpv and revenue we generate from ebay’s marketplace platform which we expect to continue to a lesser extent to negatively impact revenue growth trends in the first half of 2022 

in the first quarter of 2020 we experienced an adverse impact on our tpv and transaction revenues due to the initial impact of the covid19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020 we benefited from a shift from instore payment methods to digital payments as described above which was sustained throughout the remainder of 2020 and in 2021 

the graphs below present the respective key metrics in millions for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

reflects active accounts at the end of the applicable period active accounts as of december 31 2021 and 2020 include 32 million active accounts contributed by paidy inc “paidy” on the date of acquisition in october 2021 and 102 million active accounts contributed by honey on the date of acquisition in january 2020 respectively 



the following table provides a summary of related metrics 



 not meaningful 

we had active accounts of 426 million and 377 million as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively an increase of 13 number of payment transactions were 193 billion and 154 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively an increase of 25 tpv was 125 trillion and 936 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively an increase of 33 

transaction revenues grew more slowly than tpv and the number of payment transactions in 2021 due primarily to a decline in ebay’s marketplace platform tpv where we had historically earned higher rates lower growth in foreign exchange fees a higher portion of tpv generated through braintree by bill pay partners large merchants and other marketplaces which generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volumes and an unfavorable impact from hedging changes in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2021 

revenues from other value added services 

revenues from other value added services increased by 433 million or 28 in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to increases in our revenue share with synchrony bank “synchrony” and fee revenue from the servicing of loans under the us government’s paycheck protection program “ppp” administered by the us small business administration “sba” and enacted in march 2020 under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act in response to the covid19 pandemic we do not own the receivables associated with loans originated through the ppp the fee revenue associated with the ppp loans in the year ended december 31 2021 was 157 million which included revenue recognized upon loan forgiveness and the extinguishment of our servicing obligations for a portion of the outstanding loans at december 31 2021 the remaining unearned fee revenue associated with the ppp loans was not material the growth in revenue from other value added services in the year ended december 31 2021 was also attributable to an increase in interest and fee revenue on our consumer loans receivable portfolio driven primarily by growth in international markets partially offset by a decline in interest and fee revenue on our merchant loans receivable portfolio due to a decrease in average outstanding loans yearoveryear and a decline in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting from lower interest rates 

the total gross consumer and merchant loans receivable balance as of december 31 2021 and 2020 was 53 billion and 36 billion respectively reflecting a yearoveryear increase of 48 driven primarily by growth in our consumer receivable portfolio due to the expansion of our installment credit products including the entry into new markets 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we took both proactive and reactive measures during 2020 to support our merchants and consumers that had loans and interest receivables due to us under our credit product offerings these measures were intended to help reduce financial difficulties experienced by our customers and included providing payment holidays to grant payment deferrals to certain borrowers for varying periods of time and amended payment terms through loan modifications in certain cases given the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic including its duration and severity related global economic conditions and the ultimate impact it may have on the financial condition of our merchants and consumers the extent of these types of actions and their prospective impact on our interest and fee income is not determinable in addition consumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to synchrony may experience similar hardships that result in increased losses recognized by synchrony which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned from synchrony in future periods in the event the overall return on the paypal branded credit programs funded by synchrony does not meet a minimum rate of return “minimum return threshold” in a particular quarter our revenue share for that period would be zero further in the event the overall return on the paypal branded credit programs managed by synchrony does not meet the minimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and in the following quarter we would be required to make a payment to synchrony subject to certain limitations through december 31 2021 the overall return on the paypal branded credit programs funded by synchrony exceeded the minimum return threshold 

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues no individual quarter in 2021 2020 or 2019 accounted for more than 30 of annual net revenue 



operating expenses 

the following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trends in each 



1 transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by tpv 

2 transaction and credit loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and credit losses by tpv 

 not meaningful 

transaction expense 

transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment these costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet we refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix” the cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a paypal or venmo account balance or our consumer credit products as we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers our funding mix may change which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate the cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs as we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit or debit cards outside the us our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix merchant mix regional mix funding mix and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions macroeconomic environment changes may also result in behavioral shifts in consumer spending patterns affecting the type of funding source they use which also impacts the funding mix 

transaction expense increased by 24 billion or 30 in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in tpv of 33 the decrease in transaction expense rate in 2021 compared to 2020 was due primarily to a decline in transaction expense rates associated with both our core paypal and braintree products offset by an increase in the share of volume associated with our braintree products for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 approximately 39 40 and 41 of tpv respectively was generated outside of the us 



transaction and credit losses 

transaction losses include the expense associated with our buyer and seller protection programs fraud and chargebacks credit losses include the losses associated with our merchant and consumer loans receivable portfolio beginning in 2020 these losses are based on current expected credit losses our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors including tpv product mix current and projected macroeconomic conditions including unemployment rates merchant insolvency events changes to and usage of our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants 

the components of our transaction and credit losses in millions for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows 

transaction and credit losses decreased by 681 million or 39 in 2021 compared to 2020 

transaction losses were 12 billion and 11 billion for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively reflecting an increase of 18 million or 2 yearoveryear transaction loss rate transaction losses divided by tpv was 009 012 and 015 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the increase in transaction losses was due primarily to growth in tpv partially offset by benefits realized from continued risk mitigation strategies which also contributed to a decrease in our transaction loss rate over the same period the duration and severity of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related global economic conditions remain unknown any negative impacts on macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of merchant bankruptcy insolvency business failure or other business interruption which may adversely impact our transaction losses particularly for merchants that sell goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use 

credit losses decreased by 699 million or 115 in 2021 compared to 2020 the components of credit losses for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 were as follows in millions 



1 credit losses for the year end december 31 2019 were based on accounting guidance which was superseded by the adoption of accounting standards update 201613 financial instruments  credit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments “cecl” effective january 1 2020 

2 net chargeoffs includes the principal chargeoffs partially offset by recoveries for consumer and merchant receivables 

3 reserve build release represents change in allowance for principal receivables excluding foreign currency remeasurement and for 2020 impact of adoption of cecl 



the benefit in the year ended december 31 2021 was attributable to the net release of reserves for loans receivable due to improvements in both current and projected macroeconomic conditions including lower projected unemployment rates as well as improvements in the credit quality of loans outstanding partially offset by provisions for originations during the period allowances for our merchant and consumer portfolios included qualitative adjustments which took into account continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic conditions as well as uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrowers including uncertainty around the effectiveness of loan modification programs made available to merchants the credit losses in the year ended december 31 2020 were primarily associated with an increase in provisions for our loans receivable portfolio resulting from a reserve build driven by a sharp deterioration in macroeconomic projections reflecting the anticipated impact of the covid19 pandemic and provisions associated with originations both of which significantly increased our then current expected credit losses and to a lesser extent changes in credit quality during the period the increase in provisions associated with macroeconomic projections in the year ended december 31 2020 included qualitative adjustments to account for the impact of limitations in our expected credit loss models resulting from the extreme fluctuations in both the actual and projected macroeconomic conditions during the period as well as to incorporate varying degrees of merchant performance in the current environment and expected performance in future periods 

the consumer loans and interest receivable balance as of december 31 2021 and 2020 was 38 billion and 22 billion respectively representing a yearoveryear increase of 77 driven by growth of our installment credit products in international markets and the us and to a lesser extent growth of paypal credit in international markets approximately 53 and 77 of our consumer loans receivable outstanding as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively were due from consumers in the uk the decline in the percentage of consumer loans receivable outstanding in the uk at december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 was due to overall growth in the consumer loan portfolio particularly from installment credit products in other markets 

the following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance 



1 represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date as applicable 

2 net chargeoff rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses excluding fraud losses on consumer loans receivable as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivable balance during the period 

the net chargeoff rate at december 31 2020 benefited from payment holidays provided by the company as a part of our covid19 payment relief initiatives 

we offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and mediumsized businesses which we refer to as our merchant finance offerings total merchant loans advances and interest and fees receivable outstanding net of participation interest sold as of both december 31 2021 and 2020 were approximately 14 billion approximately 82 and 8 of our merchant receivables outstanding as of december 31 2021 were due from merchants in the us and uk as compared to approximately 81 and 10 as of december 31 2020 respectively 

the following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans advances and interest and fees receivable balance 



1 net chargeoff rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses excluding fraud losses on merchant loans and advances as a percentage of the average daily amount of merchant loans advances and interest and fees receivable balance during the period 



the increase in the percent of current merchant receivables decrease in percent of merchant receivables greater than 90 days outstanding and decrease in the net chargeoff rate for merchant receivables at december 31 2021 as compared to december 31 2020 were primarily due to the chargeoff of accounts that experienced financial difficulties as a result of the covid19 pandemic in the prior year as well as improved performance in the current year partially attributable to the below mentioned modifications to the acceptable risk parameters including tightening of eligibility terms 

beginning in the third quarter of 2020 we granted certain merchants loan modifications intended to provide them with financial relief and help enable us to mitigate losses the associated loans and interest receivable have been treated as troubled debt restructurings due to the borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and significant changes in their loan structure including repayment terms andor fee and rate structure 

modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our credit products in 2020 in response to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of a number of risk mitigation strategies including reduction of maximum loan size tightening eligibility terms and a shift from automated to manual underwriting of loans and advances these changes in acceptable risk parameters resulted in a decrease in originations in 2020 as compared to prepandemic levels we continue to evaluate and modify our acceptable risk parameters in response to the changing macroeconomic environment and such changes in 2021 have resulted in a gradual increase in originations over the past nine months while the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economic environment remains uncertain the longer and more severe the pandemic the more likely it may have a material adverse impact on our borrowing base which is primarily comprised of small and mediumsized merchants

customer support and operations costs increased 297 million or 17 in 2021 compared to 2020 the increase in 2021 was primarily attributable to increases in employeerelated expenses customer onboarding and compliance costs and contractors and consulting costs that support the growth of our active accounts and payment transactions 



sales and marketing 

sales and marketing includes costs incurred for customer acquisition business development advertising and marketing programs 

sales and marketing expenses increased 584 million or 31 in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher spending on marketing programs including targeted user incentives to promote increased user engagement and new user acquisition and to a lesser extent an increase in employeerelated expenses 

technology and development 

technology and development includes costs incurred in connection with the development of our payments platform new products and the improvement of our existing products including the amortization of software and website development costs incurred in developing our payments platform which are capitalized it also includes acquired developed technology and our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our payments platform 

technology and development expenses increased 396 million or 15 in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to increases in cloud computing services utilized in delivering our products costs related to contractors and consultants and to a lesser extent amortization expense associated with internally developed software 



general and administrative 

general and administrative includes costs incurred to provide support to our business including legal human resources finance risk and compliance executive and other support operations 

general and administrative expenses increased 44 million or 2 in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to increases in employeerelated expenses and costs associated with enterprise software services partially offset by a decline in professional services expenses 

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of restructuring expenses 

restructuring and other charges decreased by 77 million in 2021 compared to 2020 

during the first quarter of 2020 management approved a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce as part of a multiphase process to reorganize our workforce concurrently with the redesign of our operating structure which spanned multiple quarters during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 the associated restructuring changes were 27 million and 109 million respectively we primarily incurred employee severance and benefits costs as well as other associated consulting costs under the 2020 strategic reduction substantially all of which have been accrued as of the second quarter of 2021 

for information on the associated restructuring liability see “note 17—restructuring and other charges” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

additionally in 2021 and 2020 we incurred asset impairment charges of 26 million and 30 million respectively due to exiting certain leased properties which resulted in a reduction of certain rightofuse lease assets and related leasehold improvements 

other income expense net 

other income expense net decreased 19 billion or 109 in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to lower net gains on strategic investments of 46 million in 2021 compared to 19 billion in 2020 



income tax benefit expense 

our effective tax rate was 2 in 2021 and 17 in 2020 the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2021 was primarily the result of a decrease in tax expense related to the intragroup transfers of intellectual property an increase in tax benefits associated with stockbased compensation deductions and a decrease in tax expense associated with lower net gains on strategic investments see “note 16—income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information on our effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

we require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations including customer protection programs our credit products capital expenditures investments in our business potential acquisitions and strategic investments working capital and other cash needs we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and investments cash expected to be generated from operations and our expected access to capital markets together with potential external funding through third party sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next twelve months and beyond 

sources of liquidity 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 

the following table summarizes our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2021 and 2020 



1 excludes assets related to funds receivable and customer accounts of 361 billion and 334 billion as of december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively

a significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers’ requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our businesses but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries accordingly not all of our cash is available for general corporate purposes 

cash flows

available credit and debt 

in september 2019 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” that provides for an unsecured 50 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that includes a 150 million letter of credit subfacility and a 500 million swingline subfacility with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time as of december 31 2021 no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement and as such 50 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the credit agreement subject to customary conditions to borrowing

for additional information see “note 12—debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

depending on market conditions we may from time to time issue debt including in private or public offerings to fund our operating activities finance acquisitions make strategic investments repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program or reduce our cost of capital 

we have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes the arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution “aggregate cash deposits” the arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreedupon limit the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement as of december 31 2021 we had a total of 35 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our 35 billion in aggregate cash deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement 



credit ratings 

as of december 31 2021 we continue to be rated investment grade by standard and poor’s financial services llc fitch ratings inc and moody’s investors services inc we expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance including our capital structure and results of operations our goal is to be rated investment grade but as circumstances change there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading if that were to occur it could increase our borrowing rates including the interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreement 

current and future cash requirements 

our material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential operating activities credit products customer protection programs stock repurchases strategic investments acquisitions other commitments and capital expenditures and other future obligations 

credit products 

growth in our portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs and any inability to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business we continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding for our loans receivable portfolio 

in june 2018 the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” agreed that paypal’s management may designate up to 35 of european customer balances held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used for european and us credit activities during the first quarter of 2021 an additional 700 million was approved to fund such credit activities as of december 31 2021 the cumulative amount approved by management to be designated for credit activities aggregated to 27 billion and represented approximately 27 of european customer balances that have been made available for our corporate use at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the cssf we may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances if necessary based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements while our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal under certain exceptional circumstances corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our european customer balances 

in april 2020 paypal was approved to participate in the ppp administered by the sba the program was designed to provide a direct incentive for small businesses to keep their workers on payroll during the covid19 pandemic and includes initial loan repayment deferrals and debt forgiveness provisions for eligible borrowers loans made under this program are funded by an independent chartered financial institution that we partner with and the related receivables are not purchased by paypal we receive a fee for providing origination services and loan servicing for the loans and retain operational risk related to those activities 

customer protection programs 

the risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers merchants and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations in and changes or modifications to the programs including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report our transaction loss rates have ranged between 009 and 015 of tpv historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results the duration and severity of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related global economic conditions remain unknown the negative impacts on macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of merchant bankruptcy insolvency business failure or other business interruption which may result in an adverse impact on our transaction losses particularly for merchants that sell goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use 

stock repurchases 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we repurchased approximately 34 billion of our common stock in the open market under our stock repurchase program authorized in july 2018 as of december 31 2021 a total of approximately 51 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our july 2018 stock repurchase program for additional information see “note 14—stock repurchase programs” to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 



acquisitions 

in october 2021 we completed the acquisition of paidy inc “paidy” for approximately 27 billion consisting of approximately 26 billion in cash and approximately 161 million in assumed restricted stock and restricted stock units subject to vesting conditions paidy is a twosided payments platform that primarily provides buy now pay later solutions installment credit offerings in japan with the acquisition of paidy we intend to expand our capabilities and relevance in japan in 2021 we completed four other acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of 542 million consisting primarily of cash consideration for additional information see “note 4—business combinations” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

other commitments 

in 2020 we announced our commitment to invest 535 million to support racial equality as of december 31 2021 we have deployed substantially all the commitment through charitable contributions grants to small businesses internal investments to support and strengthen diversity and inclusion initiatives and an economic opportunity fund focused on bolstering our relationships with community banks and credit unions serving underrepresented minority communities as well as investing directly into black and minorityled startups and minorityfocused investment funds among other initiatives 

future obligations 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 41 billion of unused credit was available to paypal credit account holders compared to 30 billion of unused credit as of december 31 2020 substantially all of the paypal credit account holders with unused credit are in the uk while this amount represents the total unused credit available we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our paypal credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time in addition the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination based on among other things account usage and customer creditworthiness 

we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes changes in our business needs contractual cancellation provisions fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from our estimates we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2021 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations 



the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows 

• purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising capital expenditures computer equipment software applications engineering development services and construction contracts data center and cloud computing services and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business 

• operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our noncancelable operating leases including leases not yet commenced primarily for office and data center facilities the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early 

• transition tax represents the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the tax act 



• longterm debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments based on contractual interest rates on our fixedrate debt for more information see “note 12—debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits net the table above does not include 16 billion of such noncurrent liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 

other considerations 

our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating our financial performance and global credit market conditions as well as a broad range of other factors including those related to the covid19 pandemic discussed in this form 10k in addition our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see “item 1a risk factors” and “note 13—commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces 

critical accounting polices and estimates 

the application of us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements an accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in “note 1 — overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10 ‑ k 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is available to reasonably estimate the impact and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability for all these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and such estimates require regular review and adjustment 

allowance for transaction and credit losses 

transaction and credit losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud chargebacks and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors including total tpv product mix current and projected macroeconomic conditions including unemployment rates merchant insolvency events changes to and usage of our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products which include revolving and installment credit products offered to consumers at checkout and merchant loans and advances arising from the paypal working capital “ppwc” and paypal business loan “ppbl” products 

we establish allowances for negative customer balances and estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchantrelated chargebacks due to nondelivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items buyer protection program claims account takeovers and automated clearing house returns additions to the allowance in the form of provisions are reflected in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances internal factors including experience with similar cases historical trends involving collection and writeoff patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types as well as current and projected macroeconomic factors as appropriate 



we also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivable this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the allowance is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio which is segmented by factors such as geographic region delinquency and vintage loss curves are generated using historical loss data for each loan portfolio and are applied to segments of each portfolio categorized by factors such as geographic region first borrowing versus repeat borrowing delinquency credit rating and vintage which vary by portfolio we then apply macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment and benchmark credit card chargeoff rates which are sourced externally using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period we utilize externally sourced macroeconomic scenario data to supplement our historical information due to the limited period in which our credit product offerings have been in existence projected loss rates inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors are applied to the principal amount of our consumer and merchant receivables we also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses our consumer receivables consist of revolving products which do not have a contractual term and installment products the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products installment products and merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates which approximates the estimated life of the loans is approximately 2 years approximately 7 months to 25 years and approximately 25 to 35 years respectively in 2020 the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving consumer products was based only on externally sourced data due to the lack of availability of historical data and in 2021 it was updated to reflect historical loss experience with the portfolio the allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography delinquency and period of origination among other factors 

determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit losses at the balance sheet date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts these forecasts project scenarios such as future unemployment and benchmark credit card chargeoff rates as of december 31 2021 we utilized externally published projections of the us and uk forecasted unemployment rates over the reasonable and supportable forecast period as of december 31 2020 we utilized externally published projections of the us forecasted credit card chargeoff rates and uk forecasted unemployment rates over the reasonable and supportable forecast period the overall principal and interest coverage ratio as of december 31 2021 and 2020 was approximately 9 and 23 respectively a significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factors could result in a material change in our allowances our allowance as of december 31 2021 took into account continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic conditions and uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrowers including uncertainty around the effectiveness of loan modification programs made available to merchants our allowance as of december 31 2020 took into account for the proactive and reactive measures that we took to help reduce financial difficulties experienced by our customers limitations in our expected credit loss models that arose due to the extreme fluctuations in both the actual and forecasted macroeconomic conditions in the period varying degrees of merchant performance in the current environment as well as expected future performance and to account for payment holidays granted we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these actions which may result in adjustments to our allowance for loans and interest receivable in future periods an increase of 1 in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowances by approximately 53 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of december 31 2021 

accounting for income taxes 

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax laws and regulations our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the us through provisions such as the gilti tax and base erosion antiabuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations 



deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors including our historical experience and shortrange and longrange business forecasts to the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized we record a valuation allowance 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with us gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return us gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest and penalties where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

based on our results for the year ended december 31 2021 a onepercentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately 41 million 

loss contingencies 

we are currently involved in various claims regulatory and legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective and are based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims litigation or other violations and may revise our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may differ materially from the actual outcomes 

revenue recognition 

application of the accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer or consideration payable on behalf of a customer requires judgment incentives determined to be made to a customer or payable on behalf of a customer are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated or amortized and goodwill our estimates are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity investment risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing funding and foreign currency derivative activities intended to mitigate market risks we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 approximately 40 and 30 respectively of our total cash cash equivalents and investment portfolio excluding restricted cash and strategic investments was held in cash and cash equivalents the assets underlying the customer balances that we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits time deposits and availableforsale debt securities we seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in certain jurisdictions where we operate equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances we do not pay interest on amounts due to customers 

if interest rates increased by 100 basis points the fair value of our availableforsale debt securities investment portfolio would have decreased by approximately 272 million and 173 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

as of december 31 2021 we had 90 billion in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates since these notes bear interest at fixed rates they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change as of december 31 2021 we also had revolving credit facilities of approximately 52 billion available to us we are obligated to pay interest on borrowings under these facilities as well as other customary fees including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating borrowings under these facilities if any bear interest at floating rates as a result we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest rate to the extent of our borrowings as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 98 million outstanding under these credit facilities no amounts were outstanding as of december 31 2020 for additional information see “note 12—debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us or to lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for loans and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may adversely impact our financial results we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services our cash flows results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities we are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the united states “us” dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts please see “note 10—derivative instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 



we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings and our investment in a foreign subsidiary from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow and net investment hedges for accounting purposes the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings the accumulated gains and losses associated with the net investment hedge will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated at which point they will be reclassified into earnings 

we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 20 at december 31 2021 and 2020 the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 10 billion and 11 billion lower respectively if the us dollar strengthened by 20 at december 31 2021 and 2020 the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 10 billion and 11 billion higher respectively 

we have an additional foreign currency exchange management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts 

adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 386 million and 353 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively without considering the offsetting effect of foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2021 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 400 million resulting in a net positive impact of approximately 14 million foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2020 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 369 million resulting in a net positive impact of approximately 16 million these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term 

equity investment risk 

our strategic investments are subject to a variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio as of both december 31 2021 and 2020 our strategic investments totaled 32 billion which represented approximately 20 and 17 of our total cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investment portfolio at each of those respective dates our strategic investments include marketable equity securities which are publicly traded and nonmarketable equity securities which are primarily investments in privately held companies we are required to record all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our consolidated statements of income as such we anticipate volatility to our net income in future periods due to changes in fair value related to our investments in marketable equity securities and changes in observable prices related to our nonmarketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative these changes could be material based on market conditions a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the carrying value of our strategic investments which could be experienced in the near term would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 321 million to the carrying value of the portfolio as of december 31 2021 we review our nonmarketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent purchases and sales of securities and other publicly available data

protecting merchants and consumers 

protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is imperative to successfully competing and sustainably growing our business fraudulent activities such as account takeover identity theft including stolen financial information and counterparty malicious activities represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers as well as their payment partners we provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform we believe that these programs which help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty nonperformance are generally broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry as a result merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that the merchants would not incur if they used our payments services we also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for review up to 180 days posttransaction we believe that this protection is generally consistent with or better than that offered by other payments providers these programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers who will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item in the condition significantly as described and merchants who will receive payment for the product they deliver to the customer 

our ability to protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary endtoend payments platform and our ability to utilize the data from both sides of transactions on our twosided network specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments we believe mobile devices will continue to play a significant and increasing role in commerce including by creating the opportunities to make the payments ecosystem safer for example paypal uses data from mobile devices to help reduce financial and fraud risk to merchants and consumers our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having paypal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands 

competition 

the global payments industry is highly competitive continuously changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight we compete against a wide range of businesses some of our current and potential competitors may be larger than we are have larger customer bases greater brand recognition longer operating histories a dominant or more secure position broader geographic scope volume scale resources and market share than we do or offer products and services that we do not offer other competitors are smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies emerging competitors business alliances shifting consumer habits and user needs price sensitivity on the part of merchants and consumers and frequent introductions of new products and services 

we differentiate ourselves to merchants through our ability to innovate and develop products and services that offer new payment experiences for our merchants demonstrate that they may achieve incremental sales by using and offering our services to consumers support transactions on our payments platform across varied technologies and payment methods through the simplicity and transparency of our fee structure and our seller protection programs in addition we differentiate ourselves to consumers through the ability to use our products and services across multiple commerce channels including ecommerce mobile and payments at the point of sale and without sharing their financial information with the merchant or any other party they are paying our customer service dispute resolution and buyer protection programs and our ability to simplify and personalize shopping experiences we believe that we compare favorably to our competitors with respect to these factors and we invest resources towards improving our products and services offering choice in payment options providing excellent customer service and building brands that merchants and consumers trust 

our business faces competition from a wide range of businesses and from all forms of physical and electronic payments we face competition from banks and financial institutions which provide traditional payment methods particularly credit cards and debit cards collectively “payment cards” electronic bank transfers and credit payment networks that facilitate payments for payment cards or proprietary retail networks payment card processors and “card on file” services we also face competition from providers offering a variety of payment products and services including tokenized and contactless payment cards digital wallets and mobile payments solutions credit installment or other buy now pay later methods realtime payment systems p2p payments and money remittance services card readers and other devices or technologies for payment at point of sale virtual currencies and distributed ledger technologies and tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants our products and services face competition from all forms of payments which include paperbased payments primarily cash and checks credit cards debit cards electronic bank transfers credit installment methods digital wallets and mobile payment solutions contactless payments including contactless cards tokenized cards near field communication “nfc” based solutions and qr codebased solutions and virtual currencies such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins

government regulation 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry including countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy cybersecurity and consumer protection the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation new or changing laws and regulations including changes to their interpretation or implementation as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition we monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate 

payments regulation various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the us and internationally in the us paypal inc a whollyowned subsidiary holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in the states where such licenses are required as well as in the district of columbia and certain territories these licenses include not only the paypal branded products and services offered in these locations but also our venmo hyperwallet and xoom products and services to the extent offered in these locations as a licensed money transmitter paypal is subject to among other requirements restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds reporting requirements bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies in certain cases these licenses also generally cover paypal’s service enabling customers to buy hold and sell cryptocurrency directly from their paypal account which is currently available only in the us in the state of new york paypal has obtained a conditional virtual currency license from the new york department of financial services to offer cryptocurrency services in the state in partnership with paxos trust company outside the us we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries the activities of those nonus entities are or may be supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate among other regulatory authorities the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” the australian prudential regulation authority the people’s bank of china the monetary authority of singapore the reserve bank of india the central bank of russia and the central bank of brazil have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions this list is not exhaustive and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change 



in addition financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us and the european union “eu” have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs make it more difficult for new customers to join paypal and reduce the ease of use of our products 

banking agency supervision  we serve our customers in the eu through paypal europe sàrl et cie sca a whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg by the cssf consequently we must comply with rules and regulations of the european banking industry including those related to capitalization funds management corporate governance antimoney laundering disclosure reporting and inspection we are or may be subject to bankingrelated regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry in addition based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions we are or may be subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators 

lending regulation  paypal’s us consumer shortterm installment loan product is subject to state lending laws some of which require licensure andor state regulator notification state collection laws as well as compliance with the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b as implemented by the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” and other applicable laws and regulations 

consumer financial protection bureau  the cfpb has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the us including consumer credit deposits payments and similar products as a large market participant of remittance transfers the cfpb has direct supervisory authority over our business the cfpb and similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business 

antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing and sanctions paypal is subject to antimoney laundering “aml” laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities our aml program is designed to prevent our payments platform from being used to facilitate money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activities or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets controls “ofac” and equivalent authorities in other countries our aml and sanctions compliance programs overseen by our amlbank secrecy act officer is composed of policies procedures and internal controls and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks 

interchange fees interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions for example in the eu the multilateral interchange fee “mif” regulation caps interchange fees for credit and debit card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with payment card transactions including paypal as a result the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge 

data protection and information security we are subject to a number of laws rules directives and regulations “privacy and data protection laws” relating to the collection use retention security processing and transfer collectively “processing” of personally identifiable information about our customers our merchants’ customers and employees “personal data” in the countries where we operate our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders as a result much of the personal data that we process which may include certain financial information associated with individuals is subject to one or more privacy and data protection laws in one or more jurisdictions in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between or among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relationships the eu has adopted a comprehensive general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which came into effect in may 2018 gdpr expanded the scope of the eu data protection law to foreign companies processing personal data of european economic area “eea” individuals and imposed a stricter data protection compliance regime in the us we are subject to privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act as well as the california consumer privacy act which requires privacy protections comparable to those afforded by the gdpr as well as the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program in europe the operations of our luxembourg bank are subject to confidentiality and information safeguarding requirements under the luxembourg banking act 



paypal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of eea individuals to the us including reliance on binding corporate rules “bcrs” for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and standard contractual clauses “sccs” paypal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of paypal’s eea customers andor employees outside of the eea have compliant transfer mechanisms in july 2020 the european court of justice “ecj” invalidated the useu privacy shield  safe harbor framework that was previously relied upon by some paypal vendors and paypal entered into sccs with those third parties paypal did not certify under the privacy shield regime and continues to use sccs and bcrs as the primary cross border data transfer mechanisms however the ecj ruling made clear that these transfer mechanisms will be subject to additional scrutiny as well to the extent paypal relies on sccs or any third party relies on the privacy shield regime for the compliant transfer of personal data paypal’s ability to process eea personal data to such parties could be jeopardized 

regulatory scrutiny of privacy data protection cybersecurity practices and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world regulatory authorities are continuously considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals and interpretive guidelines that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux 

anticorruption paypal is subject to applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act and similar laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate anticorruption laws generally prohibit offering promising giving accepting or authorizing others to provide anything of value either directly or indirectly to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage such as to obtain or retain business we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations 

additional regulatory developments various regulatory agencies continue to examine and implement laws governing a wide variety of issues including virtual currencies identity theft account management guidelines disclosure rules cybersecurity and marketing which may impact paypal’s business

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully review this section in addition to the other information appearing in this form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business   if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected 



coronavirus pandemic risks 

the novel coronavirus “covid19” pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect that the spread of covid19 as a global pandemic may have the ultimate extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain difficult to predict and subject to change including but not limited to the duration scope severity and geographic spread of the outbreak its impact on the global economy actions taken to contain or limit the impact of covid19 such as the availability of an effective vaccine or treatment geographic variation in how countries and states are handling the pandemic and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions may potentially resume 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact the operations of our customers suppliers vendors and other business partners and may adversely impact our results of operations in the future crossborder and domestic commerce may be adversely impacted by measures taken by government authorities and businesses globally to contain and limit the outbreak’s spread including travel restrictions border closures quarantines shelter in place and lock down orders mask and social distancing requirements and business limitations and shutdowns to the extent that such mitigation measures remain in place or are reinstated for significant periods of time they may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations actions that we have taken or may take in the future intended to assist customers impacted by covid19 may negatively impact our results of operations in particular we have experienced and may continue to experience adverse financial impacts from a number of operational factors including but not limited to 

• merchants selling goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery eg travel and events verticals or experiencing bankruptcy insolvency business failure or other business interruption which could result in our becoming liable to the buyers of such goods or services through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payments 

• merchants who utilize paypal branded merchant credit products such as paypal working capital and paypal business loan products or consumers who utilize paypal branded consumer credit products defaulting on their payment obligations 

• increased cybersecurity and payment fraud risk related to covid19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption in light of increased online banking ecommerce and other online activity 

• challenges to the availability and reliability of our products and services resulting from changes to our normal operations including due to one or more clusters of covid19 cases occurring at our or our service providers’ sites or mandatory local lockdown requirements which may impact our employees our level of customer service andor the systems or employees of our customers and business partners and 

• an increased volume of customer requests for support and regulatory requests for information and support or additional regulatory requirements which could require additional resources and costs to address 

additionally covid19 has negatively impacted the financial viability and operations of merchants in certain verticals such as travel and events and as a result allowances for transaction and credit losses may not accurately reflect the amount of losses that paypal may be exposed to by these merchants further we may not have the ability to accurately forecast the magnitude of such losses or any additional merchant segments that could be adversely impacted by covid19 

our business has benefited from the shift from instore shopping and traditional payment methods towards ecommerce and digital payments including a significant increase in net new active accounts and payments volume to the extent that customer preferences revert to precovid19 behaviors as mitigation measures to limit the spread of covid19 are lifted or relaxed and an effective vaccine or treatments for covid19 becomes available our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the significant increase in the number of our employees who are working remotely as a result of the pandemic and an extended period of remote work arrangements and subsequent reintroduction into the workplace could introduce operational risk increase cybersecurity risk strain our business continuity plans negatively impact productivity and give rise to claims by employees or otherwise adversely affect our business additionally covid19 could require new or modified processes procedures and controls to respond to changes in our business environment we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities 



the impacts of covid19 individually or collectively could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section 

cybersecurity and technology risks 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to systems and information including customers’ personal data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target unauthorized parties have attempted and we expect that they will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including but not limited to hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers partners or vendors and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems including employees and customers into disclosing user names passwords payment card information or other sensitive information this information may in turn be used to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our information technology systems and those of third parties with whom we partner numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks cyberextortion spear phishing and social engineering schemes the introduction of computer viruses or other malware and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure and those of third parties with whom we partner could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance insider threats system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities we believe that paypal is a particularly attractive target due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services 

any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers partners or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects for example in november 2017 we suspended the operations of tio networks “tio ”  acquired in july 2017 as part of an investigation of security vulnerabilities of the tio platform in december 2017 we announced that we had identified evidence of unauthorized access to tio’s network and the potential compromise of personally identifiable information for approximately 16 million tio customers this incident resulted in governmental inquiries and civil claims against us and may lead to additional inquiries and claims in the future 

under payment card network rules and our contracts with our payment processors if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses cybersecurity breaches and security vulnerabilities could subject us to significant costs and liabilities result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws require us to change our business practices cause us to incur significant remediation costs lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services damage our reputation and brands divert the attention of management from the operation of our business or result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to or claims by them while we maintain insurance policies our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses caused by security breaches 

business interruptions or systems failures may impair the availability of our websites applications products or services or otherwise harm our business 

our systems and operations and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future business interruptions or degradation because of distributed denialofservice and other cyberattacks insider threats hardware and software defects or malfunctions human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires and other natural disasters public health crises including pandemics power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events our corporate headquarters are located in the silicon valley a seismically active region in california a catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures to resume or maintain operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally some of our systems including those of companies we have acquired are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events as a provider of payments solutions we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plans and rigorous testing of such plans which may be costly and timeconsuming to implement and may divert our resources from other business priorities 



we have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures denialofservice attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and services these events have resulted and likely will continue to result in loss of revenue a prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability speed or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could permanently harm our relationship with our customers and partners and our reputation moreover if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims even if unsuccessful would likely be timeconsuming and costly for us to address and could have other consequences described in this “risk factors” section under the caption “ cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition ” 

our payments platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability we have undertaken and continue to undertake certain system upgrades and replatforming efforts designed to improve our reliability resiliency and speed these efforts are costly and timeconsuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fines and penalties and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business 

we also rely on facilities components applications and services supplied by third parties including data center facilities and cloud storage services from time to time such third parties have ceased to provide us with such facilities and services if these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions including a cybersecurity incident breach their agreements with us or fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which could result in customer dissatisfaction regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation and brands and materially and adversely affect our business while we maintain business interruption insurance it may not be sufficient to reimburse us for losses caused by interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events 

in addition any failure to successfully implement new information systems and technologies or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies in a timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business internal controls including internal controls over financial reporting results of operations and financial condition 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services the use of our products and services and consequently our revenues could decline 

rapid significant and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate for example payment technologies including realtime payments payment card tokenization virtual currencies distributed ledger and blockchain technologies and proximity payment technology such as nfc and other contactless payments internet browser technologies that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or ecommerce website artificial intelligence and machine learning developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations and instore digital mobile and social commerce 

we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies these third parties may restrict or prevent our access to or utilization of those technologies as well as their platforms or products we may not be able to accurately predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require significant investment take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be limited or restricted by industrywide standards platform providers payments networks changes to laws and regulations changing expectations of consumers or merchants thirdparty intellectual property rights and other factors our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable to do so in a timely or costeffective manner our business could be harmed 



legal regulatory and compliance risks 

our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight our failure to comply with extensive complex overlapping and frequently changing rules regulations and legal interpretations could materially harm our business 

our business is subject to complex and changing laws rules regulations policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate including but not limited to those governing banking credit deposit taking crossborder and domestic money transmission prepaid access foreign currency exchange privacy and data protection data governance cybersecurity banking secrecy digital payments and cryptocurrency payment services including payment processing and settlement services fraud detection consumer protection antitrust and competition economic and trade sanctions antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing 

regulators globally have been establishing and increasing their regulatory authority oversight and enforcement in ways that impact our business as we introduce new products and services and expand into new markets including through acquisitions we may become subject to additional regulations restrictions and licensing requirements as we expand and localize our international activities we expect that our obligations in the markets in which we operate will continue to increase in addition because we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws which may impose different more specific or conflicting obligations on us as well as broader liability 

any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of any government authority including changes to or expansion of their interpretation may subject us to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions result in additional compliance and licensure requirements cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business increase regulatory scrutiny of our business divert management’s time and attention from our business restrict our operations lead to increased friction for customers force us to make changes to our business practices products or operations require us to engage in remediation activities or delay planned transactions product launches or improvements any of the foregoing could individually or in the aggregate harm our reputation damage our brands and business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the complexity of us federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

payments regulation 

in the us paypal inc a whollyowned subsidiary holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in the states where such licenses are required as well as in the district of columbia and certain territories as described further in “item 1 business – government regulation” of this form 10k if we violate the laws or regulations covered under our licenses we could be subject to liability andor additional restrictions forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states forced to change our business practices or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals which could impose substantial costs 

while we currently allow our customers to send payments from approximately 200 markets we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets including the us to also receive payments in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds these limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets 

we principally provide our services to customers in the european union “eu” and the united kingdom “uk” through paypal europe sà rl et cie sca “paypal europe” our whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in luxembourg paypal europe is potentially subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates applicable requirements imposed on luxembourg credit institutions additionally compliance with eu laws and regulations could become more costly and operationally difficult to manage due to potentially inconsistent interpretations and domestic regulations by eu member countries european directives such as the revised payment services directive “psd2” enabling payment and account information sharing by regulated payment providers could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks if the business activities of paypal europe exceed certain thresholds or if the european central bank “ecb” determines paypal europe may be deemed a significant supervised entity and certain activity of paypal europe could become directly supervised by the ecb rather than by the cssf the luxembourg regulator which 



could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs 

in many of the other markets outside the us in which we do business we serve our customers through paypal pte ltd our whollyowned subsidiary based in singapore paypal pte ltd is supervised by the monetary authority of singapore “mas” but does not hold a remittance license as a result paypal pte ltd is not able to offer outbound remittance payments from singapore in many of the markets other than singapore served by paypal pte ltd it is unclear and uncertain whether our singaporebased service is subject only to singapore law or if it is subject to the application of local laws whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service bank financial institution or otherwise the payment services act came into effect in singapore in january 2020 paypal pte ltd has submitted an application for a major payment institution license to the mas to continue to provide payments services it will continue to operate within a statutory transition period while the application is pending once paypal pte ltd obtains its license we will be required to comply with new regulatory requirements which will result in increased operational complexity and costs for our singapore and international operations 

in the additional markets in which we do business we provide our services to customers through a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight and we may be subject to significant fines or other enforcement actions if we violate applicable requirements from time to time we may also acquire entities subject to local payments regulatory supervision or oversight 

there are substantial costs and potential product and operational changes involved in maintaining and renewing licenses certifications and approvals and we could be subject to fines other enforcement actions and litigation if we are found to violate any of these requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to or decide to continue to apply for or obtain any licenses renewals certifications and approvals in any jurisdictions in certain markets we may rely on local banks or other partners to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency and local regulators may use their authority over such local partners to prohibit restrict or limit us from doing business the need to obtain or maintain licenses certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial additional costs delay or preclude planned transactions product launches or improvements require significant and costly operational changes impose restrictions limitations or additional requirements on our business products and services or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market 

lending regulation 

paypal’s us consumer shortterm installment loan product is subject to state lending laws some of which require licensure andor state regulator notification state collection laws as well as compliance with the equal credit opportunity act and regulation b as implemented by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” and other applicable laws and regulations changes to state laws and regulatory interpretation may require us to make product changes incur substantial additional costs or cease lending in a particular state we could be subject to fines other enforcement action and litigation if we are found to violate any aspects of installment loan regulations 

consumer protection 

violations of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations including the electronic fund transfer act “efta” and regulation e as implemented by the cfpb could result in the assessment of significant actual damages or statutory damages or penalties including treble damages in some instances and plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees we are subject to and have paid amounts in settlement of lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the efta and regulation e or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices eg that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts 

the cfpb issued a final rule on prepaid accounts that came into effect on april 1 2019 we have implemented certain changes to comply with the final rule and made substantial changes to the design of certain us consumer accounts and their operability which could lead to unintended customer confusion and dissatisfaction discourage customers from opening new accounts require us to reallocate resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business 

paypal principally offers its services in the european economic area “eea” countries through a “passport” notification process through the luxembourg regulator in the case of paypal europe to regulators in other eea member states in accordance with eu regulations regulators in these countries could notify us of local consumer protection laws that apply to our business in addition to luxembourg consumer protection laws and could also seek to persuade the local regulator to order paypal to conduct its activities in the local country directly or through a branch office these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of or delay our ability to expand our business in europe 



antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing economic and trade sanctions 

regulators in the us and around the world continue to increase standards and expectations regarding antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing and expand the scope of existing laws and regulations to emerging products and markets which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program globally andor in specific jurisdictions including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage lead to increased friction for customers and result in a decrease in business regulators regularly reexamine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater compliance costs and impact our business in addition we are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the us the eu relevant eu member states and other jurisdictions in which we operate noncompliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations or economic and trade sanctions may subject us to significant fines penalties lawsuits and enforcement actions result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operations or damage our reputation and brands see “note 13—commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance program 

privacy and protection of customer data 

the legal and regulatory environment relating to “privacy and data protection laws” as defined in “item 1 business— government regulation” continues to develop and evolve in ways we cannot predict including with respect to technologies such as cloud computing artificial intelligence cryptocurrency and blockchain technology any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to users or with privacy and data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities government entities or others such proceedings or actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity which may require us to change our business practices increase the costs and complexity of compliance and materially harm our business in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers for further information regarding data protection and information security see “item 1 business—government regulation” 

paypal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of eea individuals to the us including binding corporate rules “bcrs” for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and standard contractual clauses “sccs” as approved by the european commission for transfers to and from third parties paypal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of paypal’s eea customers andor employees outside of the eea have compliant transfer mechanisms in july 2020 the european court of justice invalidated the privacy shield regime and raised several questions regarding the efficacy of sccs focusing on whether data transfers under sccs are consistent with the eu privacy principles to the extent paypal relies on sccs or any third party relies on the privacy shield regime for the compliant transfer of personal data paypal’s ability to process eea personal data to such parties could be jeopardized 

we are subject to regulatory activity and legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws 

we are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the us and internationally including in connection with proposed business combinations acquisitions and investments some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us individual states other countries or the eu or otherwise constitute unfair competition some regulators and legislators particularly those outside of the us may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive any claims or investigations even if without merit may be very expensive to defend or respond to involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in reputational harm significant judgments fines and remedial actions against us or require us to change our business practices make product or operational changes or delay or preclude planned transactions product launches or improvements 

we are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory actions and government inquiries 

we are regularly subject to claims individual and class action lawsuits government and regulatory investigations inquiries actions or requests and other proceedings alleging violations of laws rules and regulations with respect to competition antitrust intellectual property privacy data protection information security antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing sanctions anticorruption consumer protection fraud accessibility securities tax labor and employment commercial 



disputes services charitable fundraising contract disputes escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property product liability the matters described in “note 13—commitments and contingencies—litigation and regulatory matters—general matters” to our consolidated financial statements and other matters the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries may increase as our business expands in scale scope and geographic reach including through acquisitions of businesses and technology and our products and services increase in scale and complexity the legal proceedings are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operations and could result in substantial payments to satisfy judgments fines penalties or settlements negative publicity substantial diversion of management time and effort reputational harm criminal sanctions orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services requirements to change our business practices in costly ways develop noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or delay or preclude planned transactions product launches or improvements determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows 

third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights 

we are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights at any given time we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and subject to intellectual property infringement claims intellectual property infringement claims against us may result from among other things our expansion into new business areas including through acquisitions of businesses and technology the expansion in scope and complexity of our products and services and their convergence with technologies not previously associated with areas related to our business products and services the ultimate outcome of any allegation or claim is often uncertain and any such claim with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business and require us to among other things redesign or stop providing our products or services pay substantial amounts to settle claims or lawsuits satisfy judgments or pay substantial royalty or licensing fees 

we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which we offer our products and services although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction or that our contractual arrangements will prevent or deter third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property and third parties may independently develop equivalent or superior intellectual property rights we may be required to expend significant time and expense to prevent infringement and enforce our rights and we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights if we are unable to prevent third parties from using or offering technologies that infringe our patent or trade secret rights the uniqueness and value of our products and services could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business 

business and operations risks 

we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive continuously changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight many areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies shifting user preferences and needs price sensitivity of merchants and consumers and frequent introductions of new products and services competition also may intensify as new competitors emerge businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with various aspects of our business 

we compete with a wide range of businesses some of our current and potential competitors are larger operationally andor financially than we are have larger customer bases greater brand recognition longer operating histories a dominant or more secure position broader geographic scope volume scale resources and market share than we do or offer products and services that we do not offer which may provide them significant competitive advantages some competitors may also be 



subject to less burdensome regulatory requirements or may be smaller or younger companies that may be more agile and effective in responding quickly to user needs technological innovations and legal and regulatory changes these competitors may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of products and services andor offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs products and services we often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships to be important to our business competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish grow or maintain these partner relationships see “item 1 business—competition” of this form 10k for further discussion of the competitive environment in the markets where we operate if we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors drive value for our customers or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively in the market 

changes to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our business 

to process certain transactions we must comply with applicable payment card network bank or other network collectively “network” rules the rules govern all aspects of a transaction including fees and other practices from time to time the networks have increased the fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks certain of the networks have also imposed special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as the one that paypal offers our payment processors may have the right to pass any increases in fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing any increase in interchange fees special fees or assessments for transactions that we pay to our payment processors or the networks could make our pricing less competitive increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income which could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

in some jurisdictions government regulations have required the payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees any changes in interchange fee rates or limitations or their applicability to paypal could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional payment card service providers and the revenue we earn from our branded card programs require us to change our business practices and harm our business 

we may also be subject to fines assessed by the networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants the networks set and interpret their rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules such allegations may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business the network rules may also increase the cost of impose restrictions on or otherwise impact the development of our retail pointofsale solutions which may negatively affect their deployment and adoption the networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our payment processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement which could require us to make significant changes to our products if we become unable or limited in our ability to accept certain payment types such as debit or credit cards our business would be adversely affected 

changes in how consumers fund their paypal transactions could harm our business 

we pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts from an existing paypal account balance or venmo account balance or through our paypal branded consumer credit products our financial performance is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards which can significantly increase our costs although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing paypal account balance or venmo account balance to fund payment transactions some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards which may offer features and benefits not provided as part of their paypal accounts an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lowercost funding options could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business 

our ability to receive the benefit of our merchant lending offerings may be subject to challenge 

merchant loans and advances under our us paypal working capital “ppwc” and paypal business loan “ppbl” products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us and we acquire the receivables generated by those loans after origination in june 2020 largely in response to the madden v midland funding llc case decided in the us court of appeals for the second circuit the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” approved a final rule clarifying that loans originated by statechartered banks remain valid throughout the lifetime of the loan reflecting a similar rule finalized by the office of the comptroller of currency “occ” in may 2020 the final rule reaffirms and codifies in regulation the socalled “validwhenmade doctrine” which provides that the interest rate for a loan is determined when the 



loan is made and will not be affected by subsequent events such as sale assignment or other transfer a number of state attorneys general have challenged these fdic and occ rules and there remains some uncertainty whether nonbank entities purchasing loan receivables originated by fdicinsured state chartered industrial banks may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and other state laws an adverse outcome of these or similar challenges or changes to applicable laws and regulations could materially impact our us ppwc and ppbl products and our business 

our credit products expose us to additional risks 

we offer credit products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in the us and various international markets the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk the credit decisionmaking process for our consumer credit products uses proprietary methodologies and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on among other factors their past purchase and transaction history with paypal or venmo and their credit scores similarly proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our merchant lending offerings to help predict their ability to repay these risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions including those related to the particular consumer or merchant market conditions economic environment or limited transaction history or other data the accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements changes in consumer behavior changes in the economic environment issuing bank policies and other factors 

we generally rely on thirdparty chartered financial institutions to provide paypal and venmo branded consumer credit and merchant lending offerings to our us customers as a service provider to these thirdparty chartered financial institutions which are federally supervised us financial institutions we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators in the event of any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant credit products could be interrupted or limited which could materially and adversely affect our business we may be unable to reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution on favorable terms or at all obtaining licenses to originate such loans would be a costly timeconsuming and uncertain process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and require us to change our business practices 

we are subject to the risk that account holders who use our credit products will default on their payment obligations creating the risk of potential chargeoffs or negatively impacting our revenue share arrangement with synchrony bank the nonpayment rate among account holders may increase due to among other factors changes to underwriting standards risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a user worsening economic conditions such as a recession or government austerity programs increases in prevailing interest rates and high unemployment rates account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans 

we currently purchase receivables related to our merchant lending offerings in the us and extend credit for our consumer and merchants products outside the us through our international subsidiaries if we are unable to fund our credit business adequately or in a costeffective manner or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes the growth of our credit business could be negatively impacted 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business including networks banks payment processors and payment gateways that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions unaffiliated thirdparty lenders to originate our us paypal credit us merchant credit and branded credit card products our branded debit card products cryptocurrency custodial service providers and external business partners and contractors who provide key functions eg outsourced customer support and product development functions facilities information technology data center facilities and cloud computing these risks may include legal regulatory information security reputational operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party if we are unable to effectively manage our thirdparty relationships these third parties are unable to meet their obligations to us or we experience substantial disruptions in these relationships our operations results of operations and financial results could be adversely impacted additionally while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our financial legal reputational and operational risk 



any factors that reduce crossborder trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business 

crossborder trade ie transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries is an important source of our revenues and profits crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market in certain markets crossborder trade represents our primary and in some instances our only presence 

crossborder trade may be negatively impacted by various factors including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions in the context of crossborder trade and foreign exchange any factors that increase the costs of crossborder trade for us or our customers or that restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical such as trade policy or higher tariffs could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume negatively impact our revenues and profits and harm our business 

failure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transactions bad transactions and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services 

our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions and protect consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description we incur substantial losses from our buyer and seller protection programs as a result of claims from consumers we seek to recover losses from our buyer and seller protection programs from the merchant but may not fully recover them if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay or the transaction involves a fraudulent merchant in addition in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use eg airline cruise or concert tickets custommade goods and subscriptions we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services including through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payments allowances for transaction losses that we have established may be insufficient to cover incurred losses we also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase fraud erroneous transactions and customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments in addition consumers who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer which in turn will seek recovery from us if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive we could lose the ability to accept payment cards for payment which would negatively impact our business measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings if these measures do not succeed our business could be negatively impacted increases in our loss rate including as a result of changes to the scope of transactions covered by our buyer and seller protection programs could negatively impact our business see “note 13—commitments and contingencies— protection programs” to our consolidated financial statements 

use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business 

our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses including money laundering terrorist financing sanctions evasion illegal online gambling fraudulent sales of goods or services illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances piracy of software movies music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods in particular digital goods bank fraud child pornography human trafficking prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products securities fraud pyramid or ponzi schemes or the facilitation of other illegal or improper activity the use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses has subjected us and may subject us in the future to claims individual and class action lawsuits and government and regulatory requests inquiries or investigations that could result in liability and harm our reputation moreover certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods resulting in liability for us owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions including paypal that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm and any resulting liabilities loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business 

acquisitions strategic investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business 

we expect to continue to consider and evaluate a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including but not limited to business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses technologies services products and other assets strategic investments and commercial and strategic partnerships collectively “strategic 



transactions” at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions any of which could individually or in the aggregate be material to our financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities strategic transactions may involve additional significant challenges uncertainties and risks including but not limited to challenges of integrating new employees systems technologies and business cultures failure to develop the acquired business adequately disruption of our ongoing operations and diversion of our management’s attention inadequate data security cybersecurity and operational and information technology resilience failure to identify or our underestimation of commitments liabilities deficiencies and other risks associated with acquired businesses or assets and potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight and uncertain or evolving legal regulatory and compliance requirements potential reputational risks that could arise from transactions with or investments in companies involved in new or developing businesses or industries which may be subject to uncertain or evolving legal regulatory and compliance requirements failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and of its anticipated benefits to materialize potential impairment of goodwill or other acquisitionrelated intangible assets and the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities or significant additional debt strategic transactions may also heighten many of the risks described in this “risk factors” section these transactions are inherently risky may not be successful and may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations in addition we may be dependent on controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand 

our international operations subject us to increased risks which could harm our business 

our international operations generate approximately onehalf of our net revenues our international operations including any expansion in international markets subject us to significant challenges uncertainties and risks including but not limited to local regulatory licensing reporting and legal obligations costs and challenges associated with operating in markets in which we may have limited or no experience including effectively localizing our products and services and adapting them to local preferences difficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences and in light of varying laws regulations and customs difficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified company employees and maintaining our company culture fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates exchange control regulations profit repatriation restrictions potential tariffs sanctions fines or other trade barriers or restrictions import or export regulations compliance with us and foreign anticorruption antibribery sanctions antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions and national or regional political economic or social instability 

our international operations also may heighten many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section violations of the complex foreign and us laws rules and regulations that may apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibit or require us to change the way we conduct our business and damage our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks are inherent in our international operations may increase our costs of doing business internationally and could materially and adversely affect our business 

brexit the united kingdom’s departure from the eu could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

following the departure of the uk from the eu and the eea on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” and the expiration of a transition period on december 31 2020 there continues to be uncertainty over the practical consequences of brexit including the potential for brexit to contribute to longterm instability in financial stock and currency exchange markets greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the uk and eea region and a general deterioration in consumer sentiment and credit conditions leading to overall negative economic growth and increased risk of merchant default 

the consequences of brexit have brought legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms which could continue as national laws and regulations in the uk differ from eu laws and regulations and additional authorization requirements come into effect these developments have led to additional regulatory costs and challenges for us including 



• paypal europe operates in the uk within the scope of its passport permissions as they stood at the end of the transition period pursuant to the temporary permissions regime pending the grant of new uk authorizations by the uk financial regulators if we are unable to obtain the required authorizations before the expiry of the longstop dates set by the uk regulators under the temporary permissions regime our european operations could lose their ability to offer services into the uk market on a crossborder basis and 

• our european operations are required to comply with new legal and regulatory requirements in the uk that occasionally are in addition to or inconsistent with those of the eea in each case leading to increased complexity and costs 

global and regional economic conditions could harm our business 

adverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets including tightening in the credit markets extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets including the fixed income credit currency equity and commodity markets higher unemployment high consumer debt levels reduced consumer confidence or economic activity government fiscal and tax policies us and international trade relationships agreements treaties tariffs and restrictive actions the inability of a government to enact a budget in a fiscal year government shutdowns government austerity programs and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform additionally any inability to access the capital markets when needed due to volatility or illiquidity in the markets and increased regulatory liquidity and capital requirements may strain our liquidity position such conditions may also expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results see “item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – impact of foreign currency exchange rates and liquidity and capital resources” and “item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for additional information on our financial risks 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents receivables outstanding and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the us and international jurisdictions as part of our currency hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities we regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk despite these efforts we may be exposed to the risk of default by or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of these counterparty financial institutions if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited held in accounts with or otherwise due from such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

there are risks associated with our indebtedness 

we have incurred indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences including without limitation requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes including capital expenditures acquisitions and strategic investments reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business competition pressures and market conditions and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or other general corporate and other purposes 

our revolving credit facilities and the indenture for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict among other things our business and operations if we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period moreover any such acceleration and required repayment of or default in respect of our indebtedness could in turn constitute an event of default under other debt instruments thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 



changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected 

changes in tax laws exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities or implementation of recordkeeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

an increasing number of us states the us federal government and foreign jurisdictions as well as international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development and the eu commission are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes these actions may materially affect our effective tax rate 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by tax authorities in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities that differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements which may individually or in the aggregate materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient 

in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by the incurrence of losses or earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities including as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles or by certain discrete items 

a number of us states the us federal government and foreign jurisdictions have implemented and may impose reporting or recordkeeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance a number of jurisdictions are also reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes we have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and recordkeeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions and harm our business 

if the distribution of our common stock in connection with our separation from ebay together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes we and certain of our stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

on july 17 2015 we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by ebay inc of 100 of our outstanding common stock to ebay’s stockholders which we refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution” ebay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code notwithstanding the opinion of counsel the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that the distribution together with certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if the irs determines that any of these representations assumptions or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel if the distribution together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree ebay stockholders who received paypal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities 



there are risks associated with our relationship with ebay 

in connection with our separation from ebay we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with ebay and various other agreements including an operating agreement and agreements covering tax employee and intellectual property matters data sharing and product development these agreements determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and associated indemnification obligations and established certain commercial relationships between ebay and us if either we or ebay are unable to satisfy our performance payment or indemnification obligations under these agreements or other commercial agreements between the parties we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to ebay 

we expect the portion of our revenue and operating income attributable to ebay will continue to decline due to various factors including the speed and extent to which ebay intermediates payments on its platform and migrates ebay merchants to ebay’s managed payments platform limits the availability of paypal as a payment option offers or promotes alternative payment options directs transactions on its platforms to different providers of payment services or eliminates or modifies its risk management or customer protection programs on its platforms which could result in customer dissatisfaction reduction in ebay volume and other consequences adverse to our business if we are unable to generate sufficient business from our nonebay customers to offset the expected reduction in the portion of our business attributable to ebay the growth of our business and our ability to meet our longterm financial targets could be negatively impacted 

we may be unable to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business 

competition for key and other highly skilled personnel is intense especially for executive talent software engineers and other technology talent we may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration travel or availability of visas for skilled workers the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract hire train and retain highly qualified personnel effectively could harm our business and growth prospects 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services 

we may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through our online services including claims alleging defamation libel harassment hate speech breach of contract invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services among other things if the laws or regulations that provide protections for online dissemination of information are invalidated or are modified to reduce protections available to us and we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings which could harm our business

business environment 

the company 

we are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of merchants and consumers worldwide paypal is committed to democratizing financial services to improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world anytime on any platform and using any device when sending payments or getting paid we also facilitate persontoperson “p2p” payments through our paypal venmo and xoom products and services and simplify and personalize shopping experiences for our consumers through our honey platform our combined payment solutions including our core paypal paypal credit braintree venmo xoom izettle and hyperwallet products and services comprise our proprietary payments platform 

regulatory environment 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry including countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy cybersecurity and consumer protection the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation new or changing laws and regulations including the changes to their interpretation and implementation as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition we monitor these areas closely and are focused on designing compliant solutions for our customers 



information security 

information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have increased significantly in recent years although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage prevent data loss and other security incidents and effectively respond to known and potential risks and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections we remain subject to these risks and there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide sufficient security or prevent breaches or attacks for additional information regarding our information security risks see “item 1a risk factors— cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition ” 

covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus “covid19” as a pandemic the outbreak has resulted in government authorities and businesses throughout the world implementing numerous measures intended to contain and limit the spread of covid19 including travel restrictions border closures quarantines shelterinplace and lockdown orders mask and social distancing requirements and business limitations and shutdowns these measures have negatively impacted consumer and business spending and payments activity generally and have significantly contributed to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions and higher unemployment in some countries including those in which we have significant operations the spread of covid19 has caused us to make significant modifications to our business practices including enabling most of our workforce to work from home establishing strict health and safety protocols for our offices restricting physical participation in meetings events and conferences and imposing restrictions on employee travel we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that may alter our business practices as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers or business partners 

while the current macroeconomic environment as a result of the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted general consumer and merchant spending with a more pronounced impact on travel and events verticals the spread of covid19 has also accelerated the shift from instore shopping and traditional instore payment methods eg cash towards ecommerce and digital payments and resulted in increased customer demand for safer payment and delivery solutions eg contactless payment methods buy online and pick up in store and a significant increase in online spending in certain verticals that have historically had a strong instore presence on balance our business has benefited from these behavioral shifts including a significant increase in net new active accounts and payments volume to the extent that consumer preferences revert to precovid19 behaviors as mitigation measures to limit the spread of covid19 are lifted or relaxed our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the rapidly changing global market and economic conditions as a result of covid19 have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our operations and business the broader implications of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations remain uncertain for additional information on how covid19 has impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business see below for specific discussion in the respective areas and also refer to “part i item 1a risk factors” in this form 10k 

brexit 

the united kingdom “uk” formally exited the european union “eu” and the european economic area “eea” on january 31 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” with the expiration of a transition period on december 31 2020 paypal europe sàrl et cie sca “paypal europe” operates in the uk within the scope of its passport permissions as they stood at the end of the transition period under the temporary permissions regime pending the grant of new uk authorizations by the uk financial regulators we are currently unable to determine the longerterm impact that brexit will have on our business which will depend in part on the implications of new tariff trade and regulatory frameworks that now govern the provision of crossborder goods and services between the uk and the eea as well as the financial and operational consequences of the requirement for paypal europe to obtain new uk authorizations to operate its business longerterm within the uk market for additional information on how brexit could affect our business see “item 1a risk factors— brexit the united kingdom’s departure from the eu could harm our business financial condition and results of operations ” 



brexit may contribute to instability in financial stock and foreign currency exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro we have foreign currency exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2020 2019 and 2018 net revenues generated from our uk operations constituted 11 of total net revenues in 2020 2019 and 2018 net revenues generated from the eu excluding the uk constituted less than 20 of total net revenues approximately 50 and 37 of our gross loans and interest receivables as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively were due from customers in the uk approximately 14 and 6 of our gross loans and interest receivables as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively were due from customers in the eu excluding the uk the increase in the percentage of gross loans and interest receivable outstanding in the uk and eu as of december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by an increase in the balances in those regions as we continue to originate consumer loans in our international markets combined with a decline in our gross total loans and interest receivable outstanding due to minimal originations in our merchant credit portfolio as compared to 2019 

overview of results of operations 

the following table provides a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



all amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million except as otherwise noted as a result certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided 

 not meaningful 

1 prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period presentation refer to “note 1—overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional information 

net revenues increased 37 billion or 21 in 2020 as compared to 2019 driven primarily by growth in total payment volume “tpv” as defined below under “net revenues” of 31 our acquisition of honey science corporation “honey” contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate in 2020 

total operating expenses increased 31 billion or 21 in 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and to a lesser extent increases in technology and development expenses sales and marketing expenses transaction and credit losses and general and administrative expenses our acquisitions of honey and a 70 equity interest in guofubao information technology co gopay ltd “gopay” collectively contributed approximately five percentage points to the growth rate in total operating expenses in 2020 

operating income increased 570 million or 21 in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to growth in net revenues partially offset by an increase in operating expenses our operating margin was 15 in both 2020 and 2019 our acquisitions of honey and gopay collectively had a negative impact of approximately three percentage points to our operating margin which was offset by operating efficiencies 

net income increased by 17 billion or 71 in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the previously discussed increase in operating income of 570 million and an increase in other income expense net of 15 billion driven primarily by net gains on strategic investments partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of 324 million driven primarily by tax expense related to gains on strategic investments 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

we have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar in 2020 2019 and 2018 we generated approximately 49 47 and 46 of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the united states respectively because we generate substantial net revenues internationally we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the us including those discussed under “item 1a risk factors” 

we calculate the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency exchange movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings 

in the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 the yearoveryear foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar had the following impact on our reported results 



while we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure 

we also used a foreign currency exchange contract designated as a net investment hedge to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary gains and losses associated with this instrument will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated 

additionally in connection with our services that are paid for in multiple currencies we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities 



financial results 

net revenues 

our revenues are classified into the following two categories 

• transaction revenues  net fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis primarily based on the tpv completed on our payments platform growth in tpv is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform we earn additional fees on transactions where we perform currency conversion when we enable crossborder transactions ie transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their paypal or venmo account to their debit card or bank account and other miscellaneous fees 

• revenues from other value added services net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships referral fees subscription fees gateway fees and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers we also earn revenues from interest and fees earned primarily on our portfolio of loans receivable and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances 

our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following 

  

• the mix of merchants products and services 

• the mix between domestic and crossborder transactions 

• the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs and 

• the amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers 

active accounts number of payment transactions number of payment transactions per active account and tpv are key nonfinancial performance metrics “key metrics” that management uses to measure the performance of our business and are defined as follows 

• an active account is an account registered directly with paypal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our payments platform or through our honey platform not including gatewayexclusive transactions within the past 12 months a platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to paypal’s payments platform through such third party’s login credentials the number of active accounts provides management with additional perspective on the growth of accounts across our payments and honey platforms as well as the overall scale of our platforms 

• number of payment transactions are the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

• number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12month period divided by active accounts at the end of the period the number of payment transactions per active account provides management with insight into the number of times a customer is engaged in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period 

• tpv is the value of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

as our transaction revenue is typically correlated with tpv growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform the engagement level of our customers and underlying activity and trends which are indicators of current and future performance we present these key metrics to enhance investors’ evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results 



net revenue analysis 

the components of our net revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows in millions 

transaction revenues 

transaction revenues increased by 38 billion or 24 in 2020 compared to 2019 and were mainly attributable to our core paypal products and services due primarily to strong growth in tpv and the number of payment transactions both of which resulted primarily from an increase in our active accounts and to a lesser extent an increase in revenue from currency conversion fees 

the current macroeconomic environment as a result of the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted general consumer and merchant spending with a more pronounced impact on travel and events verticals however we have experienced strong growth in online retail gaming and food volume offsetting this decline 

the graphs below present the respective key metrics in millions for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

reflects active accounts at the end of the applicable period active accounts as of december 31 2020 includes 102 million active accounts contributed by honey on the date of acquisition in january 2020 

the following table provides a summary of related metrics 



 not meaningful 



transaction revenues grew more slowly than tpv which grew 31 and the number of payment transactions which grew 25 in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a higher proportion of p2p transactions primarily from our venmo products from which we earn lower fees a decline in hedging gains and a higher portion of tpv generated by platform partners and large merchants who generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volumes changes in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2020 

revenues from other value added services 

revenues from other value added services decreased by 137 million or 8 in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to a decline in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting from lower interest rates and a decrease in interest and fee income on our loans and advances receivable due to an increase in the allowance for expected credit losses against interest and fees receivable a decline in originations and payment holidays that we provided during the year to our customers as a part of our covid19 payment relief initiatives additionally the decline in revenues from other value added services was driven by a decline in revenue earned from transition servicing activities provided to synchrony bank “synchrony” which ended in the second quarter of 2019 this decline was partially offset by incremental revenues from our acquisition of honey which contributed approximately 15 percentage points to the revenue growth rate for other value added services in 2020 and an increase in our revenue share earned from synchrony 

the total gross consumer and merchant loans receivable balance as of december 31 2020 and 2019 was 36 billion and 42 billion respectively the yearoveryear decrease of 15 in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by a decline in our merchant receivable portfolio due to reduced originations partially offset by growth in our consumer receivable portfolio 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have taken both proactive and reactive measures to support our merchants and consumers that have loans and interest receivables due to us under our credit product offerings these measures were intended to reduce financial difficulties experienced by our customers and included providing payment holidays to grant payment deferrals to certain borrowers for varying periods of time and amended payment terms through loan modifications in certain cases these measures have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact the recognition of interest and fee income in future periods given the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic including its duration and severity and the ultimate impact it may have on the financial condition of our merchants and consumers the extent of these types of actions and their prospective impact on our interest and fee income is not determinable in addition consumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to synchrony may experience similar hardships that result in increased losses recognized by synchrony which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned from synchrony in future periods in the event the overall return on the paypal branded credit programs funded by synchrony does not meet a minimum rate of return “minimum return threshold” in a particular quarter our revenue share for that period would be zero further in the event the overall return on the paypal branded credit programs managed by synchrony does not meet the minimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and in the following quarter we would be required to make a payment to synchrony subject to certain limitations through december 31 2020 the overall return on the paypal branded credit programs funded by synchrony exceeded the minimum return threshold

transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment these costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction we refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix” the cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a paypal or venmo account balance or paypal credit as we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers our funding mix may change which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate the cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the us than in the us our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix merchant mix regional mix funding mix and assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding sources macroeconomic environment changes may also result in behavioral shifts in consumer spending patterns affecting the type of funding source they use which also impacts the funding mix 

transaction expense increased by 11 billion or 17 in 2020 compared to 2019 and was primarily attributable to an increase in tpv of 31 the decrease in transaction expense rate in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to favorable changes in product mix and funding mix for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 approximately 2 of tpv was funded with paypal credit for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 approximately 40 41 and 43 of tpv respectively was generated outside of the us 

transaction and credit losses 

transaction losses include the expense associated with our buyer and seller protection programs fraud and chargebacks credit losses include the losses associated with our merchant and consumer loans receivable portfolio beginning in 2020 these losses are based on current expected credit losses our transaction and credit losses fluctuate depending on many factors including tpv current and projected macroeconomic conditions including unemployment rates merchant insolvency events changes to and usage of our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants 



the components of our transaction and credit losses in millions for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 were as follows 

transaction and credit losses increased by 361 million or 26 in 2020 compared to 2019 

transaction loss rate transaction losses divided by tpv was 012 015 and 018 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

transaction losses increased by 43 million or 4 in 2020 compared to 2019 due to growth in tpv partially offset by benefits realized through improvements in risk management capabilities which also contributed to a decrease in our transaction loss rate over the same period the duration and severity of the impacts of the covid19 pandemic remain unknown the negative impact on macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of merchant bankruptcy insolvency business failure or other business interruption which may adversely impact our transaction losses particularly for merchants that sell goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use 

credit losses increased by 318 million or 110 in 2020 compared to 2019 due primarily to an increase in provisions for our loans and interest receivable associated with changes in current and projected macroeconomic conditions including qualitative adjustments to account for the impact of limitations in our expected credit loss models that have arisen due to the extreme fluctuations in both the actual and projected macroeconomic conditions during the period as well as to incorporate varying degrees of merchant performance in the current environment and expected performance in future periods our estimate of the macroeconomic impact on current expected credit losses is most significantly impacted by projected unemployment trends and benchmark credit card chargeoff rates which directly correlate to the forecast of loans and interest receivables that we expect to charge off in the future credit losses for the year ended december 31 2020 include the impact of the increase in actual unemployment rates and credit card chargeoff rates during the current period and expectations of a prolonged economic recovery period over which the value of loans and interest receivable that chargeoff are projected to exceed historical trends if the actual unemployment and chargeoffs vary from these projections as of december 31 2020 the credit losses recognized in future periods will be impacted 

the consumer loans and interest receivables balance as of december 31 2020 and 2019 was 22 billion and 13 billion respectively the yearoveryear increase of 64 in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to growth of paypal credit in international markets and to a lesser extent growth of our installment credit products in the us and international markets approximately 77 and 94 of our consumer loans receivables outstanding as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively were due from consumers in the uk

4 net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses excluding fraud losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the period 

the decrease in the net charge off rate for consumer receivables at december 31 2020 as compared to december 31 2019 was primarily attributable to the continued expansion and maturity of our international consumer loan receivable portfolio and was inpart favorably impacted in the current year by payment holidays provided by the company as a part of our covid19 payment relief initiatives 

we offer access to credit products for certain small and mediumsized merchants which we refer to as our merchant lending offerings total merchant loans advances and interest and fees receivable outstanding net of participation interest sold as of december 31 2020 and 2019 were 14 billion and 28 billion respectively the yearoveryear decrease of 51 in 2020 compared to 2019 was due primarily to a reduction in originations due to modifications in our acceptable risk parameters as well as a shift towards merchants borrowing through the us government’s paycheck protection program “ppp” administered by the us small business administration “sba” and enacted in march 2020 under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” in response to the covid19 pandemic we do not own the receivables associated with loans originated through the ppp approximately 81 and 10 of our merchant receivables outstanding as of december 31 2020 were due from merchants in the us and uk as compared to 83 and 10 as of december 31 2019 respectively

during the year ended december 31 2020 modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our credit products in response to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of a number of risk mitigation strategies including reduction of maximum loan size tightening eligibility terms and a shift from automated to manual underwriting of loans and advances these changes in acceptable risk parameters have resulted in a deceleration in the growth of our borrowing base and a decrease in merchant receivables as of december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 while the impact of covid19 on the economic environment remains uncertain the longer and more severe the pandemic the more likely it is to have a material adverse impact on our borrowing base which is primarily comprised of small and mediumsized merchants for additional information see “note 11—loans and interest receivable” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors— our credit products expose us to additional risks ” included in this form 10k

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

future liquidity and obligations 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 30 billion of unused credit was available to paypal credit account holders compared to 31 billion of unused credit as of december 31 2019 substantially all of the paypal credit account holders with unused credit are in the uk while this amount represents the total unused credit available we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all our paypal credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time in addition the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination based on among other things account usage and customer creditworthiness 

we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes changes in our business needs contractual cancellation provisions fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2020 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations 



the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows 

• purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising capital expenditures computer equipment software applications engineering development services and construction contracts data center and cloud computing services and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business 

• operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our noncancelable operating leases including leases not yet commenced primarily for office and data center facilities the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early 



• transition tax represents the onetime mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the tax cuts and jobs act 

• longterm debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments based on contractual interest rates on our fixedrate debt for more information see “note 12—debt” to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues no individual quarter in 2020 2019 or 2018 accounted for more than 30 of annual net revenue 

critical accounting polices and estimates 

the application of us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in “note 1 — overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is available to reasonably estimate the impact and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates require regular review and adjustment

we establish allowances for negative customer balances and estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchantrelated chargebacks due to nondelivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased items buyer protection program claims account takeovers and automated clearing house returns additions to the allowance in the form of provisions are reflected in transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances internal factors including experience with similar cases historical trends involving collection and writeoff patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types as well as current and projected macroeconomic factors as appropriate 



we also establish an allowance for loans and interest receivable which represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivable this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments the allowance is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio which is segmented by factors such as geographic region delinquency and vintage loss curves are generated using historical loss data for each loan portfolio and are applied to segments of each portfolio categorized by factors such as geographic region first borrowing versus reuse delinquency credit rating and vintage which vary by portfolio we then apply macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment and benchmark credit card chargeoff rates which are sourced externally using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period we utilize externally sourced macroeconomic scenario data to supplement our historical information due to the limited period in which our credit product offerings have been in existence projected loss rates inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors are applied to the principal amount of our consumer and merchant receivables we also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses our consumer receivables are primarily revolving in nature and do not have a contractual term however the reasonable and supportable forecast period we have included in our projected loss rates based on externally sourced data is approximately seven years our merchant receivables vary in contractual term however the reasonable and supportable forecast period we have considered for projected loss rates is approximately 25 to 35 years depending upon the product the allowance for credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography delinquency and period of origination among other factors 

determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowances for loans and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit losses at the balance sheet date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecasts these forecasts project scenarios such as future unemployment and benchmark credit card chargeoff rates as of december 31 2020 we utilized externally published projections of the us and uk forecasted unemployment rates and credit card chargeoff rates over the reasonable and supportable period indicating a slight increase in the first half of 2021 followed by a gradual decline and ultimate stabilization of these rates resulting in an overall principal and interest coverage ratio of approximately 23 the projected gradual decline in unemployment and credit card chargeoff rates is reflective of a prolonged recovery period where we expect to experience elevated chargeoff rates a significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factors could result in a material change in our allowances our allowance as of december 31 2020 has been adjusted to account for the proactive and reactive measures that we have taken that are intended to reduce financial difficulties experienced by our customers and other limitations in our expected credit loss models that have arisen due to the extreme fluctuations in both the actual and projected macroeconomic conditions during the period these qualitative adjustments were also made to incorporate varying degrees of merchant performance both in the current environment as well as expected future performance and to account for payment holidays granted our allowance as of december 31 2020 has not been adjusted to account for the potential impacts of the cares act which are also intended to help mitigate the negative impact the current pandemic may have on the financial condition of our customers we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these actions which may result in adjustments to our allowance for loans and interest receivable in future periods an increase of 1 in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowances by approximately 36 million based on the loans and interest receivable balance outstanding as of december 31 2020 

accounting for income taxes 

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax laws and regulations our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the us through provisions such as the gilti tax and base erosion antiabuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors including our historical experience and shortrange and longrange business forecasts to the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized we record a valuation allowance 



we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with us gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return us gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest and penalties where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

based on our results for the year ended december 31 2020 a onepercentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately 51 million 

loss contingencies 

we are currently involved in various claims regulatory and legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective and are based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims litigation or other violations and may revise our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may differ materially from the actual outcomes 

revenue recognition 

application of the accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated or amortized and goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets our estimates are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 



we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist under us gaap the evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to us gaap for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessments we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts we must perform a quantitative impairment test 

under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value of the respective reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit could be based on one or more of the following fair value measures amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties present value techniques of estimated future cash flows valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue or a similar performance measure 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity investment risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing funding and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 approximately 30 and 63 respectively of our total cash cash equivalents and investment portfolio excluding restricted cash and strategic investments was held in cash and cash equivalents the assets underlying the customer balances which we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits time deposits us and foreign government and agency securities corporate debt securities and assetbacked securities we seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in certain jurisdictions where we operate equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances we do not pay interest on amounts due to customers 

if interest rates increased by 100 basis points the fair value of our availableforsale debt securities investment portfolio would decrease by approximately 173 million and 68 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

we have 90 billion in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates since these notes bear interest at fixed rates they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change we also have a committed revolving credit facility of 50 billion available to us we are obligated to pay interest on borrowings under this facility as well as other customary fees including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating borrowings under this facility if any bear interest at floating rates as a result we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest rate to the extent of our borrowings as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility for additional information see “note 12—debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us or to lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for loans and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may adversely impact our financial results we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services our cash flows results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities we are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts please see “note 10—derivative instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 



we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings and our investment in a foreign subsidiary from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow and net investment hedges for accounting purposes the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings the accumulated gains and losses associated with the net investment hedge will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated at which point they will be reclassified into earnings 

we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 20 at december 31 2020 and 2019 the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 11 billion and 900 million lower respectively if the us dollar strengthened by 20 at december 31 2020 and 2019 the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 11 billion and 900 million higher respectively 

we have an additional foreign currency exchange management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts 

adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 353 million and 147 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively without considering the offsetting effect of foreign currency exchange contracts foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2020 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 369 million resulting in a net positive impact of approximately 16 million foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2019 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 153 million resulting in a net positive impact of approximately 6 million these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term 

equity investment risk 

our strategic investments are subject to a variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio as of december 31 2020 and 2019 our strategic investments totaled 32 billion and 18 billion respectively which represented approximately 17 and 13 of our total cash cash equivalents and investment portfolio at each of those respective dates our strategic investments include marketable equity securities which are publicly traded and nonmarketable equity securities which are investments in privately held companies that are not publicly traded we are required to record all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our consolidated statements of income as such we anticipate volatility to our net income in future periods due to changes in fair value related to our investments in marketable equity securities and changes in observable prices related to our nonmarketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative these changes could be material based on market conditions a hypothetical adverse change of 10 in the carrying value of our strategic investments which could be experienced in the near term would have resulted in a decrease of approximately 323 million to the carrying value of the portfolio as of december 31 2020 we review our nonmarketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent purchases and sales of securities and other publicly available data

we generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other paymentrelated services

we focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to democratize the management and movement of money we provide consumers with a digital wallet which enables them to send payments to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources which may include a bank account a paypal account balance a venmo account balance a paypal credit account a credit or debit card or other stored value products such as coupons gift cards and eligible credit card rewards

we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange optional instant transfers from their paypal or venmo account to their debit card or bank account and on interest and fees from our paypal credit product 

protecting merchants and consumers 

protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry and sustainably growing our business fraudulent activities such as account takeover identity theft including stolen financial information and counterparty malicious activities represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers as well as their payment partners we provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions completed on our payments platform excluding gatewayexclusive transactions or situations where our customer agreements specifically do not provide for protections we believe that these programs which protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss resulting from fraud and counterparty nonperformance are generally much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry as a result merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that the merchants would not incur if they used our payments services we also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for review up to 180 days posttransaction we believe that this protection is generally consistent with or better than that offered by other payments providers these programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers who will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item or service in the condition significantly as described and merchants who will receive payment for the product or service they deliver to the customer 

our ability to protect both merchants and consumers is based largely on our proprietary endtoend payments platform and our ability to leverage the data from both sides of transactions on our twosided network specifically from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments we believe mobile devices will continue to play a significant and increasing role in commerce including by creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer for example paypal uses data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce financial and fraud risk to merchants and consumers our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having paypal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands 

  

competition 

the global payments industry is highly competitive rapidly changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight we compete against a wide range of businesses including those that are larger than we are have greater name recognition longer operating histories or a dominant or more secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer as well as smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competition also may intensify as businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different aspects of our business 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following 

 

in addition to the discussion in this section see “item 1a risk factors” under the caption “ we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business 

research and development 

total research and development expense was 11 billion 11 billion and 953 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

intellectual property

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy cybersecurity and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation new or changing laws and regulations including how such laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate 

payments regulation various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the us and internationally in the us paypal inc holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent which among other things subjects paypal inc to reporting requirements bonding requirements limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state regulatory agencies outside the us we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries the activities of those nonus entities are or may be supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate among other regulatory authorities the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” the australian prudential regulation authority the monetary authority of singapore the reserve bank of india the central bank of russia the central bank of brazil and the peoples bank of china have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions this list is not exhaustive and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change 

banking agency supervision  we serve our customers in the european union “eu” through paypal europe sàrl et cie sca a whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg by the cssf consequently we must comply with rules and regulations of the european banking industry including those related to capitalization funds management corporate governance antimoney laundering disclosure reporting and inspection we are or may be subject to bankingrelated regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry in addition based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions we are or may be subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators 

consumer financial protection bureau  the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the us including consumer credit deposits payments and similar products as a large market participant of remittance transfers the cfpb has direct supervisory authority over our business the cfpb and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business 

antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing paypal is subject to antimoney laundering “aml” laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities our aml program is designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activities or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets controls “ofac” and equivalent authorities in other countries our aml and sanctions compliance programs overseen by our amlbank secrecy act officer is composed of policies procedures and internal controls and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks 

interchange fees interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions for example in the eu the multilateral interchange fee “mif” regulation caps interchange fees for credit and debit card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card transactions including paypal as a result the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge 

data protection and information security aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the us the eu asia pacific and elsewhere for example the eu adopted a comprehensive general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which came into effect in may 2018 gdpr expanded the scope of the eu data protection law to foreign companies processing personal data of european economic area “eea” individuals and imposed a stricter data protection compliance regime in the us we are subject to privacy and information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act and the california consumer privacy act that require similar privacy protections afforded by the gdpr as well as the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program in europe the operations of our luxembourg bank are subject to confidentiality and information safeguarding requirements under the luxembourg banking act regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux 

anticorruption paypal is subject to applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act and similar anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate anticorruption laws generally prohibit offering promising giving accepting or authorizing others to provide anything of value either directly or indirectly to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage such as to obtain or retain business we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations 

additional regulatory developments various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues including virtual currencies identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules cybersecurity and marketing that may impact paypal’s business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion is divided into three sections the first section which begins immediately following this paragraph discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the second section captioned “risks related to our separation from ebay” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation from ebay in july 2015 into an independent publicly traded company the third section captioned “risks related to our common stock” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our common stock you should carefully review all of these sections in addition to the other information appearing in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business   if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive rapidly changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight we compete against a wide range of businesses including those that are larger than we are have greater name recognition longer operating histories or a dominant or more secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer as well as smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competition also may intensify as businesses enter into business combinations and partnerships and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different aspects of our business 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following 



 

we compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments including 

 

we often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish grow or maintain these partner relationships 

we also face competition and potential competition from 

 

some of our current and potential competitors have larger customer bases broader geographic scope volume scale resources and market share than we do which may provide them significant competitive advantages some competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing and other regulatory requirements they may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of products and services and offer lower prices or more effectively offer their own innovative programs products and services 

if we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors drive value for our customers or effectively and efficiently align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively in the market 

substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as well as the trading price of our common stock 

substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter as a result our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including the risks set forth in this “risk factors” section it is difficult for us to forecast accurately the level or source of our revenues or earnings in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast expenses quarterly and annual expenses reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph 

global and regional economic conditions could harm our business 

our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to among other factors 

 

these and other global and regional economic events and conditions including brexit could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform in addition any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry significant failures of financial service institutions new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income credit currency and equity markets which could have a material adverse impact on our business see also the risk factor captioned “ the united kingdoms departure from the eu could adversely affect us ” 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services the use of our products and services and consequently our revenues could decline 

rapid significant and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate including developments in 

 

as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies these third parties may restrict or prevent our access to or utilization of those technologies as well as their platforms or products in addition we may not be able to accurately predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful in addition our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industrywide standards platform providers payments networks changes to laws and regulations the extent of changing expectations of consumers or merchants thirdparty intellectual property rights or other factors our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable to do so in a timely or costeffective manner our business could be harmed 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition 

our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of confidential information and customers’ personal data including financial information and information about how they interact with our payments platform we have built our reputation on the premise that our payments platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to systems and information including customers’ personal data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target unauthorized parties have attempted and we expect that they will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including but not limited to hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers partners or vendors and attempting to fraudulently induce users of our systems including employees and our customers into disclosing user names passwords payment card information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems threats can come from a variety of sources including criminal hackers hacktivists statesponsored intrusions industrial espionage and insider threats certain efforts may be supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks cyberextortion spear phishing and social engineering schemes the introduction of computer viruses or other malware and the physical destruction of all or portions of our information technology and infrastructure could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems we believe that paypal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect data we manage prevent data loss and other security breaches and effectively respond to known and potential risks and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections there can be no assurance that these security measures will provide absolute security or prevent breaches or attacks 

our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance insider threats system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities actual or perceived breaches of our security could among other things 



in addition any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting the information technology or infrastructure of companies we acquire or of our customers partners or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects see note 4—“business combinations ” note 5—“goodwill and intangible assets ” and note 13—“commitments and contingencies ” to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of tio networks “tio ”  which we acquired in july 2017 as part of an investigation of security vulnerabilities of the tio platform actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us 

in addition under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses we also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us and the eu have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs require us to change our business practices make it more difficult for new customers to join paypal and reduce the ease of use of our products which could harm our business while we maintain insurance policies they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 

systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites applications products or services could harm our business 

our systems and those of our service providers and partners have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions distributed denialofservice and other cyberattacks insider threats human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires and other natural disasters power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future disruptions in our systems due to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism some of our systems including systems of companies we have acquired are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcomes or events in addition as a provider of payments solutions we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans which may be costly and timeconsuming to implement and may divert our resources from other business priorities 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures denialofservice attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and services these events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue a prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability speed or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers or partners to believe that our systems are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services and could permanently harm our reputation and brands moreover if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims even if unsuccessful would likely be timeconsuming and costly for us to address and could have other consequences described in this “risk factors” section under the caption “ cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition ” 

our payments platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability the fulltime availability and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments we have undertaken and continue to undertake certain system upgrades and replatforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed these efforts are costly and timeconsuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fines and penalties and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business 

we also rely on facilities components applications and services supplied by third parties including data center facilities and cloud storage services which subjects us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “risk factors” section under the captions “ we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk ” from time to time such third parties have ceased to provide us with such facilities and services additionally if these third parties experience operational interference or disruptions breach their agreements with us fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations or experience a cybersecurity incident our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which could result in customer dissatisfaction regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation and brands and materially and adversely affect our business while we maintain business interruption insurance our coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events 

in addition we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies implementation of new systems and technologies is complex expensive and timeconsuming if we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended this could have an adverse impact on our business internal controls including internal controls over financial reporting results of operations and financial condition 

changes to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our business 

we rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for their services from time to time payment card networks have increased and may continue to increase in the future the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for transactions that access their networks payment card networks have imposed and may impose in the future special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a digital wallet such as paypal’s which could negatively impact us and significantly increase our costs our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing which could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income we have entered into strategic partnerships with visa mastercard and other credit card networks to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with their respective credit cards and debit cards during the terms of these agreements visa and mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules that solely target paypal upon termination of the agreements paypal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments 

in addition in some jurisdictions government regulations have required payment card networks to reduce or cap interchange fees any material change in credit card or debit card interchange rates in the us or other markets including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional payment card service providers and our business as well as the revenue we earn from our card programs 

we are required to comply with payment card network operating rules including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our merchants we may also be directly liable to the payment card networks for rule violations the payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules if such allegations are not resolved favorably they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly and adversely affect our business the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement as a result we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged if we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do so our business would be adversely affected 

we and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines we are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or considered “high risk” under their network operating rules including the sale of certain types of digital content for “high risk” merchants we must either prevent such merchants from using paypal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants although the amount of these fines has not been material to date we could be subject to significant additional fines in the future which could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers which would adversely affect our business payment card network rules may also increase the cost of impose restrictions on or otherwise negatively impact the development of our retail pointofsale solutions which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption 

failure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transactions bad transactions and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and could negatively impact our business and severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis in the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchants goods or services do not match the merchant’s description we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers we seek to recover such losses from the merchant but we may not fully recover them if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay in addition in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use eg airline cruise or concert tickets custommade goods and subscriptions we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payments while we have established allowances for transaction losses based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such losses incurred as of the reporting date these reserves may be insufficient 

we also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase fraud erroneous transactions and customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments in addition if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment which would negatively impact our business we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measures require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings if these measures do not succeed our business could be negatively impacted 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies including the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar which subject us to foreign currency exchange risk the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus these foreign currencies impacts the translation of our net revenues generated and expenses incurred in these foreign currencies into the us dollar in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set them we also hold a portion of our corporate and customer funds in nonus currencies and our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these nonus currencies into us dollars we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries while we regularly enter into transactions to hedge foreign currency exchange risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure it is impossible to predict or entirely eliminate the effects of this exposure 

any factors that reduce crossborder trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business 

crossborder trade ie transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries is an important source of our revenue and profits crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market crossborder trade also represents our primary and in some cases our only presence in certain important markets   

crossborder trade is subject to and may be negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in addition the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer are often extremely complicated in the context of crossborder trade and foreign exchange changes to or the interpretation andor application of laws and regulations applicable to crossborder trade and foreign exchange could impose additional requirements and restrictions increase costs and impose conflicting obligations any factors that increase the costs of crossborder trade for us or our customers or that restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical such as trade policy or higher tariffs could reduce our crossborder transactions and volume negatively impact our revenues and profits and harm our business see also the risk factor captioned “ global and regional economic conditions could harm our business” 

changes in how consumers fund their paypal transactions could harm our business 

we pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or from an existing paypal account balance or through our paypal branded consumer credit products our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using payment cards which can significantly increase our costs although we provide consumers in certain markets with the opportunity to use their existing paypal account balance to fund payment transactions some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards especially if these payment cards offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their paypal accounts an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lowercost funding options could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business 

we have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks andor issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit cards andor debit cards and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for instore point of sale paypal transactions these arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business while we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card which would likely increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix which could adversely affect our business results of operations and profitability 

the united kingdom’s departure from the eu could adversely affect us 

the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in june 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk formally exited the eu on january 31 2020 and a transition period is in place until december 31 2020 during which time the uk will remain in both the eu customs union and single market and follow eu rules there is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu after this date 

brexit could therefore adversely affect uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign currency exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro which in turn could adversely affect us or our customers and companies with which we do business particularly in the uk brexit could lead to greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the uk and the eea region with the potential inability of uk companies to fulfill orders which could lead to a risk of increased merchant defaults and buyer protection claims brexit could also trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions a downturn in consumer sentiment and overall negative economic growth any of these scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or our customers 

in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms as national laws and regulations in the uk start to diverge from eu laws and regulations in particular depending on the terms of brexit we may face new regulatory costs and challenges including the following 

 

these and other factors related to brexit could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight our failure to comply with extensive complex overlapping and frequently changing rules regulations and legal interpretations could materially harm our business 

our business is subject to laws rules regulations policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate including but not limited to those governing 

• banking 

• credit 

• deposit taking 

• crossborder and domestic money transmission 

• prepaid access 

• foreign currency exchange 

• privacy 

• data governance 

• data protection 

• cybersecurity 

• banking secrecy 

• fraud detection 

• payment services including payment processing and settlement services 

• consumer protection 

• antitrust and competition 

• economic and trade sanctions 

• antimoney laundering and 

• counterterrorist financing 

our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business 

as we expand and localize our international activities we have become increasingly obligated to comply with the laws of the markets in which we operate in addition because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws laws regulating the internet mobile and related technologies outside of the us often impose different more specific or even conflicting obligations on us as well as broader liability for example certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” or us antimoney laundering or counterterrorist financing regulations 

any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of any government authority including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws regulations or orders including those discussed in this risk factor may subject us to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions result in additional compliance and licensure requirements cause us to lose existing licenses or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operations and force us to change our business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned transactions product launches or improvements any of the foregoing could individually or in the aggregate harm our reputation damage our brands and business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the complexity of us federal and state and international regulatory and enforcement regimes coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in a single event prompting a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our employees contractors and agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

payments regulation 

in the us paypal inc has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in the states where such licenses are required as well as in the district of columbia the us virgin islands and puerto rico these licenses include not only the paypal branded products and services in these states but also our braintree venmo and xoom products and services we may also maintain such licenses for certain companies that we have acquired such as hyperwallet as a licensed money transmitter paypal is subject to among other requirements restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds reporting requirements bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies accordingly if we violate these laws or regulations we could be subject to liability andor additional restrictions forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states forced to change our business practices or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals which could impose substantial costs 

while we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets including the us to also receive payments in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can hold balances or withdraw funds these limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets 

we principally provide our services to customers in the eu through paypal europe our whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in luxembourg accordingly paypal europe is potentially subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization corporate governance privacy data protection data governance information security banking secrecy taxation risk management sanctions or other requirements imposed on luxembourg credit institutions in addition eu laws and regulations are subject to potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the eu which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage moreover the countries that are eu members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing european directives which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage the revised payment services directive “psd2” took effect in europe in 2018 with certain requirements becoming applicable from 2019 or later psd2 enables new payment and information sharing models whereby regulated payment providers are able to access bank and payment accounts including paypal accounts for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer such access could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of competitors in the european payments market psd2 also imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication “sca” that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a paypal transaction which may adversely impact paypal’s european customer value proposition sca was implemented in 2019 in line with an opinion issued by the european banking authority “eba” national competent authorities including luxembourg have announced enforcement deferral periods for migration to sca requirements for ecommerce cardbased transactions paypal europe has implemented sca customer processes covering the majority of payment transactions initiated within the eu and has plans to finalize full compliance with sca amending or accelerating these plans may adversely impact paypal’s european customer value proposition 

if the business activities of paypal europe exceed certain thresholds or if the european central bank “ecb” so determines paypal europe may be deemed a significant supervised entity such that some activity of paypal europe could become directly regulated by the ecb rather than the cssf the luxembourg regulator  as its national supervisor which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs 

in many of the other markets outside the us in which we do business we serve our customers through paypal pte ltd our whollyowned subsidiary based in singapore paypal pte ltd is supervised by the monetary authority of singapore and designated as a holder of a stored value facility but does not hold a remittance license as a result paypal pte ltd is not able to offer outbound remittance payments from singapore and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in singapore in many of the markets other than singapore served by paypal pte ltd it is unclear and uncertain whether our singaporebased service is subject only to singapore law or if it is subject to the application of local laws whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service bank financial institution or otherwise the payment services act “ps act” passed into law in singapore in january 2019 and is expected to come into effect in 2020 under the ps act paypal pte ltd will be required to apply for a license to continue to provide payments services in singapore furthermore once the ps act comes into force and is fully implemented we may face new regulatory costs and challenges including the following 

 

in certain markets outside the us eg australia we provide our services to customers through a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight which may be the holder of a local payment license certification or other authorization in such markets we may be subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if we violate applicable reporting antimoney laundering capital requirements privacy corporate governance risk management or any other applicable requirements 

paypal australia pty limited “ppau” selfreported a potential violation to the australian transaction reports and analysis centre “austrac” on may 22 2019 with respect to the reporting of international funds transfer instructions under the antimoney laundering and counterterrorism financing act 2006 “amlctf act” please see note 13—commitments and contingencies—litigation and regulatory matters—for additional disclosure regarding this matter 

from time to time we may acquire entities subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight for example in december 2019 we completed our acquisition of a 70 equity stake in guofubao information technology co gopay ltd “gopay” a provider of online payment services in china gopay holds a number of payment business licenses in china and is subject to regulatory supervision by the people’s bank of china and other regulatory bodies we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the jurisdictions where we provide our services including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will be able to or decide to obtain any such licenses certifications and approvals in addition there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining and renewing such licenses certifications and approvals and we could be subject to fines other enforcement action and litigation if we are found to violate disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses these factors could impose substantial additional costs involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market 

in many countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider bank financial institution or otherwise in such markets we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign currency exchange transactions in local currency local regulators may use their authority to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services require significant and costly operational changes impose restrictions limitations or additional requirements on our business or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market 

consumer protection 

we are subject to consumer protection antitrust and competitionrelated laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate in the us we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities including the electronic fund transfer act “efta” and regulation e as implemented by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” these regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services follow specified error resolution procedures and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer additionally technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to 1000 in individual cases or up to 500000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases we are subject to and have paid amounts in settlement of lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the efta and regulation e or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices eg that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts 

the cfpb issued a final rule on prepaid accounts that came into effect on april 1 2019 the rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple unaffiliated merchants at atms andor for p2p transfers that definition includes certain digital wallets the rule’s requirements include among other things the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account the extension of regulation e liability limits and errorresolution requirements to all prepaid accounts the application of regulation z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the cfpb and their publication to the general public we have implemented certain changes to comply with the final rule and made substantial changes to the design of certain us consumer accounts and their operability which could lead to unintended customer confusion and dissatisfaction discourage customers from opening new accounts require us to reallocate resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business in december 2019 we filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the cfpb challenging the validity of the prepaid account rule as applied to paypal inc as with any litigation there is no guarantee that our claims will succeed 

in may 2015 we entered into a stipulated final judgment and consent order “consent order” with the cfpb in which we settled regulatory claims arising from paypal credit practices between 2011 and 2015 the consent order included obligations of paypal to pay 15 million in redress to consumers and a 10 million civil monetary penalty and required paypal to make various changes to paypal credit disclosures and related business practices we continue to cooperate and engage with the cfpb and work to ensure compliance with the consent order which may result in us incurring additional costs 

paypal principally offers its services in eea countries through a “passport” notification process through the luxembourg regulator in the case of paypal europe or the swedish regulator in the case of izettle ab to regulators in other eea member states in accordance with eu regulations regulators in these countries could notify us of local consumer protection laws that apply to our business in addition to luxembourg or swedish consumer protection laws and could also seek to persuade the local regulator to order paypal to conduct its activities in the local country directly or through a branch office similarly as a result of brexit the uk regulators may impose new or different legal requirements on our uk business or require our activities to be conducted locally in the uk through a branch office or directly these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of or delay our plans to expand our business in eea countries 

economic and trade sanctions 

we are required to comply with economic and trade sanctions administered by the us the eu relevant eu member states and other jurisdictions in which we operate we have selfreported to ofac certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of us economic and trade sanctions in march 2015 we reached a settlement with ofac regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013 prior to the implementation of our realtime transaction scanning program subsequently we have selfreported additional transactions as possible violations and we have received new subpoenas from ofac seeking additional information about certain of these transactions such selfreported transactions could result in claims or actions against us including litigation injunctions damage awards fines or penalties or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss require significant management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business 

antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing 

we are subject to various antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit among other things our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities regulators in the us and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions many countries in which we operate also have antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response such changes could have the effect of making compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage lead to increased friction for customers and result in a decrease in business regulators regularly reexamine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance noncompliance with antimoney laundering laws may subject us to significant fines penalties lawsuits and enforcement actions result in regulatory sanctions and additional compliance requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operations or damage our reputation and brands in the eu for example penalties for noncompliance with antimoney laundering laws could include fines of up to 10 of paypal europe’s total annual turnover 

privacy and protection of user data 

we are subject to a number of laws rules directives and regulations which we refer to as “privacy and data protection laws” relating to the collection use retention security processing and transfer which we collectively refer to as “processing” of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees which we refer to as “personal data” in the countries where we operate our business relies on the processing of personal data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders as a result much of the personal data that we process which may include certain financial information associated with individuals is regulated by multiple privacy and data protection laws and in some cases the privacy and data protection laws of multiple jurisdictions in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between or among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relationships 

regulatory scrutiny of privacy data protection cybersecurity practices and the processing of personal data is increasing around the world there is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing artificial intelligence and blockchain technology any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws of any government authority including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws including those discussed in this risk factor may subject us to significant fines penalties civil lawsuits and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions result in additional compliance requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operations and force us to change our business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies as communicated to users in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities government entities or others including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions such proceedings or actions could subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity which may materially harm our business the foregoing may require us to change our business practices and would likely increase the costs and complexity of compliance in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy and data protection laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers 

paypal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of eea individuals to the us including reliance on binding corporate rules “bcrs” for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and standard contractual clauses “sccs” as approved by the european commission for transfers to and from third parties paypal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of paypal’s eea customers andor employees outside of the eea have compliant transfer mechanisms in october 2015 the european court of justice invalidated useu safe harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon by some paypal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of eu citizens to us companies and paypal entered into sccs with those third parties which had previously relied on the useu safe harbor framework in july 2016 the us and eu authorities agreed on a replacement for the safe harbor framework known as “privacy shield” both the privacy shield framework and sccs continue to face legal challenges in the european justice system to the extent that the privacy shield or sccs are invalidated paypal’s ability to process eea personal data with third parties outside of the eea and intragroup with its us affiliates could be jeopardized 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents receivables outstanding and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the us and abroad as part of our currency hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities we regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk despite these efforts we may be exposed to the risk of default by or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of these counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default deterioration or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited held in accounts with or otherwise due from such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

paypal is not a bank or licensed lender in the us and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business which raises additional risks 

as paypal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state in the us we rely on thirdparty chartered financial institutions to provide paypal branded credit products to our customers in the us including consumer credit products such as paypal credit paypal branded credit cards and merchant credit products such as paypal working capital and paypal business loan products any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend could interrupt or limit our ability to offer consumer credit and merchant credit products which could materially and adversely affect our business in the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend we may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another charter financial institution on favorable terms or at all obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly timeconsuming and uncertain process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements which could significantly increase our costs and compliance obligations and require us to change our business practices which could materially and adversely affect our business in addition as a service provider to these bank partners which are federally supervised us financial institutions we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators 

in july 2018 we completed the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank as a part of a separate agreement paypal earns a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by synchrony bank which includes both the sold and newly generated receivables and we do not hold an ownership interest in newly generated consumer credit receivables it may take us longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results in addition our increased reliance on and credit exposure to synchrony bank including in connection with this agreement subjects us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “risk factors” section under the captions “ we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk ” and “ if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses ” 

our ability to receive the benefit of our business finance offerings may be subject to challenge 

merchant loans and advances under our paypal working capital and paypal business loan products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us we acquire the receivables generated by those loans after origination 

a case decided in the us court of appeals for the second circuit madden v midland funding llc  786 f3d 246 2d cir 2015 resulted in uncertainty as to whether nonbank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans the decision which specifically addressed preemption under the national bank act could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions including fdicinsured state chartered industrial banks like the issuing bank of loans and advances under paypal working capital and paypal business loan products there continue to be a number of us state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a nonbank entity enters into a relationship with a thirdparty chartered financial institution for the issuance of credit products while we believe the manner in which paypal branded credit products are offered can be distinguished from madden  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation and an adverse determination could materially impact our paypal working capital and paypal business loan products and our business 

some of our credit products expose us to additional risks 

we offer our paypal credit consumer product and our paypal working capital and paypal business loan products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in various markets and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk the credit decisionmaking process for the paypal credit consumer product uses proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on among other factors their past purchasing and payment history with paypal as well as their credit scores similarly proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who desire to use our business finance offerings to help predict their ability to repay these risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant market conditions economic environment or limited transaction history or other data among other factors the accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements competitors’ actions changes in consumer behavior changes in the economic environment and other factors our international expansion of our credit product offerings expose us to additional risks including those discussed in the risk factor captioned “ our international operations subject us to increased risks which could harm our business ” 

like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from merchant credit we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations creating the risk of potential chargeoffs we face similar risks with respect to us consumer credit losses through the profitsharing arrangement with synchrony bank the nonpayment rate among account holders may increase due to among other factors changes to underwriting standards risk models not accurately predicting the creditworthiness of a consumer worsening economic conditions such as a recession or government austerity programs increases in prevailing interest rates and high unemployment rates account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans 

we currently purchase receivables related to the paypal branded merchant credit products in the us if we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a costeffective manner or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes our business could be harmed 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business 

war terrorism political events geopolitical instability trade barriers and restrictions public health issues natural disasters or other catastrophic events have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global regional or countryspecific basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business our customers and companies with which we do business such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers geopolitical trends including nationalism protectionism and restrictive visa requirements could limit the expansion of our business in those regions our corporate headquarters are located in the silicon valley which is a seismically active region in california our business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters fire power shortages earthquakes floods nuclear power plant accidents and events beyond our control such as other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes and public health issues a catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate 

our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions and protect consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description in addition consumers who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer usually a bank which in turn will seek recovery from us the risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers sellers and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements or changes that we decide to implement such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs increases in our loss rate including as a result of changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could negatively impact our business 

our international operations subject us to increased risks which could harm our business 

our international operations have generated approximately onehalf of our net revenues in recent years there are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic ie incountry and crossborder basis including but not limited to 

 

violations of the complex foreign and us laws rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion may increase our costs of doing business internationally and could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets including assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts a low or negative interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our net income in addition fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for loan and interest receivables which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

we have entered into a fiveyear revolving credit facility and a 364day revolving credit facility as well as other committed and uncommitted credit facilities around the world we have borrowed under our credit facilities from time to time and any borrowings under these credit facilities that bear interest at a floating rate would expose us to interest rate fluctuations 

use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business 

our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses including money laundering terrorist financing illegal online gambling fraudulent sales of goods or services illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances piracy of software movies music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods in particular digital goods bank fraud child pornography human trafficking prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products securities fraud pyramid or ponzi schemes or the facilitation of other illegal activity the use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses has subjected us and may subject us in the future to claims individual and class action lawsuits and government and regulatory investigations inquiries or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us moreover certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction and a merchant may be found responsible for intentionally or inadvertently importing or exporting illegal goods resulting in liability for us changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and government authorities may consider additional paymentsrelated proposals from time to time owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions including paypal that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm and any resulting liabilities loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business 

our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business 

we hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services or recipients of p2p transactions in certain jurisdictions where we operate we are required to hold eligible liquid assets as defined by the relevant regulator in such jurisdiction equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances our ability to manage and accurately account for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls as our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls paypal europe with the permission of the cssf utilizes certain european customer balances held by our luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to certain customers our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines and additional restrictions which could materially harm our business 

we are subject to regulatory activity and legal proceedings under antitrust and competition laws 

we are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies regarding antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the us and internationally including in connection with proposed business combinations acquisitions and investments some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us individual states other countries or the eu or otherwise constitute unfair competition some regulators and legislators particularly those outside of the us may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive any claims or investigations even if without merit may be very expensive to defend or respond to involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in reputational harm significant judgments fines or remedial actions against us or require us to change our business practices make product or operational changes or delay or preclude planned transactions product launches or improvements 

we are subject to patent litigation 

we have been sued repeatedly for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents at any given time we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits we expect that we will continue to be subject to patent infringement claims because among other reasons 

 

such claims may be brought directly against us or against our users whom we may indemnify due to contractual obligations or as a business matter we believe that many of the claims against us and other technology companies have been and continue to be initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims we vigorously defend against patent infringement claims in addition we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries patent claims whether meritorious or not could be timeconsuming divert management’s resources be costly to manage defend and resolve and lead to attempts by other parties to pursue similar claims additionally patent claims could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings or cease conducting certain operations which would harm our business 

we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business 

effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights 

although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business 

as the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others the ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and regardless of the outcome any such claim with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business and require us to among other things redesign or stop providing our products or services pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters may harm or restrict our business 

we are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory actions and government inquiries 

we are regularly subject to claims individual and class action lawsuits government and regulatory investigations inquiries actions or requests and other proceedings alleging violations of laws rules and regulations with respect to competition antitrust intellectual property privacy data protection information security antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing sanctions anticorruption consumer protection fraud accessibility securities tax labor and employment commercial disputes services charitable fundraising contract disputes escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property the matters described in note 13—“commitments and contingencies—litigation and regulatory matters—general matters” to our consolidated financial statements and other matters in particular our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation as discussed above the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries may increase as our business expands in scale scope and geographic reach and our products and services increase in scale and complexity in addition the laws rules and regulations affecting our business including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce data protection payments services and credit are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and government authorities and the resulting uncertainty in their scope and application increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and government actions alleging violations 

the scope outcome and impact of claims lawsuits government investigations disputes and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such matters can have an adverse impact which may be material on our business results of operations or financial condition because of legal costs diversion of management resources reputational damage and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex factintensive process that involves a high degree of judgment resolving one or more of such legal and regulatory proceedings or other matters could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services require us to change our business practices in costly ways or develop noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

while certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions including the class action waiver provisions in the future or in any given case legislative administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of predispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits including additional consumer class action litigation and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation 

changes in us tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow results of operations and financial conditions 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” the tax act made changes to the corporate tax rate businessrelated deductions and taxation of foreign earnings among others that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 throughout 2018 and 2019 the us treasury and certain states issued proposed and final legislation and clarifying guidance with respect to the various provisions of the tax act additional legislation and guidance is expected to be issued in 2020 and could have a material adverse impact on the value of our us deferred tax assets result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods and increase our future us tax expense the implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign authorities and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by authorities throughout the world any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient 

in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of losses in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign currency exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items 

various levels of government such as us federal and state legislatures and international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” and the eu are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue various countries most notably in the eu have proposed or enacted digital services taxes any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate 

we and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and recordkeeping obligations 

a number of us states the us federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or recordkeeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance additionally a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes we have modified our systems to meet applicable requirements and expect that further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and recordkeeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions and harm our business 

acquisitions joint ventures strategic investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business 

acquisitions joint ventures strategic investments and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses technologies services products and other assets as well as joint ventures strategic investments and commercial and strategic partnerships these transactions may involve significant challenges uncertainties and risks including 



 

at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more strategic transactions any of which could individually or in the aggregate be material to our financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of these transactions and those benefits and synergies may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results because acquisitions are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition any acquisitions dispositions or investments may also require us to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt and increased interest expense recognize liabilities and record gains or losses realized or unrealized and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or writeoffs of goodwill or intangibles which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness as applicable 

joint ventures and strategic investments in which we have a minority ownership stake inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control joint ventures or companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand 

there are risks associated with our indebtedness 

we have incurred indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences including without limitation the following 

 

our revolving credit facilities and the indenture for our senior unsecured notes pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict among other things our business and operations if we fail to pay amounts due under a debt instrument or breach any of its covenants the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder subject in certain cases to a grace or cure period moreover any such acceleration and required repayment of or default in respect of our indebtedness could in turn constitute an event of default under other debt instruments thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of our indebtedness any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase in addition any downgrades to our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and the terms of any such financing any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business including the following 



 

because we rely on third parties to provide certain of our services and to facilitate certain of our business activities we face increased operational risk these third parties may be subject to financial legal regulatory and labor issues cybersecurity incidents privacy breaches service terminations disruptions or interruptions or other problems which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf which could harm our business in addition these third parties may breach their agreements with us disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all fail or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately take actions that degrade the functionality of our services impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers or give preferential treatment to competitive services there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers on our behalf will continue to do so on acceptable terms or at all if any third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or our customers on our behalf we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all and we may be subject to business disruptions losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies customer dissatisfaction reputational damage legal or regulatory proceedings or other adverse consequences which could harm our business 

our point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks 

we have several point of sale solutions which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to or otherwise communicating with a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale we have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing credit and debit cards via paypal at the point of sale those agreements provide us with access to each of these partners tokenization services in the us for instore pointofsale paypal transactions which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process we believe that the addition of the izettle point of sale solutions to our product portfolio will enable us to further expand our instore presence as we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the point of sale we will face additional risks including 



unless we are able to successfully manage these risks including driving adoption of and significant volume through our point of sale solutions over time our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on key personnel because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of key personnel could harm our ability to maintain and grow our business 

our future success and performance are significantly dependent upon the continued services of key personnel including our executive team and other highly skilled employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate such personnel competition for key personnel is intense especially in the san francisco bay area where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high and we may be unable to successfully attract integrate or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel in making employment decisions particularly in the technology and payments industries job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment and our stock price volatility or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies may make it more difficult to attract retain and motivate employees we may be limited in our ability to recruit or hire internationally including due to restrictive laws or policies on immigration travel or availability of visas for skilled workers in addition we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract or retain highly qualified key personnel effectively could harm our business and growth prospects 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services 

companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them including claims alleging defamation libel harassment hate speech breach of contract invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services among other things the laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges we are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customerprovided content on our products and services particularly in jurisdictions outside the us where the applicable laws are unsettled if we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings which could harm our business 

risks related to our separation from ebay 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” ebay paypal and ebay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

on july 17 2015 we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by ebay inc of 100 of our outstanding common stock to ebay’s stockholders which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution” ebay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code the opinion was based on and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of ebay and of us including those relating to the past and future conduct of ebay and of us if any of these representations statements or undertakings were or became inaccurate or incomplete or if ebay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding the opinion of counsel the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that the distribution together with certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if the irs determines that any of these representations assumptions or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or any court and there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion the irs did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is taxfree 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code in general ebay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the paypal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value ebay stockholders who received paypal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities 

there are risks associated with our relationship with ebay 

in connection with our separation from ebay we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with ebay as well as various other agreements including an operating agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a data sharing addendum and a product development agreement the separation agreement the tax matters agreement the employee matters agreement and the intellectual property matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities including by means of licensing between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations the operating agreement the data sharing addendum and the product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between ebay and us related to payment processing credit and data sharing if either we or ebay are unable to satisfy our performance payment or indemnification obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to ebay 

disputes between ebay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future an adverse outcome in any such matters could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition ebay and paypal are currently involved in a dispute regarding the calculation and amount of referral services fees due to ebay under the operating agreement the parties are currently in arbitration proceedings with respect to this dispute pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions in the separation and distribution agreement 

our relationship with ebay is governed in part by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years expiring july 2020 and a oneyear tail period this operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with ebay as well as certain obligations and restrictions that limit paypal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of ebay as specified in the operating agreement while ebay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income we expect the portion of our revenue and operating income attributable to ebay to continue to decline due to various factors many of which are beyond our control including the expiration or earlier termination of the operating agreement with ebay and the speed and extent to which ebay intermediates payments on its platform including by acting as a merchant of record and migrating ebay merchants to ebays managed payments platform limits the availability of paypal as a payment option or offers or promotes alternative payment options directs transactions on its platforms to different providers of payment services or eliminates or modifies its risk management or customer protection programs on its platforms which could result in customer dissatisfaction reduction in ebay volume and other consequences adverse to our business if we are unable to generate sufficient business from our nonebay customers to offset the expected reduction in the portion of our business attributable to ebay it could materially impact the growth in our business and our ability to meet our longterm financial targets 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including but not limited to 



 

as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock in addition the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in addition in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits the filing of a lawsuit against us regardless of the outcome could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines the state courts of the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers alternatively if a court outside of delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 

we have also elected not to be governed by section 203 of the dgcl which provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation however contains a provision that generally mirrors section 203 of the dgcl except that it provides for a 20 threshold instead of the 15 provided for by the dgcl these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor 

while these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers they will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

business environment 

we are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide paypal is committed to democratizing financial services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy our goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world anytime on any platform and using any device we also facilitate persontoperson “p2p” payments through our paypal venmo and xoom products our combined payment solutions including our paypal paypal credit braintree venmo xoom and izettle products comprise our proprietary payments platform 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on important issues such as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy cybersecurity and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation new or changing laws and regulations including the way laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have significantly increased in recent years we are not immune to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future for additional information regarding our information security risks see “item 1a risk factors— cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition ” 

the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in june 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk formally exited the eu on january 31 2020 and a transition period is in place until december 31 2020 during which time the uk will remain in both the eu customs union and single market and follow eu rules there is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu after that date we are currently unable to determine the impact that brexit will have on our business as any impact will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations for additional information on how brexit could affect our business see “item 1a risk factors— the united kingdom’s departure from the eu could adversely affect us ” 

brexit could adversely affect uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign currency exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro we have foreign currency exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements 

in 2019  2018  and 2017  net revenues generated from our uk operations constituted 11 of total net revenues in 2019  2018  and 2017  net revenues generated from the eu excluding the uk constituted less than 20 of total net revenues approximately 37 and 31 of our gross loans and interest receivables as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively were generated from our uk operations approximately 6 and 7 of our gross loans and interest receivables as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively were generated from the eu excluding the uk 

overview of results of operations 

the following table provides a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017  



all amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million except as otherwise noted as a result certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided 

 not meaningful 

net revenues increased 23 billion  or 15  in 2019 as compared to 2018  driven primarily by growth in tpv as defined below under “net revenues” of 23  net revenues from our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate in 2019  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest and fee income due to the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank “synchrony” in july 2018 which resulted in a negative impact of approximately four percentage points to the net revenues growth rate in 2019  

total operating expenses increased 18 billion  or 14  in 2019 as compared to 2018  due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and to a lesser extent technology and development customer support and operations and general and administrative expenses partially offset by a decline in restructuring and other charges operating expenses related to our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate in total operating expenses in 2019  

operating income increased 525 million  or 24  in 2019 as compared to 2018  acquisitions completed in 2018 had a negative impact of approximately five percentage points to the 2019 growth rate in operating income our operating margin was 15 and 14 in 2019 and 2018  respectively operating margin in 2019 was positively impacted by a reduction in restructuring and other charges driven primarily by the completion of the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio in july 2018 subsequent to which we no longer record adjustments to the cost basis of loans and interest receivables held for sale offset by a negative impact of growth in our transaction expense which increased 22 in 2019  compared to a 15 increase in net revenues in the same period acquisitions completed in 2018 had a negative impact of approximately one percentage point in our operating margin for the year ended december 31 2019  

net income increased by 402 million  or 20  in 2019 as compared to 2018  due to an increase in operating income of 525 million and an increase in other income expense net of 97 million  driven primarily by net unrealized gains on strategic investments partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of 220 million  

impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

we have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar in 2019  2018  and 2017  we generated approximately 47  46  and 46 of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the united states respectively because we generate substantial net revenues internationally we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the us as discussed under “item 1a risk factors— risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition ” 

we calculate the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings 

in the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  the yearoveryear foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar had the following impact on our reported results 

while we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure 

we also use a foreign currency exchange contract designated as a net investment hedge to reduce the foreign currency risk related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary gains and losses associated with this instrument will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated 

additionally in connection with our services that are paid for in multiple currencies we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities 

financial results 

net revenues 

our revenues are classified into the following two categories 

 

 

our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following 

  

 

net revenues analysis 

the components of our net revenue for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 were as follows 



transaction revenues 

transaction revenues increased by 24 billion  or 17  in 2019 compared to 2018  due primarily to growth in tpv mainly from our paypal braintree and venmo products and growth in the number of payment transactions both of which resulted primarily from an increase in our active accounts fees charged to facilitate instant transfer of funds for our customers contributed approximately two percentage points and acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate of transaction revenues in 2019  net gains from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2019 were 238 million  compared to net losses of 23 million in 2018  refer to “note 10—derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program 

the following table provides a summary of our active accounts number of payment transactions tpv and related metrics 



all amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million except as otherwise noted as a result certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided 

1 reflects active accounts as of the end of the applicable period an active account is an account registered directly with paypal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our payments platform not including gatewayexclusive transactions within the past 12 months a platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to paypal’s payments platform through such third party’s login credentials 

2 number of payment transactions are the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

3 number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period divided by active accounts at the end of the period 

4 tpv is the value of payments net of reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

 not meaningful 

transaction revenues grew more slowly than both tpv and the number of payment transactions in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a higher proportion of p2p transactions primarily from our venmo and paypal products from which we earn lower fees and a lower proportion of cross border transactions partially offset by foreign currency exchange hedging gains changes in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2019

net revenues from other value added services decreased by 69 million  or 4  in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower interest and fee income earned on our consumer loans receivable driven by the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio in july 2018 the decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue share with synchrony discussed below an increase in interest and fee income earned on our merchant loans and advances receivable and an increase in interest earned resulting from growth in customer balances other value added services revenues included approximately 113 million and 109 million for the year ended december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 respectively due to revenue earned from transition servicing activities provided to synchrony which ended in the second quarter of 2019 acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately four percentage points to the growth rate of other value added services revenues in 2019  

the total gross consumer and merchant loans receivable balance including loans and receivable held for sale as of december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 was 42 billion  27 billion  and 78 billion respectively the yearoveryear increase of 56 in 2019 compared to 2018  was driven by an increase in both our merchant loans and international consumer loan portfolios the yearoveryear decrease of 66 in 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by the completion of the sale of us consumer credit receivables portfolio 

in november 2017 we reached an agreement to sell our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony to free up balance sheet capacity and cash flow for other uses and mitigate balance sheet risk following the closing of this transaction in july 2018 synchrony became the exclusive issuer of the paypal credit online consumer financing program in the us and we no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program subsequent to the sale we earn a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by synchrony which is recorded in net revenues from other value added services 

operating expenses 

beginning with the first quarter of 2019 we reclassified certain operating expenses within our consolidated statements of income prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to this presentation these changes have no impact on our previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods including total operating expenses financial position or cash flows for any periods presented for additional information see “note 1—overview and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts 

the following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trends in each 



1 prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the classification changes discussed above 

2 transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by tpv 

3 transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by tpv 

transaction expense 

transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment these costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction we refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix” the cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a paypal account balance a venmo account balance or paypal credit as we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers our funding mix may change which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate the cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the us than in the us our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix regional mix funding mix and assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding sources 

transaction expense increased by 12 billion  or 22  in 2019 compared to 2018  primarily attributable to an increase in tpv of 23  acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate of transaction expense in 2019 the decrease in transaction expense rate in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to changes in product mix for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  approximately 2 of tpv was funded with paypal credit for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  approximately 41  43  and 43 of tpv respectively was generated outside of the us 

transaction and loan losses 

transaction losses include the expense associated with our buyer and seller protection programs fraud and chargebacks loan losses include the losses associated with our merchant and consumer loans receivable portfolio except loans and interest receivable held for sale our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors including tpv macroeconomic conditions changes to our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants 

the components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017 were as follows 



1 transaction loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction losses by tpv 

transaction and loan losses increased by 106 million  or 8  in 2019 compared to 2018  

transaction losses increased by 33 million  or 3  in 2019 compared to 2018  due to growth in tpv partially offset by benefits realized through improvements in risk management capabilities which also contributed to a decrease in our transaction loss rate over the same period 

loan losses increased by 73 million  or 34  in 2019 compared to 2018  due primarily to growth in our merchant loans and advances and international consumer loans receivable balances partially offset by the recognition of losses in 2018 associated with us consumer credit receivable balances that were not subject to the sale agreement with synchrony acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate of loan losses for 2019  

the consumer loans receivable balance as of december 31 2019 and 2018 was 13 billion and 704 million  respectively the yearoveryear increase of 88 in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to growth in international markets approximately 94 and 93 of our consumer loans receivables outstanding as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively were due from consumers in the uk 

the following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance 



1 represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer 

2 net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year 

we offer business financing solutions to certain small and mediumsized merchants total merchant loans advances and interest and fees receivable outstanding net of participation interest sold as of december 31 2019 and 2018 were 28 billion and 19 billion  respectively the yearoveryear increase of 50 in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to growth in our paypal business loan portfolio and an increase in the availability of our paypal working capital product approximately 83 and 10 of our merchant receivables outstanding as of december 31 2019 were due from merchants in the us and uk as compared to 87 and 10 as of december 31 2018  respectively 

the following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans advances and interest and fees receivable balance 



1 excludes 30 million of loan receivables related to izettle merchant receivables 

modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our paypal credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loans and interest receivables for additional information see “note 11—loans and interest receivable” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and “item 1a risk factors— some of our credit products expose us to additional risks ” included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

customer support and operations 

customer support and operations includes a costs incurred in our global customer operations centers including costs to provide call support to our customers b costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers and c other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products including payment devices card production and customer onboarding and compliance costs 

customer support and operations costs increased 208 million  or 15  in 2019 compared to 2018  the increase in 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in employeerelated expenses in our operations function that support the growth of our active accounts and payment transactions and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the applications that we use to support our customers and underlying data in our operations centers our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate of customer support and operations costs in 2019  

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing includes costs incurred for customer acquisition business development advertising and marketing programs 

sales and marketing expenses increased 87 million  or 7  in 2019 compared to 2018  due primarily to increases in employeerelated expenses amortization of acquired intangibles and consulting services partially offset by lower spend on marketing programs our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately eight percentage points to the growth rate of sales and marketing expenses in 2019  primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles 

technology and development 

technology and development includes a costs incurred in connection with the development of our payments platform new products and the improvement of our existing products including the amortization of software and website development costs incurred in developing our payments platform which are capitalized and acquired developed technology and b our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our payments platform 

technology and development expenses increased 254 million  or 14  in 2019 compared to 2018  due primarily to increase s in employeerelated expenses and to a lesser extent in data center and cloud computing services utilized in delivering our products and amortization of acquired intangibles partially offset by a decline in costs related to contractors and consultants our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately four percentage points to the growth rate of technology and development expenses in 2019  

general and administrative 

general and administrative includes costs incurred to provide support to our business including legal human resources finance risk compliance executive and other support operations 

general and administrative expenses increased 170 million  or 11  in 2019 compared to 2018  due primarily to increases in employeerelated expenses and to a lesser extent in facilities costs and depreciation and amortization associated with systems and tools used in our general and administrative functions these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional service expenses including those related to acquisition related transaction expenses incurred in 2018  our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately four percentage points to the growth rate of general and administrative expenses in 2019  

restructuring and other charges 

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of restructuring expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables held for sale portfolio restructuring and other charges decreased by 238 million in 2019 compared to 2018  due primarily to the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio in july 2018 prior to which adjustments to the cost basis of loans and interest receivables held for sale were recorded within restructuring and other charges this decline was partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges of 53 million in 2019 as compared to 2018 additionally in 2019  we recorded a gain of 7 million representing an adjustment to the loss from additional expenses incurred associated with the sale of our us consumer credit portfolio to synchrony 

in the first quarter of 2019 and 2018 management approved strategic reductions of the existing global workforce which resulted in restructuring charges of 78 million and 25 million  respectively the approved strategic reductions for 2019 were intended to better align our teams to support key business priorities and also included the transfer of certain operational functions between geographies as well as the impact of the transition of servicing activities provided to synchrony which terminated in the second quarter of 2019 the estimated annual employeerelated costs associated with the impacted workforce is approximately 175 million the majority of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce was reinvested in the business the strategic reduction approved in the first quarter of 2018 included restructuring charges related to the decision to wind down tio’s operations we incurred primarily employee and severance benefits expenses under both the 2019 and 2018 strategic reductions which were substantially completed by the end of 2019 and 2018 respectively 

other income expense net 

other income expense net increased 97 million  or 53  in 2019 compared to 2018  primarily driven by net unrealized gains on strategic investments due to favorable changes in fair value related to our marketable equity securities and the positive impact of observable price changes related to our nonmarketable equity securities which collectively contributed to incremental net gains of 121 million year over year this increase was partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the long term debt issued in the third quarter of 2019 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate was 18 in 2019 and 13 in 2018  the increase in our effective tax rate in 2019 was primarily the result of taxes associated with the intragroup transfer of intellectual property related to the acquisition of izettle see “note 16—income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information on our effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

we require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations including customer protection programs our credit products capital expenditures investments in our business potential acquisitions and strategic investments working capital and other cash needs the following table summarizes our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2019 and 2018 



1 excludes assets related to funds receivable and customer accounts of 225 billion and 201 billion as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

2 excludes total restricted cash of 64 million and 77 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively and strategic investments of 18 billion and 293 million as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively 

foreign cash cash equivalents and investments 

cash cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were 72 billion as of december 31 2019 and 87 billion as of december 31 2018  or 61 and 89 of our total cash cash equivalents and investments as of those respective dates at december 31 2019  all of our cash cash equivalents and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to us taxation under subpart f global intangible low taxed income “gilti” or the onetime transition tax as further discussed in “note 16—income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k subsequent repatriations to the us will not be taxable from a us federal tax perspective but may be subject to state or foreign withholding tax a significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers’ requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our businesses but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries as such not all of our cash is available for general corporate purposes 

available credit and debt 

on september 26 2019 we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of 50 billion collectively referred to as the “notes” proceeds from the issuance of these notes may be used for general corporate purposes which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt share repurchases ongoing operations capital expenditures and possible acquisitions of businesses assets or strategic investments 

on september 11 2019 we entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” that provides for an unsecured 50 billion  fiveyear revolving credit facility that includes a 150 million letter of credit subfacility and a 500 million swingline subfacility with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time additionally on september 11 2019 we entered into a 364day credit agreement “364day credit agreement” that provides for an unsecured 10 billion 364day revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement and the 364day credit agreement and as such 60 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the credit agreement and the 364day credit agreement subject to customary conditions to borrowing upon our entry into the credit agreement the credit agreement that we entered into in the third quarter of 2015 providing for an unsecured 20 billion  fiveyear revolving credit facility was terminated 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we entered into an amended credit agreement “amended credit agreement” which amended and restated in its entirety the previous agreement entered into in 2017 the amended credit agreement provided for an unsecured 50 billion  364day delayeddraw term loan credit facility which was available in up to four separate borrowings until april 6 2019 as of december 31 2018  20 billion was outstanding under the amended credit agreement on april 5 2019 the company drew down an additional 500 million under the amended credit agreement on september 26 2019 the amended credit agreement was terminated and we repaid 25 billion of borrowings outstanding under that agreement 

we also maintain committed and uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with borrowing capacity of approximately 230 million in the aggregate this available credit a portion of which is guaranteed by paypal includes facilities where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes capital expenditures and acquisitions 

interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings as of december 31 2019  substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available subject to customary conditions to borrowing 

for additional information see “note 12—debt” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we have cash pooling arrangements with a financial institution for cash management purposes each arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution “aggregate cash deposits” each arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreedupon limit the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under each arrangement as of december 31 2019  we had a total of 35 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our 35 billion in aggregate cash deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangements 

liquidity for credit portfolio growth 

growth in the portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business we continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding for our credit portfolio in june 2018 the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” agreed that paypal’s management may designate up to 35 of european customer balances held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used for european and us credit activities during the year ended december 31 2019  an additional amount of 500 million was designated by management to fund such credit activities as of december 31 2019  the cumulative amount approved by management to be designated for credit activities aggregated to 20 billion and represented approximately 31 of european customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the cssf we may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances if necessary based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal under certain exceptional circumstances corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our european customer balances 

credit ratings 

as of december 31 2019  we continue to be rated investment grade by standard and poor’s financial services llc and fitch ratings inc we expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance including our capital structure and results of operations our goal is to be rated investment grade but as circumstances change there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading if that were to occur it could increase our borrowing rates including the interest rate on loans under our credit agreements 

risk of loss 

the risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers merchants and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations in and changes or modifications to the programs including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report our transaction loss rates ranged between 015 and 018 of tpv historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results 

stock repurchases and acquisitions 

during the year ended december 31 2019  we repurchased approximately 14 billion of our common stock including approximately 656 million in the open market and approximately 750 million pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase agreement under our stock repurchase program authorized in april 2017 as of december 31 2019  a total of approximately 68 million and 10 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our april 2017 and july 2018 stock repurchase programs respectively for additional information see “note 14—stock repurchase programs” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

in january 2020 we completed our acquisition of honey science corporation “honey” for approximately 36 billion in cash and approximately 400 million in restricted stock subject to vesting conditions we believe our acquisition of honey will enhance our value proposition by allowing us to further simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers while driving conversion and increasing consumer engagement and sales for merchants 

other considerations 

our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating our financial performance and global credit market conditions as well as a broad range of other factors in addition our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see “item 1a risk factors— risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition ” and “note 13—commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and investments cash expected to be generated from operations and our expected access to capital markets together with potential external funding through third party sources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities anticipated capital expenditures and our credit products for the foreseeable future depending on market conditions we may from time to time issue debt including in private or public offerings to fund our operating activities finance acquisitions make strategic investments repurchase shares under our share repurchase programs or reduce our cost of capital 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain noncash expenses timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred and changes in other assets and liabilities significant noncash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation the cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as a negative impact to changes in other assets and liabilities in cash from operating activities the expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our consumer and merchant credit products excluding the us consumer credit portfolio from and after november 2017 actual chargeoffs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit products excluding the us consumer credit portfolio from and after november 2017 have no impact on cash from operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 46 billion in 2019 due primarily to operating income of 27 billion  during 2019 adjustments for noncash expenses of stockbased compensation were 10 billion  depreciation and amortization were 912 million  and provision for transaction and loan losses were 14 billion  partially offset by adjustments related to deferred income taxes of 269 million and net unrealized gains on our strategic investments of 207 million in 2019 the cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by the changes in other assets and liabilities of 433 million  primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period partially offset by an increase in funds payable and amounts due to customers and an increase in accounts receivable of 120 million  

we generated cash from operating activities of 55 billion in 2018 due primarily to operating income of approximately 22 billion and the positive impact of 14 billion of changes in loans and interest receivable held for sale net following the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio adjustments for noncash expenses of stockbased compensation were 853 million and depreciation and amortization were 776 million during 2018  adjustments for noncash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately 13 billion and cost basis adjustments to loans and interest receivable held for sale were 244 million during 2018  the cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in other assets and liabilities of 708 million  primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period 

cash paid for income taxes net in 2019  2018  and 2017 was 665 million  328 million  and 117 million  respectively 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities includes purchases maturities and sales of investments cash paid for acquisitions and strategic investments purchases and sales of property and equipment changes in principal loans receivable and funds receivable 

the net cash used in investing activities of 57 billion in 2019 was due primarily to purchases of investments of 279 billion  changes in principal loans receivable net of 16 billion  purchases of property and equipment of 704 million  and changes in funds receivable from customers of 342 million  these cash outflows were partially offset by maturities and sales of investments of 249 billion  

we generated cash from investing activities of 840 million in 2018 due primarily to maturities and sales of investments of 219 billion  changes in principal loans receivable net of 31 billion  and changes in funds receivable from customers of 11 billion  these cash inflows were offset by purchases of investments of 224 billion  acquisitions of 21 billion net of cash and restricted cash acquired and purchases of property and equipment of 823 million  

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock purchases of treasury stock tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards borrowings and repayments under financing arrangements and funds payable and amounts due to customers 

we generated cash from financing activities of 37 billion in 2019 due primarily to 55 billion of cash proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in the form of fixed rate notes as well as borrowings under our amended credit agreement and changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 25 billion  these cash inflows were partially offset by repayment of borrowings under our amended credit agreement of 25 billion  the repurchase of 14 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of 504 million  

the net cash used in financing activities of 13 billion in 2018 was due primarily to the repurchase of 35 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs repayments of borrowing under financing arrangements of 11 billion  and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of 419 million  partially offset by cash inflows from borrowings under financing arrangements of 21 billion and changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 16 billion  

effect of exchange rates on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 

foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash during 2019 and 2018 of 6 million and 113 million  respectively the negative impact in 2018 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the australian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

future liquidity and obligations 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 31 billion of unused credit was available to paypal credit account holders compared to 18 billion of unused credit as of december 31 2018  while this amount represents the total unused credit available we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all our paypal credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time in addition the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination based on among other things account usage and customer creditworthiness 

we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes changes in our business needs contractual cancellation provisions fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2019 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations 



the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows 

 

 

 

 

as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits net the table above does not include 990 million of such noncurrent liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2019  

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues no individual quarter in 2019  2018  or 2017 accounted for more than 30 of annual net revenue 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in “note 1 — overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates require regular review and adjustment 

transaction and loan losses 

transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud chargebacks and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors including total tpv macroeconomic conditions changes to our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products which include our paypal credit consumer product and merchant loans and advances arising from our paypal working capital “ppwc” and paypal business loan “ppbl” products 

we establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchantrelated chargebacks due to nondelivery of goods or services ach returns buyer protection program claims account takeovers and account overdrafts additions to the allowance in the form of provisions are reflected in transaction and loan losses on our consolidated statements of income the allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances internal factors including experience with similar cases historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 

we also establish an allowance for loans receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our merchant loans and advances and consumer loans receivable increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses on our consolidated financial statements this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments for our consumer loan receivables consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates “roll rates” roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our consumer loan receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to 180 days past the payment due date to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off for merchant loans and advances the allowance is primarily based on principal balances forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintagebased loss forecasting model 

the allowance for loss against the interest receivable is determined primarily by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off the allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintagebased loss forecasting model increases to the allowance for interest receivable are reflected as a reduction of net revenues on our consolidated statements of income increases to the allowance for fees receivable are recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date based on our results for the year ended december 31 2019  an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately 138 million

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax laws and regulations our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the us through new provisions under the tax act such as the gilti tax and base erosion antiabuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors including our historical experience and shortrange and longrange business forecasts to the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized we record a valuation allowance 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with us gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return us gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest and penalties where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

based on our results for the year ended december 31 2019  a onepercentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately 30 million  

loss contingencies 

we are currently involved in various claims regulatory and legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims litigation or other violations and may revise our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 

revenue recognition 

application of the accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized and goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets our estimates are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 

we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist under us gaap the evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the us gaap for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessments we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts we must perform a quantitative impairment test 

under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value of the respective reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties present value techniques of estimated future cash flows valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue or a similar performance measure 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity investment risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing funding and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018 approximately 63 and 78  respectively of our total cash cash equivalents and investment portfolio excluding restricted cash and strategic investments was held in cash and cash equivalents the assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits time deposits us and foreign government and agency securities and corporate debt securities we seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in certain jurisdictions where we operate equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances we do not pay interest on amounts due to customers 

we have 50 billion in fixed rate debt with varying maturity dates since these notes bear interest at fixed rates they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates however the fair value of these notes fluctuates when interest rates change we also have various committed credit facilities available to us aggregating to approximately 61 billion we are obligated to pay interest on loans under these facilities as well as other customary fees including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating borrowings under these facilities if any bear interest at floating rates as a result we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuations in interest rate to the extent of our borrowings as of december 31 2019  we had no amounts outstanding under these credit facilities as of december 31 2018  we had 20 billion of borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 334  for additional information see “note 12—debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us or to lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for loans and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities at december 31 2019 and 2018  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may adversely impact our financial results we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services our cash flows results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities we are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts please see “note 10—derivative instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings and our investment in a foreign subsidiary from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow and net investment hedges for accounting purposes the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings the accumulated gains and losses associated with the net investment hedge will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated at which point they will be reclassified into earnings 

we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 20 at december 31 2019 and 2018  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 900 million and 707 million lower respectively if the us dollar strengthened by 20 at december 31 2019 and 2018  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 900 million and 707 million higher respectively 

we have an additional foreign currency exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts 

adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 147 million and 295 million at december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively without considering the offsetting effect of hedging foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2019 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 153 million  resulting in a net positive impact of approximately 6 million  foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2018 would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 308 million  resulting in a net positive impact of approximately 13 million  these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term 

equity investment risk 

our strategic investments are subject to a variety of marketrelated risks that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio as of december 31 2019 and 2018  our strategic investments totaled 18 billion and 293 million  respectively which represented approximately 13 and 3 of our total cash cash equivalents and investment portfolio at those respective dates our strategic investments include marketable equity securities which are publicly traded and nonmarketable equity securities which are investments in privately held companies that are not publicly traded we are required to record all adjustments to the carrying value of these strategic investments through our consolidated statements of income as such we anticipate volatility to our net income in future periods due to changes in fair value related to our investments in marketable equity securities and changes in observable prices related to our nonmarketable equity securities accounted for under the measurement alternative these changes could be material based on market conditions a hypothetical adverse change in the carrying value of our strategic investments of 10 which could be experienced in the near term would result in a decrease of approximately 184 million to the carrying value of the portfolio we review our nonmarketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent purchases and sales of securities and other publicly available data

key performance metrics 

we measure the relevance of our products and services to our customers and therefore the success of our business through active accounts payment transactions and payment volume 

active accounts  an active account is an account registered directly with paypal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our payments platform not including gatewayexclusive transactions within the past 12 months a platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to paypals payments platform through such third partys login credentials as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 267 million  active accounts across more than 200  markets a market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction such as a country territory or protectorate in which we offer some or all of our services a country territory or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations 

number of payment transactions    number of payment transactions is the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

total payment volume “tpv”  tpv is the value of payments net of reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

our strengths 

our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors we believe that our competitive strengths include the following

the technology infrastructure supporting our payments platform simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitates the deployment and operation of largescale global products and services our technology infrastructure is designed around industrystandard architectures intended to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences our payments platform incorporates multiple layers of protection for continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help address cybersecurity challenges we have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect our technology infrastructure and payments platform against these challenges including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities we strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and payments platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency scalability and security 

merchant and consumer payment solutions 

our combined payment solution capabilities offer our merchants and consumers a broad range of products and services enabling our merchants to securely and simply receive payments from their customers while allowing our consumers to make seamless transactions across different markets and networks 

we partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by improving sales conversion providing global reach offering alternative payment methods reducing losses through proprietary protection programs providing fraud prevention and risk management solutions and leveraging data analytics we generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other paymentrelated services merchants can onboard quickly with paypal and are generally not required to invest in new or specialized hardware we do not charge merchants setup or recurring fees for our standard service we offer access to credit products for certain small and mediumsized merchants through our paypal working capital and paypal business loan products which we collectively refer to as our business financing offerings our paypal working capital product allows businesses to borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume processed by paypal for a fixed fee our paypal business loan product provides businesses with shortterm financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner we believe that our business financing offerings allow us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and mediumsized business merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available effectively or efficiently from traditional banks or other lending providers 

paypal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices we believe our braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers and service providers that offer their services primarily through mobile applications through a single braintree integration a merchant can begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards paypal paypal credit google pay apple pay samsung pay and other payment solutions we also offer gateway services including our payflow gateway services and braintree gateway services which enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards our gateway services provide the payment gateway technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and enable merchants to accept payments online with credit and debit cards 

we believe that our recent acquisition of izettle in september 2018 will enable us to further expand our instore presence and strengthen our payments platform to help small businesses around the world grow and thrive in an omnichannel retail environment izettle offers a card acceptance service that enables small businesses to take credit and debit card payments as well as a software solution to record manage and analyze sales izettle provides instore capabilities in eleven countries as well as nearterm instore expansion opportunities into other existing paypal markets 

we focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to democratize the management and movement of money we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange and on interest and fees from our paypal credit product we offer our paypal credit product to consumers as a potential funding source at checkout once a consumer is approved for credit paypal credit is made available as a funding source in his or her account we believe that our consumer credit products allow us to increase engagement with consumers and merchants on our twosided network and differentiate ourselves from other payment processors by helping merchants drive incremental sales through products like paypal credit we are responsible for servicing functions related to all of our credit products in the us credit originating from our paypal working capital and paypal business loan products is currently extended through thirdparty financial institutions from whom we purchase the related receivables for our consumer and merchant credit products outside the us we extend credit through certain international paypal subsidiaries 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we expanded our strategic consumer credit relationship with synchrony financial and agreed to sell our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank following the closing of this transaction in july 2018 synchrony bank became the exclusive issuer of the us paypal branded consumer credit program and we no longer hold an ownership interest in receivables generated through the program 

we offer consumers persontoperson “p2p” payment solutions through our paypal venmo and xoom products paypal continues to be a key driver of our total p2p volumes enabling both domestic and international p2p transfers across our payments platform our venmo app in the us is a leading mobile application used to move money between our customers and to make purchases at approved merchants xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money to pay bills for and send prepaid mobile phone reloads to people around the world in a secure fast and costeffective way using a mobile device or personal computer p2p is a significant customer acquisition channel that facilitates organic growth by enabling potential paypal users to establish active accounts with us at the time they make or receive a p2p payment 

protecting merchants and consumers 

protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and fraud loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry and sustainably growing our business fraudulent activities such as account takeover identity theft and counterparty malicious activities represent a significant risk to merchants and consumers as well as their payment partners we provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions completed on our payments platform excluding gatewayexclusive transactions or situations where our customer agreements specifically do not provide for protections we believe that these programs which protect both merchants and consumers from financial and fraud loss due primarily to fraud and counterparty nonperformance are generally much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry as a result merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that the merchants would not incur if they used our payments services we also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for review up to 180 days posttransaction we believe that this protection is generally consistent with or better than that offered by other payments providers these programs are designed to promote confidence on both the part of consumers ie when using our payment platform they will only be required to pay if they receive their purchased item or service in the condition significantly as described and merchants ie they will receive payment for the product they deliver to the customer 

our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our proprietary endtoend payments platform and our ability to leverage the data from both sides of transactions on our twosided network ie from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments we believe mobile devices will continue to play a significant and increasing role in commerce including by creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer for example paypal is able to use location data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce financial and fraud risk to merchants and consumers our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having paypal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands 

  

competition 

the global payments industry is highly competitive rapidly changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight we compete against a wide range of businesses including those that are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer as well as smaller companies that may be able to respond more quickly in the face of regulatory and technological changes we compete against all forms of payments including credit and debit cards automated clearing house and bank transfers other online payment services mobile payments and offline payment methods including cash and check 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following 

 

in addition to the discussion in this section see “item 1a risk factors” under the caption “ we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business 

research and development 

total research and development expense was 11 billion  953 million  and 834 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

intellectual property 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks particularly those covering the paypal name patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services we have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control use access to and limit disclosure of our proprietary information 

we pursue the registration of our domain names trademarks and service marks in the us and internationally additionally we have filed patent applications in the us and in international jurisdictions covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology and new innovations we have registered our core brands as domain names and as trademarks in the us and a large number of other jurisdictions we also have in place an active program to continue to secure and enforce trademarks and domain names that corresponds to our brands in markets of interest 

for additional information regarding some of the risks relating to our intellectual property including costs of protecting our intellectual property see the information in “item 1a risk factors” under the captions “ we are subject to patent litigation ” and “ we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights ” 

government regulation 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy cybersecurity and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation new or changing laws and regulations including how such laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate 

payments regulation  various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the us and internationally in the us paypal inc holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent which among other things subjects paypal inc to reporting requirements bonding requirements limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state regulatory agencies outside the us we provide similar services customized for various countries and foreign jurisdictions through our foreign subsidiaries the activities of those nonus entities are or may be supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate among other regulatory authorities the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” the australian securities and investment commission the monetary authority of singapore the reserve bank of india and the central bank of russia have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in their respective jurisdictions this list is not exhaustive and there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change 

banking agency supervision  we serve our customers in the european union “eu” through paypal europe sàrl et cie sca a whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg by the cssf consequently we must comply with rules and regulations of the european banking industry including those related to capitalization funds management corporate governance antimoney laundering disclosure reporting and inspection we also are or may be subject to bankingrelated regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry in addition based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions we are or may be subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators 

consumer financial protection bureau  the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the us including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products as a large market participant of remittance transfers the cfpb has direct supervisory authority over our business the cfpb and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business 

antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing  paypal is subject to antimoney laundering “aml” laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities our aml program is designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activities or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets controls “ofac” and equivalent authorities in other countries our aml and sanctions compliance programs overseen by our amlbank secrecy act officer is composed of policies procedures and internal controls and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks 

interchange fees  interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions for example in the eu the multilateral interchange fee “mif” regulation caps credit and debit interchange fees for card payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card transactions including paypal as a result the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge 

data protection and information security  aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the us the eu asia pacific and elsewhere for example the eu adopted a comprehensive general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which came into effect in may 2018 as supplemented by any national laws such as in the uk the data protection act 2018 and further implemented through binding guidance from the european data protection boardand expanded the scope of the eu data protection law to foreign companies processing personal data of european economic area “eea” individuals imposed a stricter data protection compliance regime and included new data subject rights eg the right to erasure commonly known as the “right to be forgotten” in the us we are subject to privacy information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act that require the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program and in europe the operations of our luxembourg bank are subject to confidentiality and information safeguarding requirements under the luxembourg banking act among other laws regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations than exist today in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux 

anticorruption paypal is subject to applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act and similar anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate anticorruption laws generally prohibit offering promising giving accepting or authorizing others to provide anything of value either directly or indirectly to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage such as to obtain or retain business we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations 

additional regulatory developments  various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues including virtual currencies identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules cybersecurity and marketing that may impact paypals business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion is divided into three sections the first section which begins immediately following this paragraph discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the second section captioned “risks related to our separation from ebay” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation from ebay in july 2015 into an independent publicly traded company the third section captioned “risks related to our common stock” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our common stock you should carefully review all of these sections in addition to the other information appearing in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business   if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry 

the global payments industry is highly competitive rapidly changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny we compete against a wide range of businesses including businesses that are larger than we are have a more dominant and secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer as well as smaller companies that may be able to respond more quickly to regulatory and technological changes many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competition may also intensify as businesses enter into business combinations and alliances and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with different aspects of our business 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following 

   

we compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments including 

 

we often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish grow or maintain these partner relationships 

we also face competition and potential competition from 

 

some of these competitors have larger customer bases volume scale resources and market share than we do which may provide them significant competitive advantages some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing and other regulatory requirements they may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of products and services and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs products and services that adversely impact our growth 

if we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors drive value for our customers or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively in the market 

substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as well as the trading price of our common stock 

substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter as a result our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including as a result of the risks set forth in this “risk factors” section it is difficult for us to forecast accurately the level or source of our revenues or earnings in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph 

global and regional economic conditions could harm our business 

our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to among other factors 

 

these and other global and regional economic events and conditions including brexit could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform in addition any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry significant financial service institution failures new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income credit currency and equity markets which could have a material adverse impact on our business see also the risk factor captioned “the united kingdoms departure from the eu could adversely affect us” 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services the use of our products and services and consequently our revenues could decline 

rapid significant and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate including developments in payment card tokenization cryptocurrencies mobile social commerce ie ecommerce through social networks authentication virtual currencies including distributed ledger and blockchain technologies and nfc and other proximity payment technology such as contactless payments as a result we expect new services and technologies to continue to emerge and evolve and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new or evolving technologies these   third parties may restrict or prevent our access to or utilization of those technologies as well as their platforms or products in addition we may not be able to accurately predict which technological developments or innovations will become widely adopted and how those technologies may be regulated we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful in addition our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industrywide standards payments networks changes to laws and regulations resistance to change from consumers or merchants thirdparty intellectual property rights or other factors our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable to do so in a timely or costeffective manner our business could be harmed 

cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition 

our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data including financial information and information about how they interact with our payments platform in addition a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment cards or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us we have built our reputation on the premise that our payments platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments an increasing number of organizations including large merchants businesses technology companies and financial institutions as well as government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites mobile applications and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to our systems our data or customers data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and have become increasingly complex and sophisticated may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized or detected until after they have been launched against a target we expect that unauthorized parties will continue to attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers partners or vendors or attempting to fraudulently induce for example through spear phishing attacks our employees customers partners vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names passwords payment card information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems certain efforts may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats including advanced and persisting cyberattacks phishing and social engineering schemes could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data in our systems we believe that paypal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections there can be no assurance that these security measures provide absolute security 

our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breaches of our security measures due to human error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities actual or perceived breaches of our security could among other things 

 

in addition any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers partners or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects see note 4—“business combinations ”  note 5—“goodwill and intangible assets ”  and note 13—“commitments and contingencies ”  to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of tio networks “tio ”  which we acquired in july 2017 as part of an investigation of security vulnerability of the tio platform actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us 

in addition under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing vendors we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses we also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us and the eu have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs require us to change our business practices make it more difficult for new customers to join paypal and reduce the ease of use of our products which could harm our business while we maintain insurance policies they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 

systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites applications products or services could harm our business 

our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions distributed denialofservice and other cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires and other natural disasters power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future disruptions in our systems due to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition as a provider of payments solutions we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans which may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures denialofservice attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and services these events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue a prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability speed or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services and could permanently harm our reputation and brands moreover if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims even if unsuccessful would likely be timeconsuming and costly for us to address and could have other consequences described in this “risk factors” section under the caption “ cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business results of operation and financial condition ” 

our payments platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability the fulltime availability and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments we have undertaken certain system upgrades and replatforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed these efforts are costly and timeconsuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fines and penalties and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business 

we also rely on facilities components and services supplied by third parties including data center facilities and cloud storage services if these third parties cease to provide the facilities or services experience operational interference or disruptions breach their agreements with us fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations or experience a cybersecurity incident our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and brands and materially and adversely affect our business we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events 

in addition we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies implementation of new systems and technologies is complex expensive and timeconsuming if we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended this could have an adverse impact on our business internal controls including internal controls over financial reporting results of operations and financial condition 

changes to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our business 

we rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for their services from time to time payment card networks have increased and may continue to increase in the future the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks payment card networks have imposed and may impose in the future special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as paypal’s which could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing which could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income we have entered into strategic partnerships with visa and mastercard and other credit card networks to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with their respective credit and debit cards during the terms of these agreements visa and mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules that solely target paypal upon termination of the agreements paypal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments 

in addition in some jurisdictions governmental regulations have required payment card networks to reduce interchange fees any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the us or other markets including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers and our business 

we are required to comply with payment card network operating rules including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants we may also be directly liable to the payment card networks for rule violations the payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules and have alleged from time to time that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules if such allegations are not resolved favorably they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement as a result we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged if we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do so our business would be adversely affected 

we and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines we are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk” including the sale of certain types of digital content for “high risk” merchants we must either prevent such merchants from using paypal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants although the amount of these fines has not been material to date additional fines in the future could become significant and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers which would adversely affect our business payment card network rules may also increase the cost of impose restrictions on or otherwise negatively impact the development of our retail pointofsale solutions which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption 

failure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transactions bad transactions and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services 

our operations process a significant volume and dollar value of transactions on a daily basis in the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchants goods or services do not match the merchant’s description we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers we seek to recover such losses from the merchant but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay in addition in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use eg airline cruise or concert tickets custommade goods and subscriptions we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment while we have established allowances for transaction losses based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such losses incurred as of the reporting date these reserves may be insufficient 

we also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase from customer fraud from erroneous transactions and as a result of customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments in addition if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment which would harm our business we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against fraud particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings if these measures do not succeed our business could be harmed 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our financial results 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies including the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar which subject us to foreign currency risk the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in nonus currencies our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these nonus currencies into us dollars we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries while we regularly enter into transactions to hedge foreign currency risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure 

any factors that reduce crossborder trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business 

crossborder trade ie transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries is an important source of our revenue and profits crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market crossborder trade also represents our primary and in some cases our only presence in certain important markets 

crossborder trade is subject to and may be negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations in addition the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer are often extremely complicated in the context of crossborder trade changes to or the interpretation andor application of laws and regulations applicable to crossborder trade could impose additional requirements and restrictions impose conflicting obligations and increase the costs associated with crossborder trade any factors that increase the costs of crossborder trade for us or our customers or that restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical such as trade policy or higher tariffs could negatively impact our revenues and profits and harm our business see also the risk factor captioned “ global and regional economic conditions could harm our business”   

changes in how consumers fund their paypal transactions could harm our business 

we pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or from an existing paypal account balance or through our paypal branded consumer credit products our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards collectively “payment cards” which can significantly increase our costs although we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing paypal account balance to fund payment transactions some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards especially if these payment cards offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their paypal accounts an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions with lowercost funding options could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business 

we have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks andor issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit andor debt cards and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for instore point of sale paypal transactions these arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business while we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card which would likely increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix which could adversely affect our business results of operations and profitability 

the united kingdom’s departure from the eu could adversely affect us 

the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in june 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government initiated the exit process under article 50 of the treaty on european union which commenced a twoyear period expiring on march 29 2019 after which time the uk is expected to leave the eu in the absence of any effective extension to the article 50 period political negotiations are underway however there is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the uks exit from the eu and the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu the uks financial service regulators are implementing temporary permission regimes that are expected to be put in place by the uks government to support european economic area “eea” financial services firms in continuing to conduct business in the uk should the uk exit the eu without an agreement 

brexit could adversely affect uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro which in turn could adversely affect us or our customers and companies with which we do business particularly in the uk brexit could lead to greater restrictions on the supply and availability of goods and services between the uk and the eea region with the potential inability of uk companies to fulfill orders leading in turn to a risk of increased merchant defaults and buyer protection claims brexit could also trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions a downturn in consumer sentiment and overall negative economic growth any of these scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or our customers 

in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity for financial services firms as national laws and regulations in the uk start to diverge from eu laws and regulations in particular depending on the terms of brexit we may face new regulatory costs and challenges including the following 



 

these and other factors related to brexit could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight our failure to comply with extensive complex overlapping and frequently changing rules regulations and legal interpretations could materially harm our business 

our business is subject to laws rules regulations policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate including but not limited to those governing 

 

our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and enforcement and more restrictive rules and regulations that apply to our business 

as we expand and localize our international activities we have become increasingly obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate in addition because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws laws regulating the internet mobile and related technologies outside of the us often impose different more specific or even conflicting obligations on us as well as broader liability for example certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” or us antimoney laundering or counterterrorist financing regulations 

any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of any governmental authority including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws regulations or orders including those discussed in this risk factor may subject us to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions result in additional compliance and licensure requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operations and force us to change our business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements any of the foregoing could individually or in the aggregate harm our reputation damage our brands and business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the complexity of us federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

payments regulation 

in the us paypal inc has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in the states where such licenses are required as well as in the district of columbia the us virgin islands and puerto rico these licenses include not only the paypal branded products and services in these states but also our braintree venmo and xoom products and services we may also maintain such licenses for certain companies that we have recently acquired such as hyperwallet as a licensed money transmitter paypal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds reporting requirements bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies accordingly if we violate these laws or regulations we could be subject to liability andor additional restrictions forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states forced to change our business practices or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals which could impose substantial costs 

while we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets including the us to also receive payments in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds these limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets 

we principally provide our services to customers in the eu through paypal europe sarl et cie sca “paypal europe” our whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in luxembourg accordingly paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization fund management corporate governance privacy data protection information security banking secrecy taxation sanctions or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks in addition eu laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the eu which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage moreover the countries that are eu members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing european directives including the eu payment services directive and the emoney directive which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage the revised payment services directive “psd2” entered into force in january 2016 and is in the process of being implemented into national legislation with certain requirements effective january 13 2018 however a number of eu member states have not yet fully implemented psd2 into domestic legislation luxembourg which is the home member state of paypal europe implemented psd2 on july 28 2018 the implementation of psd2 may negatively affect our business psd2 seeks to enable new payment models whereby a newly formed category of regulated payment provider would be able to access bank and payment accounts including paypal accounts for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer such access could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of competitors in the european payments market psd2 seeks to regulate more online platforms that handle payments for their sellers paypal merchants with affected business models which are not licensed or which do not benefit from exemptions or integrate a compliant marketplaces solution may not be able to offer paypal products in the future psd2 also imposes new standards coming into force on september 14 2019 for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a paypal transaction which may adversely impact paypal’s customer value proposition and its european business 

if the business activities of paypal europe exceed certain thresholds or if the european central bank “ecb” so determines paypal europe may be deemed a significant supervised entity such that some activity of paypal europe could become directly regulated by the ecb rather than the luxembourg regulator the “cssf” as its national supervisor which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs 

in many of the other markets outside the us in which we do business we serve our customers through paypal pte ltd our whollyowned subsidiary based in singapore paypal pte ltd is supervised by the monetary authority of singapore and designated as a holder of a stored value facility but does not hold a remittance license as a result paypal pte ltd is not able to offer outbound remittance payments including donations to charities from singapore and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in singapore in many of the markets other than singapore served by paypal pte ltd it is unclear and uncertain whether our singaporebased service is subject only to singapore law or if it is subject to the application of local laws whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service bank financial institution or otherwise payment services legislation currently pending in singapore may change how paypal pte ltd is regulated and if such legislation is passed our compliance and operating costs will likely increase 

in certain markets outside the us eg australia we provide our services to customers through a local subsidiary subject to local regulatory supervision or oversight which may be the holder of a local payment license certification or other authorization in such markets we may be subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if we violate applicable reporting antimoney laundering capital requirements privacy corporation governance risk management or any other applicable requirements 

we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the jurisdictions where we provide our services including due to changes in applicable laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will be able to or decide to obtain any such licenses certifications and approvals in addition there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining and renewing such licenses certifications and approvals and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses these factors could impose substantial additional costs involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market 

in many countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider bank financial institution or otherwise in such markets we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit or impede us from doing business in a jurisdiction such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services require significant and costly operational changes impose restrictions limitations or additional requirements on our business or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market 

consumer protection 

we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate in the us we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities including the electronic fund transfer act “efta” and regulation e as implemented by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” these regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services follow specified error resolution procedures and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer among other requirements additionally technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to 1000 in individual cases or up to 500000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases we are subject to and have paid amounts in settlement of lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the efta and regulation e or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices eg that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts 

in october 2016 the cfpb issued a final rule on prepaid accounts the rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple unaffiliated merchants at atms andor for persontoperson transfers including certain digital wallets the rule’s requirements include the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account the extension of regulation e liability limits and errorresolution requirements to all prepaid accounts the application of regulation z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the cfpb and their publication to the general public in april 2017 the cfpb delayed the effective date of the final rule on prepaid accounts to april 1 2018 and indicated that it would review among other issues the linking of credit cards to digital wallets that are capable of storing funds in june 2017 the cfpb released proposed changes to its final rule and in january 2018 the cfpb issued its final rule modifying some aspects of the rule with an overall effective date of april 1 2019 we are in the process of implementing certain changes to comply with the final rule we expect that such implementation will require us to make substantial changes to the design of certain us consumer accounts and their operability which could lead to customer dissatisfaction require us to reallocate resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business 

in may 2015 we entered into a stipulated final judgment and consent order “consent order” with the cfpb in which we settled regulatory claims arising from paypal credit practices between 2011 and 2015 the consent order included obligations on paypal to pay 15 million in redress to consumers and a 10 million civil monetary penalty and required paypal to make various changes to paypal credit disclosures and related business practices we continue to cooperate and engage with the cfpb and work to ensure compliance with the consent order which may result in us incurring additional costs 

paypal europe principally offers its services in eu countries through a “passport” notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other eu member states pursuant to eu regulations regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its or the paypal groups activities in the local country directly or through a branch office these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of or delay our plans to expand our business in eu countries 

economic and trade sanctions 

we are required to comply with us economic and trade sanctions administered by ofac and the council of the european union respectively we have selfreported to ofac certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of us economic and trade sanctions in march 2015 we reached a settlement with ofac regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013 prior to the implementation of our realtime transaction scanning program subsequently we have selfreported additional transactions as possible violations and we have received new subpoenas from ofac seeking additional information about certain of these transactions such selfreported transactions could result in claims or actions against us including litigation injunctions damage awards fines or penalties or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss require significant management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business 

antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing 

we are subject to various antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit among other things our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities regulators in the us and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions many countries in which we operate also have antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response regulators regularly reexamine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance in the eu the implementation of the fourth antimoney laundering directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds commonly known as the revised wire transfer regulation may make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage lead to increased friction for customers and result in a decrease in business penalties for noncompliance with the fourth antimoney laundering directive could include fines of up to 10 of paypal europe’s total annual turnover on april 19 2018 the european parliament adopted the european commission’s proposal for a fifth antimoney laundering directive containing more stringent provisions in certain areas which may also increase compliance costs 

privacy and protection of user data 

we are subject to a number of laws rules directives and regulations which we refer to as “privacy laws” relating to the collection use retention security processing and transfer which we refer to as “process” of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees which we refer to as “personal data” in the countries where we operate our business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data across national borders as a result much of the personal data that we process especially financial information is regulated by multiple privacy laws and in some cases the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between or among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relationships 

regulatory scrutiny of privacy data protection and the collection storage use and sharing of personal data is increasing around the world there is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing and blockchain technology 

any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies and communicated to users prior to our collection use storage and transfer and disclosure of their personal data with applicable industry data protection or security standards with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders or with privacy data protection information security or consumer protectionrelated laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by data protection authorities which we refer to as “supervisory authorities” governmental entities or others including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions would subject us to significant awards fines penalties judgments and negative publicity arising from any financial or nonfinancial damages suffered by any individuals this could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business specifically this would likely require us to change our business practices and would increase the costs and complexity of compliance in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers 

paypal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of eu citizens to the us including reliance on binding corporate rules “bcrs” for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and standard contractual clauses “sccs” as approved by the european commission for transfers to and from third parties paypal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of paypal’s eu customers andor employees outside of the eu have compliant transfer mechanisms in october 2015 the european court of justice invalidated useu safe harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon by some paypal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of eu citizens to us companies and paypal entered into sccs with those third parties who had previously relied on the useu safe harbor framework in july 2016 the us and eu authorities agreed on a replacement for safe harbor known as “privacy shield” both the privacy shield framework and sccs are facing legal challenges in the european justice system to the extent that the privacy shield or sccs are invalidated paypal’s ability to process eu personal data with third parties outside of the eu could be jeopardized 

in 2016 the eu adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 the eu data protection regime expands the scope of the eu data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of eu residents imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4 of worldwide turnover or €20 million and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data although the gdpr applies across the eu without a need for local implementing legislation each eu member state has the ability to interpret the gdpr opening clauses which permit regionspecific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a countrybycountry basis implementation of the gdpr has required us to change our business practices and increased the costs and complexity of compliance 

paypal also faces additional potential challenges from local data protection agencies “dpas” because paypal europe is headquartered in luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction we have relied on the “onestopshop” concept under which luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the eu however a 2015 european court of justice ruling weltimmo affecting companies that do business in the eu potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various eu member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws that are different than and may conflict with luxembourg privacy laws 

in addition because of the large number of text messages emails phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes communicationrelated privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines for example under the telephone consumer protection act “tcpa” in the us plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of 500 per violation whichever is greater and courts may triple the damage award for willful or knowing violations we have been and may continue to be subject to lawsuits including classaction lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the tcpa these lawsuits seek damages including statutory damages and injunctive relief among other remedies given the large number of communications we send to our customers a determination that there have been violations of the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the us and abroad as part of our currency hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities we regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk despite these efforts we may be exposed to the risk of default by or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of these counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default deterioration or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

paypal is not a bank or licensed lender in the us and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business which raises additional risks 

as paypal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state in the us we rely on thirdparty chartered financial institutions to provide paypal branded credit products to our customers in the us including consumer credits products such as paypal credit and paypal branded mastercard credit cards and business credit products such as paypal working capital and paypal business loan products any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability or willingness to lend could interrupt potentially materially our ability to offer consumer and business loan products which could materially and adversely affect our business in the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend we may need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or lending licenses we may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly timeconsuming and uncertain process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements which could be burdensome increase our costs and require us to change our business practices in addition as a service provider to these bank partners which are federally supervised us financial institutions we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators 

in july 2018 we completed the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank for total consideration of 69 billion the purchase price is subject to a postclosing trueup and certain other adjustments under the terms of the purchase agreement as a part of a separate agreement paypal earns a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by synchrony bank which includes both the sold and newly generated receivables and we will not hold an ownership interest in newly generated consumer credit receivables it may take us longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results in addition our increased reliance on synchrony bank subjects us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “risk factors” section under the caption “ we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk ” 

our ability to receive the benefit of our business finance offerings may be subject to challenge 

business loans under our paypal working capital and paypal business loan products are provided by a state chartered industrial bank under a program agreement with us we acquire the receivables generated by those loans after they are originated 

a case decided in the us court of appeals for the second circuit madden v midland funding llc  786 f3d 246 2d cir 2015 resulted in some uncertainty as to whether nonbank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans although the decision specifically addressed preemption under the national bank act this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions including fdicinsured state chartered industrial banks like the issuing bank of loans under paypal working capital and paypal business loan products after the madden  decision there continue to be a number of us state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a nonbank entity enters into a relationship with a thirdparty chartered financial institution for the issuance of credit products while we believe the manner in which paypal branded credit products are offered can be distinguished from madden  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation and an adverse determination could materially and adversely impact our paypal working capital and paypal business loan products and our business 

some of our credit products expose us to additional risks 

we offer our paypal credit consumer product and our paypal working capital and paypal business loan products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in various markets and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk the credit decisioning process for the paypal credit consumer product in markets outside the us uses proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on among other factors their past purchasing and payment history with paypal as well as their credit scores similarly proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who wish to use our business finance offerings to help predict their ability to repay these risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant market conditions economic environment or limited transaction history or other data among other factors the accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements competitors’ actions changes in consumer behavior changes in the economic environment and other factors our international expansion of our credit product offerings also exposes us to additional risks including those discussed in the risk factor captioned “ our international operations subject us to increased risks which could harm our business ” 

like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from merchant credit we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations creating the risk of potential chargeoffs we face similar risks with respect to us consumer credit losses through the profit sharing relationship with synchrony bank the nonpayment rate among account holders may increase due to among other things changes to underwriting standards worsening economic conditions such as a recession or government austerity programs increases in prevailing interest rates and high unemployment rates account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans 

we currently purchase receivables related to the paypal branded merchant credit products in the us if we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a costeffective manner or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes our business could be harmed 

catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business 

war terrorism political events geopolitical instability trade barriers and restrictions public health issues natural disasters or other catastrophic events have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global regional or countryspecific basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business our customers and companies with which we do business such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers our corporate headquarters are located in the silicon valley which is a seismically active region in california our business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters fire power shortages earthquakes floods nuclear power plant accidents and events beyond our control such as other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes and public health issues a catastrophic event that results in a disruption or failure of our systems or operations could result in significant losses and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate 

our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions and consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description in addition consumers who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer usually a bank which in turn will seek recovery from us the risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers sellers and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements or changes that we decide to implement such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs increases in our loss rate including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs could harm our business 

our international operations subject us to increased risks which could harm our business 

our international operations have generated approximately onehalf of our net revenues in recent years there are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic ie incountry and crossborder basis including but not limited to 



 

violations of the complex foreign and us laws rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion may increase our costs of doing business internationally and could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets including assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts a low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our investment income and our net income in addition fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

we have entered into a revolving credit facility and a 364day delayeddraw term loan credit facility we have borrowed under these credit facilities from time to time and any borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate exposing us to interest rate fluctuations 

use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business 

our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses including money laundering terrorist financing illegal online gambling fraudulent sales of goods or services illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances piracy of software movies music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods in particular digital goods bank fraud child pornography human trafficking prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products securities fraud pyramid or ponzi schemes or to facilitate other illegal activity use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses has subjected us and may subject us in the future to claims individual and class action lawsuits and government and regulatory investigations inquiries or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us moreover certain activity that may be legal in one jurisdiction may be illegal in another jurisdiction and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods resulting in liability for us changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and government authorities may consider additional paymentsrelated proposals from time to time owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions including paypal that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm and any resulting liabilities loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business 

our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business 

we hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers including balances in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services or recipients of person to person “p2p” transactions in certain jurisdictions where we operate we are required to hold eligible liquid assets as defined by the relevant regulators in each jurisdiction equal to at least 100  of the aggregate amount of all customer balances our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls as our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls paypal europe with the permission of the cssf utilizes certain european customer balances held by our luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to certain customers our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines which could materially harm our business 

we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws 

we are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under us and foreign laws and regulations including antitrust and competition laws an increasing number of governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us individual states other countries or the european commission or otherwise constitute unfair competition our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation some regulators particularly those outside of the us may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive any claims or investigations even if without merit may be very expensive to defend or respond to involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in reputational harm significant judgments fines or remedial actions against us or require us to change our business practices 

we are subject to patent litigation 

we have been sued repeatedly for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents at any given time we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits we expect that we will continue to be subject to patent infringement claims because among other reasons 

 

such claims may be brought directly against us or against our users whom we may indemnify because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter we believe that many of the claims against us and other technology companies have been and continue to be initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims in addition we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries patent claims whether meritorious or not are timeconsuming and costly to manage defend and resolve and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings or cease conducting certain operations which would harm our business 

we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business 

effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights 

although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business 

as the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others the ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and regardless of the outcome any such claim with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business and require us to among other things redesign or stop providing our products or services pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters may harm or restrict our business 

we are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory actions and government inquiries 

we are regularly subject to claims individual and class action lawsuits government and regulatory investigations inquiries actions or requests and other proceedings alleging violations of laws rules and regulations with respect to competition antitrust intellectual property privacy data protection information security antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing sanctions anticorruption consumer protection fraud accessibility securities tax labor and employment commercial disputes services charitable fundraising contract disputes escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property those matters described in note 13—“commitments and contingencies—litigation and regulatory matters—general matters” to our consolidated financial statements and other matters in particular our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation as discussed above the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries may increase as our business expands in scale scope and geographic reach and our products and services increase in scale and complexity in addition the laws rules and regulations affecting our business including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce data protection payments services and credit are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations 

the scope outcome and impact of claims lawsuits government investigations disputes and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such matters can have an adverse impact which may be material on our business results of operations or financial condition because of legal costs diversion of management resources reputational damage and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex factintensive process that involves a high degree of judgment resolving one or more of such legal and regulatory proceedings or other matters could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings any of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services require us to change our business practices in costly ways or develop noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

while certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions including the class action waiver provisions in the future or in any given case legislative administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of predispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits including additional consumer class action litigation and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation 

changes in us tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow results of operations and financial conditions 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” the tax act made changes to the corporate tax rate businessrelated deductions and taxation of foreign earnings among others that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 throughout calendar year 2018 the us treasury and certain states issued proposed and final legislation and clarifying guidance with respect to the various provisions of the tax act additional legislation and guidance is expected to be issued in 2019 which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our us deferred tax assets result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods and increase our future us tax expense we are continuing to evaluate the tax act and its requirements as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate at this stage it is unclear how many us states will continue to incorporate these federal law changes or portions thereof into their tax codes the implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the tax act may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company the use of estimates in our financial statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions 

like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign authorities and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by authorities throughout the world any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient 

in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of losses in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items 

various levels of government such as us federal and state legislatures and international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” and the eu are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate 

we and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and recordkeeping obligations 

a number of us states the us federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or recordkeeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance additionally a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes we have modified our systems to meet known requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and recordkeeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions and harm our business in addition in june 2018 the us supreme court ruled in south dakota v wayfair inc  that states may collect internet sales tax on online purchases made outside of the state which could adversely affect some of our merchants and indirectly harm our customers 

acquisitions joint ventures strategic investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business 

acquisitions joint ventures strategic investments and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses technologies services products and other assets as well as joint ventures strategic investments and commercial and strategic partnerships these transactions may involve significant challenges uncertainties and risks including 

 

at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions any of which could individually or in the aggregate be material to our financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt and increased interest expense recognize liabilities and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or writeoffs of goodwill or intangibles which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness as applicable 

we completed our acquisition of izettle ab publ “izettle” on september 20 2018 prior to the closing of the acquisition the uk competition and markets authority “cma” initiated a review of the transaction on december 5 2018 the cma referred the acquisition for a phase 2 investigation and on december 24 2018 directed paypal to appoint a monitoring trustee the deadline for the final decision is may 21 2019 paypal is working cooperatively with the cma and has agreed to hold parts of the paypal and izettle businesses separate as agreed with the cma pending completion of the cma’s investigation our ability to successfully and timely integrate izettle’s business and operations with ours and realize the potential synergies and anticipated benefits from the acquisition is subject to the timing and possible outcome of the cma’s review the cma has broad discretion and may impose requirements limitations or costs mandate remedies such as divestitures of certain business assets or place additional restrictions on the conduct of our businesses to ensure sufficient competition in the uk market no assurance can be given as to the ultimate impact and outcome of the cma review that approval from the cma will be obtained or the terms and conditions of such approval 

because acquisitions are inherently risky our transactions may not be successful and may in some cases harm our operating results or financial condition any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt and increased interest expense recognize liabilities and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or impairment of goodwill or intangibles which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness as applicable 

joint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of influence over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control joint ventures or companies in which we invest may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand 

there are risks associated with our indebtedness 

we have incurred indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase our borrowing costs if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under out indebtedness may increase in addition any downgrades to our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business including the following 

 

because we rely on third parties to provide certain of our services and to facilitate certain of our business activities we face increased operational risk these third parties may be subject to financial legal regulatory and labor issues cybersecurity incidents privacy breaches service terminations disruptions or interruptions or other problems which may impose additional costs or requirements on us or prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers on our behalf which could harm our business in addition these third parties may breach their agreements with us disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all fail or refuse to process transactions or provide other services adequately take actions that degrade the functionality of our services impose additional costs or requirements on us or our customers or give preferential treatment to competitive services there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers on our behalf will continue to do so on acceptable terms or at all if any third parties do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or our customers on our behalf we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all and we may be subject to business disruptions losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies customer dissatisfaction reputational damage legal or regulatory proceedings or other adverse consequences which could harm our business 

our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks 

we have announced several retail point of sale solutions which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to or otherwise communicating with a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale we have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing credit and debit cards via paypal at the point of sale those agreements provide us with access to each of these partners tokenization services in the us for instore pointofsale paypal transactions which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process we believe that our recent acquisition of izettle will enable us to further expand our instore presence as we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale we will face additional risks including 

 

unless we are able to successfully manage these risks including driving adoption of and significant volume through our retail point of sale solutions over time our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on key personnel because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of key personnel could harm our ability to maintain and grow our business 

our future success and performance are significantly dependent upon the continued services of key personnel including our executive team and other highly skilled employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate such personnel competition for key personnel is intense especially in the san francisco bay area where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high and we may be unable to successfully attract integrate or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel in making employment decisions particularly in the technology and payments industries job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment and our stock price volatility or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies may make it more difficult to attract retain and motivate employees we may be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies potential changes in us immigration policy may make it difficult to renew or obtain visas for any highly skilled personnel that we have hired or are actively recruiting negative sentiments towards the us as a result of these potential changes may also adversely affect our international recruiting efforts furthermore legislative or administrative changes to immigration or visa laws and regulations may impair our hiring processes or projects involving personnel who are not citizens of the country where the work is to be performed in addition we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or if we are not able to attract or retain highly qualified key personnel effectively could harm our business and growth prospects 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services 

companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them including claims alleging defamation libel harassment hate speech breach of contract invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through the services among other things the laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges we are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customerprovided content on our products and services particularly in jurisdictions outside the us where the applicable laws are unsettled if we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings which could harm our business 

risks related to our separation from ebay 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” ebay paypal and ebay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

on july 17 2015 we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by ebay inc of 100 of our outstanding common stock to ebay’s stockholders which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution” ebay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code the opinion was based on and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of ebay and of us including those relating to the past and future conduct of ebay and of us if any of these representations statements or undertakings were or became inaccurate or incomplete or if ebay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution together with certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if the irs determines that any of these representations assumptions or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or any court and there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion the irs did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is taxfree 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code in general ebay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the paypal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value ebay stockholders who received paypal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities 

there are risks associated with our relationship with ebay 

in connection with our separation from ebay we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with ebay as well as various other agreements including an operating agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a data sharing addendum and a product development agreement the separation agreement the tax matters agreement the employee matters agreement and the intellectual property matters agreement determined the allocation of assets and liabilities including by means of licensing between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations the operating agreement the data sharing addendum and the product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between ebay and us related to payment processing credit and data sharing disputes between ebay and us have arisen and others may arise in the future an adverse outcome in such matters could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition if either we or ebay are unable to satisfy our performance payment or indemnification obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to ebay 

our relationship with ebay is governed in part by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years expiring july 2020 this operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with ebay as well as certain obligations and restrictions that limit paypal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of ebay as specified in the operating agreement ebay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income we expect the portion of our revenue and operating income attributable to ebay to continue to decline due to various factors many of which are beyond our control including the expiration or earlier termination of the operating agreement with ebay and the extent to which ebay intermediates payments on its platform including by acting as a merchant of record limits the availability of paypal as a payment option or offers or promotes alternative payment options directs transactions on its platforms to different providers of payment services or eliminates or modifies its risk management or customer protection programs on its platforms which could result in customer dissatisfaction reduction in ebay volume and other consequences adverse to our business if we are unable to generate sufficient business from our nonebay customers to offset the expected reduction in the portion of our business attributable to ebay it could materially impact the growth in our business and our ability to meet our longterm financial targets 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

as a result of these and other factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock in addition the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies like us these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance in addition in the past some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits the filing of a lawsuit against us regardless of the outcome could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines the state courts of the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers alternatively if a court outside of delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 

we have also elected not to be governed by section 203 of the dgcl which provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation however contains a provision that generally mirrors section 203 of the dgcl except that it provides for a 20 threshold instead of the 15 provided for by the dgcl these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor 

while these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers they will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

business environment 

we are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide paypal is committed to democratizing financial services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy our goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world anytime on any platform and using any device we also facilitate persontoperson “p2p” payments through our paypal venmo and xoom products our combined payment solutions including our paypal paypal credit braintree venmo xoom and izettle products compose our proprietary payments platform 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy cybersecurity and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation new or changing laws and regulations including how such laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have significantly increased in recent years we are not immune to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future for additional information regarding our information security risks see “item 1a risk factors” under the caption—“ cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation business and financial condition ” 

the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in june 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government initiated the exit process under article 50 of the treaty on european union which commenced a twoyear period expiring on march 29 2019 after which time the uk is expected to leave the eu in the absence of any effective extension to the article 50 period political negotiations are underway however there is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the uks exit from the eu and the terms of the uks future relationship with the eu the uks financial service regulators are implementing temporary permission regimes “tpr” that are expected to be put in place by the uks government to support european economic area “eea” financial service firms in continuing to conduct business in the uk should the uk exit the eu without an agreement the final tpr rules are expected to be published in the first quarter of 2019 and will come into effect when the uk leaves the eu accordingly we may need to adjust our business to comply with additional legal and regulatory requirements if accessing the tpr we are currently unable to determine the impact that brexit will have on our business as any impact will depend in part on the outcome of tariff trade regulatory and other negotiations for additional information on how brexit could affect our business see “item 1a risk factors” under the caption—“ the united kingdom’s departure from the eu could adversely affect us ” 

brexit could adversely affect uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro we have foreign exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency rate movements 

in 2018  2017  and 2016  net revenues generated from our uk operations constituted 11  11  and 12  respectively of total net revenues in 2018  2017  and 2016  net revenues generated from the eu excluding the uk constituted less than 20  of total net revenues approximately 31 and 30 of our gross loans and interest receivables as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively were generated from our uk operations approximately 7 and 5 of our gross loans and interest receivables as of december 31 2018 and 2017 respectively were generated from the eu excluding the uk operations

 not meaningful 

net revenues increased   24 billion  or 18  in 2018  and 23 billion  or 21  in 2017  the increase was primarily driven by growth in tpv as defined below under “net revenues” of 27  in 2018  and 27  in 2017  net revenues from our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate in 2018 the increase from the impact of acquisitions was offset by a decrease in interest and fee income due to the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank in july 2018 which resulted in a negative impact of approximately four percentage points to the net revenues growth rate in 2018 in 2017 net revenues from our acquisitions of tio and swift were not material 

total operating expenses increased   23 billion  or 21  in 2018  and 17 billion  or 18  in 2017  the increase  in 2018  was due primarily to an increase  in transaction expense general and administrative transaction and loan loss sales and marketing and restructuring and other expenses operating expenses related to our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate in total operating expenses in 2018  in march 2018 management decided to wind down tios operations the increase in total operating expense in 2017  was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense sales and marketing general and administrative product development and restructuring and other charges operating expenses related to tio and swift collectively contributed one percentage point to the 2017 growth rate 

operating income increased   67 million  or 3  in 2018  and increased   541 million  or 34  in 2017  operating income increased  in 2018  and 2017  due primarily to the increase  in net revenues offset by the growth in operating expenses our acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017 collectively had a negative impact of approximately seven percentage points to the 2018  growth rate in operating income our acquisitions in 2017 collectively had a negative impact of four percentage points on our 2017 growth rate in operating income our operating margin was 14  16  and 15  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively operating margin in 2018  was negatively impacted by growth in our transaction expense which increased 26  in 2018  compared to net revenues which increased 18  in the same period as well as the negative impact of acquisitions these impacts in 2018 were partially offset by operating efficiencies in our business operating margin in 2017  was negatively impacted by growth in our transaction expense which increased 32  in 2017  compared to net revenues which increased 21  in the same period as well as restructuring expense of 40 million  incurred in 2017  these impacts in 2017  were offset by operating efficiencies in our business and a onetime benefit of 322 million pertaining to reversal of allowances related to loans and interest receivables due to the designation as held for sale of our us consumer credit portfolio in november 2017 

net income increased  by 262 million  or 15  in 2018  and 394 million  or 28  in 2017  the increase  in net income in 2018  was attributable to an increase  in operating income of 67 million  and an increase  in other income expense net of 109 million  which was driven by unrealized gains on equity investments and an increase in interest income partially offset by an increase in interest expense the increase in net income was further impacted by a decrease  in income tax expense of 86 million  primarily driven by a reduction in net tax expense recognized with respect to the tax act partially offset by an increase in tax expense due to the increase in operating income and other income expense net the increase in net income in 2017  was attributable to an increase  in operating income of 541 million  and an increase  in other income expense net of 28 million  partially offset by an increase  in income tax expense of 175 million

impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

we have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar in 2018  2017  and 2016  we generated approximately 46  46  and 47  of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the united states respectively because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods including during the periods presented we are subject to the risks of doing business in countries outside of the us as discussed under “item 1a risk factors— risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition ” 

we calculate the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings 

in the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  the yearoveryear foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar had the following impact on our reported results 

while we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure 

additionally in connection with our services that are paid for in multiple currencies we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities 

financial results 

net revenues 

due to the diversification of paypal’s business through strategic partnerships new products and acquisitions in the first quarter of 2018 we updated our definitions of “active accounts” and “total payment volume tpv” as described below 

active accounts  an active account is an account registered directly with paypal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our payments platform not including gatewayexclusive transactions within the past 12 months the definition of active accounts has been expanded to include payments made or outstanding balances held on our cobranded credit card program the definition has also been expanded to include accounts from our platform access partners a platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to paypal’s payments platform through such third party’s login credentials this expanded definition captures uniquely identifiable accounts for which paypal receives economic benefits for completed transactions processed on behalf of customers who have established a relationship with paypal 

total payment volume  the value of payments net of reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions the definition of tpv has been expanded to include paypal’s diversification into new partner payment solutions such as certain tokenized transactions and contextual commerce which expand our opportunities for growth 

the revised definition also captures tpv from our merchant debit card program due to their inclusion in tpv revenues from these transactions were reclassified from “other value added services” to “transaction revenues” with no change to “total net revenues” 

these revisions also impacted previously reported results for other nonfinancial key performance metrics including number of payment transactions and payment transactions per active account prior period metrics have been revised in this filing to conform to the new definitions 

our revenues are classified into the following two categories 

  

 our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following 

  

 net revenues analysis 

the components of our net revenue for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



1 amounts in the prior period were reclassified to conform to current period presentation 

transaction revenues 

transaction revenues increased by 22 billion  or 19  in 2018  compared to 2017  and by 19 billion  or 20  in 2017  compared to 2016  the increase in transaction revenues in 2018  and 2017  was due primarily to the growth in tpv mainly from our paypal and braintree products and in the number of payment transactions both of which resulted primarily from an increase in our active accounts current year acquisitions did not have a material impact on the growth rate of transaction revenues however they contributed approximately 29 million new active accounts during the year net losses from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2018  were 23 million  compared to net gains of 17 million  in 2017  refer to “note 10—derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program 

the following table provides a summary of our active accounts number of payment transactions tpv and related metrics 



all amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million except as otherwise noted as a result certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided 

1  prior period amounts were revised to reflect updated definitions of active accounts and tpv discussed above 

2 reflects active accounts as of the end of the applicable period an active account is an account registered directly with paypal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our payments platform not including gatewayexclusive transactions within the past 12 months 

3  number of payment transactions are the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

4  number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period divided by active accounts at the end of the period 

5  tpv is the value of payments net of reversals successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by paypal via a partner payment solution not including gatewayexclusive transactions 

 not meaningful 

transaction revenues grew more slowly than both tpv and number of payment transactions in 2018  due to a higher proportion of p2p transactions primarily from our paypal and venmo products from which we earn lower fees and a lower proportion of cross border transactions transaction revenues grew more slowly than both tpv and the number of payment transactions in 2017  due primarily to a higher proportion of p2p transactions primarily from our paypal and venmo products the impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2018  or 2017  

other value added services 

net revenues from other value added services increased by 149 million  or 9  in 2018  compared to 2017  and by 336 million  or 27  in 2017  compared to 2016  growth in net revenues from other valueadded services in 2018  and 2017  was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our loans receivable portfolio in 2018 net revenue from other value added services was also positively impacted by growth in interest earned on customer balances the completion of the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio in july 2018 resulted in lower interest and fee income in the second half of 2018 partially offset by an increase in revenue share with synchrony bank and approximately 109 million of revenue earned from transition servicing activities swift revenues contributed approximately nine percentage points and three percentage points to the 2018  and 2017  growth rates respectivelythe total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance including loans and receivables held for sale as of december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  was 27 billion  78 billion  and 57 billion respectively which reflected a yearoveryear decrease of 66  in 2018  compared to 2017  and an increase of 37 in 2017  compared to 2016  the decline in 2018  was primarily driven by the completion of the sale of us consumer credit receivables portfolio 

in november 2017 we reached an agreement to sell our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank to free up balance sheet capacity and cash flow for other uses and mitigate balance sheet risk historically this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances net of any participation interest sold and pro rata allowances including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees upon approval by our board of directors of the decision to sell these receivables the portfolio was reclassified as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value due to the designation as held for sale the associated allowance for this portfolio was reversed resulting in an increase of approximately 39 million in revenue from other value added services in 2017  

following the closing of this transaction in july 2018 synchrony bank became the exclusive issuer of the paypal credit online consumer financing program in the us and we no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program other than receivables that have been or are designated to be charged off and are fully reserved the transaction was accounted for as a true sale and following the completion of the sale the receivables are no longer reported on our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the sale we earn a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by synchrony bank which is recorded in net revenues from other value added services we expect this transaction to negatively impact other valueadded services revenue growth for the first two quarters of 2019 the corresponding negative impact on total net revenue growth rate for each of those quarters is expected to be between 6 and 8 although this estimate is subject to various uncertainties and the actual impact may be different 

operating expenses 

the following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each 



1 transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by tpv prior year rates were revised to reflect updated tpv definition as discussed above 

2 transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by tpv prior year rates were revised to reflect updated tpv definition as discussed above 

 not meaningful 

transaction expense 

transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment these costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction we refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix” the cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a paypal account balance or paypal credit as we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers our funding mix may change which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate the cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the us than in the us 

transaction expense increased  by 12 billion  or 26  in 2018  compared to 2017  and increased  by 11 billion  or 32  in 2017  compared to 2016  the increase in transaction expense in 2018  was primarily attributable to an increase in tpv of 27  the increase in transaction expense in 2017  was primarily attributable to an increase in tpv of 27  and higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions 

the transaction expense rate in 2018  remained relatively consistent with the transaction expense rate for 2017  the increase in our transaction expense rate in 2017  compared to 2016  was due primarily to higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  approximately 2  of tpv was funded with paypal credit for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  approximately 43  43  and 44  of tpv respectively was generated outside of the us 

transaction and loan losses 

transaction losses include the expense associated with our buyer and seller protection programs fraud and chargebacks loan losses include the losses associated with our merchant and consumer loans receivable portfolio except loans and interest receivable held for sale our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors including tpv macroeconomic conditions changes to our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants 

the components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  were as follows 



1 transaction loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction losses by tpv prior year rates were revised to reflect updated tpv definition as discussed above 

transaction and loan losses increased  by 263 million  or 26  in 2018  compared to 2017  and decreased  by 77 million  or 7  in 2017  compared to 2016  

transaction losses increased  by 236 million  or 29  in 2018  compared to 2017  and increased  by 168 million  or 26  in 2017  compared to 2016  due primarily to higher tpv our transaction loss rate remained flat in 2018  2017  and 2016  

loan losses increased  by 27 million  or 14  in 2018  compared to 2017  and decreased  by 245 million  or 57  in 2017  compared to 2016  the increase in loan losses in 2018  was primarily due to the increase in our merchant loans and advances receivable balances partially offset by a decline resulting from the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio in the third quarter of 2018 and the portfolios designation as held for sale during the first two quarters of 2018 the decrease in loan losses in 2017  was due primarily to the reversal of approximately 283 million of allowance on loans receivable due to the designation of our us consumer credit portfolio as held for sale 

the consumer loans receivable balance as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was 704 million  326 million  and 51 billion respectively reflecting a yearoveryear increase of 116  from 2017  to 2018  and a decrease of 94 from 2016  to 2017  the increase in consumer loan receivables in 2018  was due to growth in international markets approximately 93 of our consumer loans receivables outstanding as of december 31 2018 and december 31 2017 were due from consumers in the uk the decrease in consumer loan receivables in 2017  was due to the designation of us consumer credit portfolio as held for sale

2  net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year 

we offer business financing solutions to certain small and mediumsized merchants total merchant loans advances and interest and fees receivable outstanding as of december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  net of participation interest sold were 19 billion  10 billion  and 558 million respectively reflecting a yearoveryear increase of 85  from 2017  to 2018  and an increase of 81 from 2016  to 2017  the increase in merchant receivables in 2018  was due to growth in our paypal business loan “ppbl” portfolio and an increase in the availability of our paypal working capital “ppwc” product approximately 87 and 10 of our merchant receivables outstanding as of december 31 2018 were due from merchants in the us and uk as compared to 83 and 13 as of december 31 2017 respectively the increase in merchant receivables in 2017  was due to the acquisition of swift which included their preexisting loan receivables portfolio and an increase in the availability of our ppwc product domestically and internationally

product development 

product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the development of our payments platform new products and the improvement of our existing products product development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized the amortization of developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense

restructuring and other charges primarily consist of restructuring expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables held for sale portfolio restructuring and other charges increased by 177 million  in 2018  compared to 2017  due to an increase of 152 million in cost adjustments which were primarily driven by chargeoffs against loans and interest receivables held for sale portfolio prior to its sale in july 2018 and a net loss of 40 million incurred at the conclusion of this sale restructuring and other charges increased by 132 million  in 2017  compared to 2016  due to restructuring charges of 40 million  and cost adjustments of 92 million which were driven by chargeoffs against our us consumer credit receivables portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in november 2017 

in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 management approved strategic reductions of the existing global workforce which resulted in restructuring charges of 25 million  and 40 million  respectively the reduction approved in the first quarter of 2018 also included restructuring charges related to the decision to wind down tio operations we incurred employee and severance benefits expenses under both the 2018 and 2017 strategic reductions which were substantially completed by the end of 2018 and 2017 respectively no restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016

income tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act included significant changes to the us corporate income tax system including a federal corporate rate reduction from 35 to 21 limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation creation of new minimum taxes such as the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” and global intangible low taxed income “gilti” tax and the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system which resulted in a one time us tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the us the “transition tax” 

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act we recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of 180 million for the period ended december 31 2017 this discrete expense consisted of provisional estimates of 1468  million net expense for the transition tax payable in installments over eight years 1295  million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings and 7 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assetsliabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance 

during the year ended december 31 2018  we completed our accounting for the income tax effects of the tax act we recognized additional discrete net tax expense of 20 million  to the provisional amounts recorded at december 31 2017 for the enactmentdate effects of the tax act for a total of 200 million  of discrete net tax expense the 200 million  of total discrete net expense consists of 1490  million of net federal and state transition tax the majority of which is payable in installments over eight years 1295  million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings and 5 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance we elected to account for gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred legislation and clarifying guidance is expected to continue to be issued by the us treasury and various states in 2019 which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our us deferred tax assets result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods and increase our future us tax expense 

our effective tax rate was 13  in 2018  18  in 2017  and 14  in 2016  the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018  was primarily due to a favorable shift in earnings and discrete net tax expense recorded for us tax reform in 2017 partially offset by reduced tax benefits for us expenses in 2018 due to the lower us tax rate the increase in our effective tax rate in 2017  was primarily due to discrete net tax expense recorded for us tax reform partially offset by the adoption of the new stockbased compensation accounting standard in 2017 see “note 16—income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information on our effective tax rate 

nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that create differences between the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” pursuant to the requirements of regulation sk the following portion of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” includes a reconciliation of certain nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures the presentation of nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 

we present nongaap financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparisons of our results between periods management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation 

we exclude the following items from nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share nongaap operating income nongaap operating margin and nongaap effective tax rate 

 the following tables provide reconciliations of our consolidated nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016  



1 elimination of allowance on interest receivable due to the us consumer credit portfolio designation as held for sale   



1 includes 30 million impairment related to a portion of acquired tio customerrelated intangible assets in 2017   

2 includes net loss 40 million related to the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio for the year ended december 31 2018 includes elimination of allowance on loans receivable 283 million allowance on interest receivable 39 million due to the designation of the us consumer credit portfolio as held for sale certain fees associated with the sale of the portfolio 5 million and impairment of an investment in an intellectual property fund 15 million for the year ended december 31 2017   



1 years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 include tax expense related to the tax act 20 million and 180 million respectively   and intraentity transfer of intellectual property 23 million and 44 million respectively   

in addition to the nongaap measures discussed above we also use free cash flow to assess our performance free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment and investments in our payments platform which can then be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and repurchase stock a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is presented below 



1 the year ended december 31 2018 includes a positive impact of approximately 14 billion due to the completion of the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio in july 2018 the year ended december 31 2017 includes a negative impact of approximately 13 billion due to the change in presentation of the us consumer credit receivables portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in november 2017

credit facilities 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we entered into a credit agreement “2017 credit agreement” that provided for an unsecured 30 billion  364 day delayeddraw term loan credit facility which was available in up to three  borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2018 we entered into an amended credit agreement “amended credit agreement” which amends and restates in its entirety the 2017 credit agreement the amended credit agreement provides for an unsecured 50 billion  364 day delayeddraw term loan credit facility which is available in up to four  separate borrowings funds borrowed under the amended credit agreement may be used to repurchase equity securities from shareholders to repay intercompany debt and for other general corporate purposes of the company and our subsidiaries amounts available under the amended credit agreement may be borrowed until april 2019 subject to customary borrowing conditions and the amended credit agreement will terminate in november 2019 

in the first quarter of 2018 we effected two drawdowns aggregating to 20 billion  under the 2017 credit agreement which were in addition to the outstanding balance of 10 billion  as of december 31 2017  in the second quarter of 2018 we repaid 10 billion  of the borrowings outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement the borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2018  and 2017  bore interest at libor of one month plus a margin of 1125  resulting in a weighted average interest rate of 334  and 278  respectively as of december 31 2018  20 billion  was outstanding under the amended credit agreement accordingly at december 31 2018  30 billion  of borrowing capacity was available in up to four drawdowns for the purposes permitted by the amended credit agreement subject to customary conditions to borrowing 

in 2015 we entered into a credit agreement “2015 credit agreement” and collectively with the amended credit agreement the “credit agreements” that provides for an unsecured 20 billion  five year revolving credit facility that includes a 150 million  letter of credit subfacility and a 150 million  swingline subfacility with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time we may subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 500 million  funds borrowed under the 2015 credit agreement may be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes the 2015 credit agreement will terminate in july 2020 

during the third quarter of 2017 we drew down 800 million  under the 2015 credit agreement which was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2017 the borrowing bore interest at libor of one month plus a margin of 1125  resulting in a weightedaverage interest rate of 236  as of december 31 2018  no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the 2015 credit agreement accordingly at december 31 2018  20 billion  of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2015 credit agreement subject to customary conditions to borrowing 

we also maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with borrowing capacity of approximately 300 million  in the aggregate interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings as of december 31 2018  no amounts were outstanding under these facilities and therefore approximately 300 million  of borrowing capacity was available subject to customary conditions to borrowing 

for additional information regarding the terms of our credit facilities refer to “note 12—notes payable” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes the arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution “aggregate cash deposits” the arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreedupon limit the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements as of december 31 2018  we had a total of 43 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our 43 billion in aggregate cash deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement 

liquidity for credit portfolio growth 

growth in the portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business we continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding of our credit portfolio in june 2018 the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” agreed that paypal’s management may designate up to 35  of european customer balances held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit for european and us credit activities as of december 31 2018 the cumulative amount approved by management to be designated for credit activities aggregated to 15 billion  and represented approximately 26  of european customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the cssf no additional amount has been designated for corporate usage by management during the year ended december 31 2018 we may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances if necessary based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal under certain exceptional circumstances corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our european customer balances 

in november 2017 we reached an agreement to sell our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank historically this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances net of any participation interest sold and pro rata allowances including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees in july 2018 we completed the transaction for total consideration of 69 billion  which includes cash consideration of 65 billion  and a longterm receivable in the amount of 426 million  which was recorded at that time at its present value of 261 million  following the closing of this transaction synchrony bank became the exclusive issuer of the paypal credit online consumer financing program in the us and we no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program other than charged off or designated to be charged off receivables 

credit ratings 

as of december 31 2018  we continue to be rated investment grade by standard and poors financial services llc and fitch ratings inc we expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance including our capital structure and results of operations our goal is to be rated investment grade but as circumstances change there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading if that were to occur it could increase our borrowing rates including the interest rate on loans under the credit agreements 

risk of loss 

the risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers merchants and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations in and changes or modifications to the programs including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report our transaction loss rates calculated by dividing transaction loss by tpv was 018  of tpv historical trends may not be an indication of future results 

acquisitions and stock repurchases 

in july 2018 we completed our acquisition of simility for approximately 107 million  in cash we acquired simility to enhance our ability to deliver fraud prevention and risk management solutions to merchants globally 

in september 2018 we completed our acquisition of izettle for approximately 21 billion  in cash net of cash acquired of 103 million  and 22 million  in equity we acquired izettle to expand our instore presence and strengthen our payments platform to help small businesses around the world grow and thrive in an omnichannel retail environment 

in november 2018 we completed our acquisition of hyperwallet for approximately 399 million  in cash we acquired hyperwallet to enhance our payout capabilities and improve our ability to provide an integrated suite of payment solutions to ecommerce platforms and marketplaces around the world 

during the year ended   december 31 2018  we repurchased approximately 25 billion of our common stock through open market repurchases and approximately 10 billion pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement under our stock repurchase programs as of december 31 2018  a total of approximately 115 billion  remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs during the year ended   december 31 2017  we repurchased approximately 10 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs as of december 31 2017  a total of approximately 50 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs our programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and subject to market conditions and other factors may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions block trades privately negotiated transactions including accelerated share repurchase agreements or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from cash from operations or other financing alternatives moreover any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made we may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without notice 

other considerations 

our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating our financial performance and global credit market conditions as well as a broad range of other factors in addition our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see “item 1a risk factors— risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition ” and “note 13—commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and investments cash expected to be generated from operations and our expected access to capital markets together with potential external funding through third party sources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities anticipated capital expenditures and our credit products for the foreseeable future depending on market conditions we may from time to time issue debt including in private or public offerings to fund our operating activities finance acquisitions repurchase shares under our share repurchase programs or reduce our cost of capital 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain noncash expenses timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred and changes in other assets and liabilities significant noncash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation the cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as a negative impact to changes in other assets and liabilities in cash from operating activities the expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our consumer and merchant credit products excluding the us consumer credit portfolio from and after november 2017 actual chargeoffs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit products excluding the us consumer credit portfolio from and after november 2017 have no impact on cash from operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 55 billion  in 2018  primarily due to operating income of approximately 22 billion  and the positive impact of 14 billion  of changes in the loans and interest receivable held for sale net following the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio adjustments for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation were approximately 16 billion  during 2018  adjustments for noncash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately 13 billion  and cost basis adjustments to loans and interest receivable held for sale were 244 million  during 2018  the cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in other assets and liabilities of 708 million  primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period 

we generated cash from operating activities of 25 billion  in 2017  due primarily to operating income of approximately 21 billion  adjustments for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation were approximately 15 billion  during 2017  adjustments for noncash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately 10 billion  during 2017  the cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by adjustments for noncash expenses related to deferred income taxes of approximately 13 billion  during 2017  the cash generated from operating activities was also negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to loans and interest receivable held for sale net of 13 billion  due to changes in the presentation of originations and collections on loans within the us consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in november 2017 which were presented in operating activities instead of investing activities offset by changes in other assets and liabilities of 634 million  collections on the us consumer credit portfolio for originations that occurred prior to november 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 32 billion  in 2016  due primarily to operating income of approximately 16 billion  adjustments for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation including excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation were approximately 11 billion  during 2016  adjustments for noncash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately 11 billion  during 2016  the cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses net 

cash paid for income taxes in 2018  2017  and 2016  was 328 million  117 million  and 48 million  respectively 

investing activities 

cash flows from investing activities includes purchases maturities and sales of investments cash paid for acquisitions purchases and sales of property and equipment changes in principal loans receivable and funds receivable 

we generated cash from investing activities of 840 million  in 2018  due primarily to maturities and sales of investments of 219 billion  changes in principal loans receivable net of 31 billion  and changes in funds receivable from customers of 11 billion  these cash inflows were offset by purchases of investments of 224 billion  acquisitions of 21 billion  net of cash and restricted cash acquired and purchases of property and equipment of 823 million  

the net cash used in investing activities of 45 billion  in 2017  was due primarily to purchases of investments of 194 billion  an increase in funds receivable of 16 billion  including the reclassification of 700 million  of european customer balances held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents changes in principal loans receivable portfolio net of collections originated through our consumer and merchant credit products excluding originations and collections pertaining to the us consumer credit portfolio from and after november 2017 which are presented in operating activities of 920 million  acquisitions net of cash acquired of 323 million  and purchases of property and equipment of 667 million  these net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of 184 billion  collections on the us consumer credit portfolio for originations that occurred prior to november 2017 will continue to be reflected in investing activities 

the net cash used in investing activities of 59 billion  in 2016  was due primarily to purchases of investments of 210 billion  increases in our loan receivable portfolio net of collections originated through our paypal credit products of 15 billion  purchases of property and equipment of 669 million  and net increases in funds receivable of 11 billion  including the reclassification of 800 million of european customer balances held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents these net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of 184 billion  

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock purchases of treasury stock tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards borrowings and repayments under financing arrangements funds payable and amounts due to customers and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation for periods prior to 2017 

the net cash used in financing activities of 13 billion  in 2018  was due primarily to the repurchase of 35 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs repayments of borrowings under financing arrangements of 11 billion  and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of 419 million  partially offset by cash inflows from borrowings under financing arrangements of 21 billion  and changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 16 billion  

the net cash provided by financing activities of 41 billion  in 2017  was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 43 billion  and borrowings of 18 billion  these cash inflows were partially offset by repayments of borrowings of 980 million  including a loan of 170 million assumed in connection with our acquisition of swift the repurchase of 10 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of 166 million  

  

the net cash provided by financing activities of 20 billion  in 2016  was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 30 billion  offset in part by the repurchase of 995 million  of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment 

free cash flow was 47 billion  in 2018  an increase of 28 billion  from 2017  the increase in free cash flow during the period was due to an increase in cash generated from operating activities of 30 billion  which was primarily impacted by changes in the loans and interest receivable held for sale net due to the completion of the sale of that portfolio partially offset by purchases of property and equipment which were 156 million  higher compared to the prior year free cash flow generated during 2018  was used for repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase programs funding our credit portfolio acquisitions and general business purposes 

free cash flow was 19 billion  in 2017  a decrease of 625 million  from 2016  the decrease in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to lower cash generated from operating activities of 627 million  which was impacted by the change in presentation from investing activities to operating activities of originations and collections on the us consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in november 2017 free cash flow generated during 2017  was used for repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase programs funding our credit portfolio acquisitions and general business purposes 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure see “nongaap financial information” for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

effect of exchange rates on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash 

we had a negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash during 2018  of 113 million  due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the australian dollar and to a lesser extent the euro the positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash during 2017  of 36 million  was due to the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the euro currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash in 2016 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

future liquidity and obligations 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 18 billion  of unused credit was available to paypal credit account holders compared to 264 billion  of unused credit as of december 31 2017  while this amount represents the total unused credit available we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all our paypal credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time in addition the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination based on among other things account usage and customer creditworthiness the decrease in unused credit in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due to the sale of our us consumer credit portfolio 

prior to the completion of the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio in july 2018 when a consumer funded a purchase in the us using a paypal credit product issued by a chartered financial institution the chartered financial institution extended credit to the consumer funded the extension of credit at the point of sale and advanced funds to the merchant we purchased the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and as a result of such purchase bore the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults although the chartered financial institution continued to own each customer account we owned the related receivable excluding participation interests sold and were responsible for all servicing functions related to the account subsequent to the completion of the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio in july 2018 we no longer purchase the receivables related to us consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution 

we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes changes in our business needs contractual cancellation provisions fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2018  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations 



the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows 

 

 

 as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits net the table above does not include 615 million of such noncurrent liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2018  

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues no individual quarter in 2018  2017  or 2016  accounted for more than 30 of annual net revenue 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in “note 1 — overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates require regular review and adjustment 

transaction and loan losses 

transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud chargebacks and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors including total tpv macroeconomic conditions changes to our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products which include our paypal credit consumer product and merchant loans and advances arising from our ppwc and ppbl products 

we establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchantrelated chargebacks due to nondelivery of goods or services ach returns buyer protection program claims account takeovers and account overdrafts additions to the allowance in the form of provisions are reflected in transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statements of income the allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances internal factors including experience with similar cases historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 

we also establish an allowance for loans receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our merchant loans and advances and consumer loans receivable increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our consolidated financial statements this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments in connection with the sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank and the designation of that portfolio as held for sale in november 2017 we released corresponding allowances against those loans and interest receivable balances no allowances were established on any newly originated us consumer loan receivables from and after november 2017 adjustments to the cost basis of this portfolio which are primarily driven by charge offs are recorded in restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statements of income for our consumer loan receivables not subject to the sale agreements with synchrony bank consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates “roll rates” roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our consumer loan receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to 180  days past the payment due date in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off for merchant loans and advances receivable the allowance is primarily based on principal balances forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintagebased loss forecasting model 

the allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off the allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintagebased loss forecasting model increases to the allowance for interest receivable are reflected as a reduction of net revenues in our consolidated statements of income increases to the allowance for fees receivable are recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 

determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date based on our results for the year ended december 31 2018  an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately 127 million  

accounting for income taxes 

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax laws and regulations our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the us through new provisions under the tax act such as the new gilti tax and beat or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors including our historical experience and shortrange and longrange business forecasts to the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized we record a valuation allowance 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with us gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return us gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

based on our results for the year ended december 31 2018  a onepercentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately 24 million  

loss contingencies 

we are currently involved in various claims legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims litigation or other violation and may revise our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 

revenue recognition 

application of the accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 

we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist under us gaap the evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the us gaap for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessments we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts we must perform a quantitative impairment test 

under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties present value techniques of estimated future cash flows valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue or a similar performance measure 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and investment risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing funding and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  approximately 78  and 39  respectively of our total cash cash equivalents and investment portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents   the assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheets as customer accounts are maintained in interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits time deposits us and foreign government and agency securities and corporate debt securities we seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in the jurisdictions where we operate equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances we do not pay interest on amounts due to customers 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we entered into an unsecured 30 billion  364  day delayeddraw term loan credit facility which was available in up to three borrowings “2017 credit agreement” in the fourth quarter of 2018 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement “amended credit agreement” which provides for an unsecured 50 billion  364 day delayeddraw term loan credit facility which is available in up to four  separate borrowings in the third quarter of 2015 we entered into a 20 billion  senior unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020 “2015 credit agreement” we also maintain uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world with borrowing capacity of approximately 300 million  in the aggregate 

borrowings under the amended credit agreement and 2015 credit agreement if any bear interest at floating rates as a result we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings as of december 31 2018  we had 20 billion  of borrowings outstanding under the amended credit agreement at a weighted average interest rate of 334  accordingly at december 31 2018  30 billion  of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the amended credit agreement subject to customary conditions to borrowing as of december 31 2018  no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the 2015 credit agreement or our uncommitted credit facilities 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us or to lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact  on our financial assets or liabilities at december 31 2018  and 2017  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may adversely impact our financial results we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services our cash flows results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities we are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts please see “note 10—derivative instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” and subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings if we elect to discontinue our cash flow hedges and it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur we continue to report them in aoci until the forecasted transaction affects earnings at which point we also reclassify the dedesignated hedges into earnings gains and losses on derivatives held after we discontinue our cash flow hedges and gains and losses on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the same financial statement line item to which the derivative relates 

we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 20 at december 31 2018  and 2017  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 707 million  and 536 million  lower respectively if the us dollar strengthened by 20 at december 31 2018  and 2017  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 707 million  and 536 million  higher respectively 

we have an additional foreign currency exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts 

adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 295 million  and 243 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively without considering the offsetting effect of hedging foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2018  would have positively  impacted income before income taxes by approximately 308 million  resulting in a net positive  impact of approximately 13 million  foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2017  would have positively  impacted income before income taxes by approximately 211 million  resulting in a net negative  impact of approximately 32 million  these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term 

investment risk 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  our equity investments totaled 293 million  and 88 million  respectively which represented approximately 3 and 1 of our total cash and investment portfolio at those dates respectively and were related to minority equity interests in companies that are not publicly traded as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we did not hold any marketable equity instruments we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent sales and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data

we generate revenues by charging fees for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services based primarily on the volume of activity processed through our payments platform we generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts however we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange we also earn revenue by providing value added services to consumers and merchants such as our paypal credit and gateway services our gateway services which include our payflow gateway services and braintree gateway services provide the technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and merchant account and enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards 

strategy

key performance metrics 

we measure the relevance of our products to our customers and therefore the success of our business through active customer accounts payment volume and payment transactions 

active customer accounts  an active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products in the past 12 months as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 227 million  active customer accounts across more than 200  markets a market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction such as a country territory or protectorate in which we offer our services a country territory or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations 

number of payment transactions    number of payment transactions is defined as the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products 

total payment volume “tpv”  tpv is the value of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products 

our strengths 

our business is built on a strong foundation designed to drive growth and differentiate us from our competitors we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

technology   

our payments platform utilizes a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by third parties to efficiently and securely facilitate transactions between millions of merchants and consumers worldwide across different channels markets and networks our payments platform connects with financial institutions around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a wide range of payment methods regardless of where a merchant is located consumers who use our payments platform can send payments in more than 200  markets across the globe and in more than 100 currencies withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies and hold balances in their paypal accounts in 25 currencies 

a transaction on our payments platform can involve multiple participants in addition to us including a merchant a consumer and the consumer’s funding source provider we have developed intuitive user interfaces customer tools on our payments platform transaction processing and database and network applications that help our customers utilize our suite of products and services our payments platform open application programming interfaces and developer tools are designed to enable developers to innovate with ease and offer robust applications to our global ecosystem of merchants and consumers while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information 

the technology infrastructure supporting our payments platform simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data and facilitates the deployment and operation of largescale global products and services and automates much of the administration of largescale clusters of computers our technology infrastructure has been designed around industrystandard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences our payments platform incorporates multiple layers of protection both for continuity and system redundancy purposes and to help address cybersecurity challenges we engage in multiple efforts to protect our technology infrastructure and payments platform against these challenges including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities we strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure and payments platform to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency scalability and security 

merchant and consumer payment solutions 

our combined payment solution capabilities offer our merchants and consumers a broad range of products and services enabling our merchants to safely and simply receive payments from their customers while allowing our consumers to make seamless transactions across different markets and networks 

we partner with our merchants to help grow and expand their businesses by improving sales conversion providing global reach offering alternative payment methods reducing losses through proprietary protection programs and leveraging data analytics merchants can onboard quickly with paypal and are not required to invest in new or specialized hardware for our standard service we do not charge merchants setup or recurring fees we offer access to credit products for certain small and mediumsized merchants through paypal working capital and with the recent acquisition of swift financial corporation swift other business loan products our paypal working capital product allows businesses to borrow a certain percentage of their annual payment volume 

processed by paypal for a fee our swift business loan products provide businesses with access to shortterm business financing based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner we believe that our business financing offerings allow us to deepen our engagement with our small and mediumsized business merchants by providing them with access to capital to grow their business that they may not otherwise be able to effectively or efficiently access from traditional banks or other lending providers our recent acquisition of swift also enables us to enhance our underwriting capabilities and strengthen our business financing offerings helping us to deepen relationships with our existing merchants and expand services to new merchants 

paypal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices we believe our braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers and service providers that offer their services primarily through mobile applications through a single braintree integration a merchant can begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards paypal android pay apple pay samsung pay and other payment solutions we also offer gateway services including our payflow gateway services and braintree gateway services that enable merchants to accept payments online with credit or debit cards our gateway services provide the payment gateway technology that links a merchant’s website to its processing network and enable merchants to accept payments online with credit and debit cards 

we focus on providing affordable consumer products intended to democratize the management and movement of money we offer our customers the flexibility to use their account to both purchase and receive payment for goods and services as well as transfer and withdraw funds we enable consumers to more safely exchange funds with merchants using a variety of financial resources which may include a bank account a paypal account balance a paypal credit account a credit or debit card or other stored value products such as coupons and gift cards we generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged for foreign currency exchange and on interest and fees from our paypal credit product we offer our paypal credit product to consumers as a potential funding source at checkout once a consumer is approved for credit paypal credit is made available as a funding source in their account we believe that our consumer credit products allow us to increase engagement with both consumers and merchants on our twosided network as well as differentiate ourselves from rival payment processors by helping merchants drive incremental sales through products like paypal credit we are responsible for all servicing functions related to all of our credit products in the us credit originated through our paypal credit paypal working capital and swift business loan products is currently extended through thirdparty financial institutions from whom we purchase the related receivables for our consumer and merchant credit products outside the us we extend credit through certain international paypal subsidiaries 

during the fourth quarter of 2017 we expanded our strategic consumer credit relationship with synchrony financial synchrony and agreed to sell our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank following the closing of this transaction which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018 synchrony bank will become the exclusive issuer of the paypal credit online consumer financing program in the us and we will no longer hold any participation interest in the receivables generated through the program other than charged off receivables 

we offer consumers persontoperson “p2p” payment solutions through our paypal venmo and xoom products paypal continues to drive the majority of our total p2p volumes enabling both domestic and international p2p transfers across our payments platform our venmo app in the us is a leading mobile application used to move money between friends and family xoom is an international money transfer service that enables our customers to send money to pay bills for and send prepaid mobile phone reloads for family and friends around the world in a secure fast and costeffective way using their mobile device or personal computers p2p is a significant customer acquisition channel with network effects that helps us to establish relationships with potential paypal users by allowing them to join our payments platform at the time of making or receiving p2p payments which drives organic growth 

protecting merchants and consumers 

protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and data loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry and sustainably growing our business fraudulent activities such as account takeover identity theft and counterparty malicious activities represent a significant and growing risk to merchants and consumers as well as their payment partners we provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions completed through our payments platform except for transactions using our gateway and paydiant products we believe that these programs which protect both merchants and consumers from financial and data loss due primarily to fraud and counterparty nonperformance are generally much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry many payment providers do not offer merchant protection in general and those that do generally do not provide protection for online or card not present transactions as a result merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they used our payments services we also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for 180 days post transaction in the markets that we serve we believe that this protection is generally consistent with or better than that offered by other payments providers we believe that as a result of these 

programs consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as described and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer 

our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our proprietary endtoend payments platform and our ability to leverage the data we collect on both sides of the transactions on our twosided network ie from buyers and sellers and from senders and receivers of payments we believe mobile devices will continue to play a significant and increasing role in commerce including by creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer for example paypal is able to use location data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce risk to merchants and consumers our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having paypal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands 

  

competition 

the global payments industry is highly competitive we compete against a wide range of businesses including banks credit card providers technology and ecommerce companies and traditional retailers many of which are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer we compete against all forms of payments including credit and debit cards automated clearing house and bank transfers other online payment services mobile payments and offline payment methods including cash and check 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following 

 

in addition to the discussion in this section see “item 1a risk factors” under the caption “substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business” for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business 

research and development 

total research and development expense was 953 million  834 million  and 792 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

intellectual property 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks particularly those covering the paypal name patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services we have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to and limit disclosure of our proprietary information 

we pursue the registration of our domain names trademarks and service marks in the us and internationally additionally we have filed us and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology we have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the us and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest

government regulation 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation noncompliance with laws and regulations increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate 

payments regulation  various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the us and internationally in the us paypal inc holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent which among other things subjects paypal inc to reporting requirements bonding requirements limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state regulatory agencies outside the us we provide localized versions of our service to customers through various foreign subsidiaries the activities of those nonus entities are or may be supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate among other regulatory authorities the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” the australian securities and investment commission the monetary authority of singapore the reserve bank of india and the central bank of russia have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in country this list is not exhaustive as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change 

banking agency supervision  we serve our customers in the european union through paypal europe sàrl et cie sca a whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg by the cssf consequently we must comply with rules and regulations of the banking industry including those related to capitalization funds management corporate governance antimoney laundering disclosure reporting and inspection we also are or may be subject to bankingrelated regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry in addition based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions we are or may be subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators

interchange fees  interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions for example in the european union eu the multilateral interchange fee “mif” regulation caps credit and debit interchange fees for cards payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card 

transactions including paypal as a result the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge 

data protection and information security  aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the united states us the eu and elsewhere for example the eu has adopted a comprehensive general data protection regulation the gdpr which comes into effect in may 2018 and expands the scope of the eu data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of eu residents imposes a strict data protection compliance regime and includes new rights in the united states we are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act that require the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program and in europe the operations of our luxembourg bank are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the luxembourg banking act among other laws regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux 

anticorruption paypal is subject to applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act and similar anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates anticorruption laws generally prohibit offering promising giving accepting or authorizing others to provide anything of value either directly or indirectly to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage such as to obtain or retain business we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion is divided into three sections the first section which begins immediately following this paragraph discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the second section captioned “risks related to the separation and our operation as an independent publicly traded company” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company the third section captioned “risks related to our common stock” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our common stock you should carefully review all of these sections for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us in addition to the other information appearing in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business   if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business 

the global payments industry is highly competitive and we compete against a wide range of businesses some of which are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer the global payments industry is rapidly changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competition may also intensify as businesses against which we compete or merchants enter into business combinations and alliances and established companies in other segments expand to become competitive with our business 

we compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments including 



 

we often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business competition for relationships with these partners is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish grow or maintain these partner relationships 

we also face competition and potential competition from 

 

some of these competitors have larger customer bases volume scale resources and market share than we do which may provide significant competitive advantages some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing and other regulatory requirements they may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of products and services and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs products and services that adversely impact our growth 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following 

 

if we are not able to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors drive value for our customers or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors 

our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business 

substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as well as the trading price of our common stock 

substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter as a result our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including as a result of the risks set forth in this “risk factors” section it is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings accurately in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline significantly as a result of the factors described in this paragraph 

global and regional economic conditions could harm our business 

our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and other factors these and other global and regional economic events and conditions could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform in addition any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry significant financial service institution failures new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income credit currency and equity markets which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services the use of our products and services and consequently our revenues could decline 

rapid significant and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate including developments in payment card tokenization mobile social commerce ie ecommerce through social networks authentication virtual currencies including distributed ledger technologies and nfc and other proximity payment devices such as contactless payments we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful in addition our ability to adopt new products and services and to develop new technologies may be inhibited by industrywide standards payments networks changes to laws and regulations resistance to change from consumers or merchants thirdparty intellectual property rights or other factors our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable to do so in a timely or costeffective manner our business could be harmed 

changes in how consumers fund their paypal transactions could harm our business 

we pay transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or from an existing paypal account balance or through our paypal credit products our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards collectively “payment cards” which can significantly increase our costs although we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing paypal account balance to fund payment transactions some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards especially if these payment cards offer features and benefits that are not provided as part of their paypal accounts an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix or other events or developments that make it more difficult 

or costly for us to fund transactions with lowercost funding options could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business 

we have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks andor issuing banks to promote greater consumer choice and make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit andor debt cards and to allow us to gain access to these partners’ tokenization services for instore point of sale paypal transactions these arrangements may have an uncertain impact on our business while we anticipate that these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter into in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a payment card which would likely increase the transaction costs associated with our funding mix which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches 

our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data including financial information and information about how they interact with our payments platform in addition a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us we have built our reputation on the premise that our payments platform offers customers a more secure way to make payments an increasing number of organizations including large merchants and businesses other large technology companies financial institutions and government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on their websites and infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to our systems our data or customers data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized until launched against a target unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers partners or vendors or attempting to fraudulently induce often through spear phishing attacks our employees customers partners vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names passwords payment card information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems certain efforts may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect we believe that paypal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and expect to continue to expend significant resources to bolster these protections these security measures cannot provide absolute security our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems our security measures may also be breached due to human error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities actual or perceived breaches of our security could interrupt our operations result in our systems or services being unavailable result in improper disclosure of data materially harm our reputation and brands result in significant regulatory scrutiny and legal and financial exposure cause us to incur significant remediation costs lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services divert the attention of management from the operation of our business result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses to them or claims by them and adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition any cyberattacks or data security breaches affecting companies that we acquire or our customers partners or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects see note 3—business combinations note 4—goodwill and intangible assets and note 13—commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure relating to the suspension of operations of tio networks tio which we acquired in july 2017 as part of an ongoing investigation of security vulnerability of the tio platform actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches have led and may lead to claims against us 

in addition under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses we also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us and the eu have implemented authentication requirements for banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs require us to change our business practices make it more difficult for new customers to join paypal and reduce the ease of use of our products which could harm our business additionally while we maintain insurance policies they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 

systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites applications products or services could harm our business 

our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions computer denialofservice and other cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires natural disasters power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events our systems also may be subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition as a provider of payments solutions we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans which may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or adversely affect the speed or functionality of our products and services these events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue a prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability speed or functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid or reduce the use of our products and services and could permanently harm our reputation and brands moreover if any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims even if unsuccessful would likely be timeconsuming and costly for us to address and could have other consequences described in this “risk factors” section under the caption “our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches” 

our payments platform has experienced and may in the future experience intermittent unavailability the fulltime availability and expeditious delivery of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments we have undertaken certain system upgrades and replatforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed these efforts are costly and timeconsuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fines and penalties and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business 

we also rely on facilities components and services supplied by third parties including data center facilities and cloud storage services if these third parties cease to provide the facilities or services experience operational interference or disruptions breach their agreements with us or fail to perform their obligations and meet our expectations our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which could result in customer dissatisfaction and damage to our reputation and brands and materially and adversely affect our business we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events 

in addition we are continually improving and upgrading our information systems and technologies implementation of new systems and technologies is complex expensive and timeconsuming if we fail to timely and successfully implement new information systems and technologies or improvements or upgrades to existing information systems and technologies or if such systems and technologies do not operate as intended this could have an adverse impact on our business internal controls including internal controls over financial reporting results of operations and financial condition 

changes to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our business 

we rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and pay fees for the services from time to time payment card networks have increased and may increase in the future the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction that accesses their networks payment card networks have or may impose special fees or assessments for transactions that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as paypal’s which could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income we have entered into strategic partnerships with visa and mastercard to further expand our relationships in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with visa and mastercard credit and debit cards during the terms of these agreements visa and mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules that solely target paypal upon termination of the agreements paypal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments 

in addition in some jurisdictions governmental regulations have required payment card networks to reduce interchange fees any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the us or other markets including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers and our business 

we are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants the payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules from time to time the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules if such allegations are not resolved favorably they may result in significant fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement as a result we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged if we are unable to accept payment cards or are limited in our ability to do so our business would be adversely affected 

we and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines we are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk” including the sale of certain types of digital content for “high risk” merchants we must either prevent such merchants from using paypal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants although the amount of these fines has not been material to date additional fines in the future could become significant and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers which would adversely affect our business payment card network rules may also increase the cost of impose restrictions on or otherwise negatively impact the development of our retail pointofsale solutions which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption 

failure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transactions bad transactions and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services 

in the event that merchants do not fulfill their obligations to consumers or a merchants goods or services do not match the merchant’s description we may incur substantial losses as a result of claims from consumers we seek to recover such losses from the merchant but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay in addition in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use eg airline cruise or concert tickets custommade goods and subscriptions we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may be insufficient 

we also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase from customer fraud from erroneous transactions and as a result of customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in their bank accounts to satisfy payments in addition if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment which would harm our business we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against fraud particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings if these measures do not succeed our business could be harmed 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies including the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in nonus currencies our financial results are affected by the remeasurement of these nonus currencies into us dollars we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries while we regularly enter into transactions to hedge foreign currency risk for portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure it is 

impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially and adversely impact our financial results 

any factors that reduce crossborder trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business 

crossborder trade ie transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries is an important source of our revenue and profits crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market crossborder trade also represents our primary and in some cases our only presence in certain important markets 

crossborder trade is subject to and may be negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations in addition the interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer are often extremely complicated in the context of crossborder trade changes to or the interpretation andor application of laws and regulations applicable to crossborder trade could impose additional requirements and restrictions impose conflicting obligations and increase the costs associated with crossborder trade any factors that increase the costs of crossborder trade for us or our customers or that restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business 

the united kingdom’s departure from the eu could adversely affect us 

the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum in june 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the eu “brexit” in march 2017 the uk invoked article 50 of the treaty on european union which triggered a twoyear period with extension subject to unanimous consent by the other eu member states during which the uk government will negotiate its withdrawal agreement with the eu brexit could adversely affect uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro which in turn could adversely affect our customers and companies with which we do business particularly in the uk in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and see national laws and regulations in the uk diverge from eu laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate in particular depending on the terms of brexit we may face new regulatory costs and challenges including the following 

 

any of the effects of brexit described above and others that we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight as well as extensive complex overlapping and frequently changing rules regulations and legal interpretations 

our business is subject to laws rules regulations policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate including but not limited to those governing banking credit deposit taking crossborder and domestic money transmission foreign exchange privacy data protection cybersecurity banking secrecy payment services including payment processing and settlement services consumer protection economic and trade sanctions antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive complex frequently changing and increasing in number and may impose overlapping andor conflicting requirements or obligations 

financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business 

our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business 

as we expand and localize our international activities we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate in addition because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws laws regulating the internet mobile and related technologies outside of the us often impose different more specific or even conflicting obligations on us as well as broader liability for example certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” or us antimoney laundering or counterterrorist financing regulations 

any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws regulations or orders of any governmental authority including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws regulations or orders including those discussed in this risk factor may subject us to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions result in additional compliance and licensure requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operations and force us to change our business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements any of the foregoing could individually or in the aggregate damage our brands and business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the complexity of us federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

payments regulation 

in the us paypal inc has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in the states where it is required as well as in the district of columbia the us virgin islands and puerto rico these licenses include not only the paypal branded products and services in these states but also our braintree venmo xoom and tio branded products and services as a licensed money transmitter paypal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds reporting requirements bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies accordingly if we violate these laws or regulations we could be subject to liability andor additional restrictions forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states forced to change our business practices or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals which could impose substantial costs 

while we currently allow our customers with payment cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets including the us to also receive payments in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds these limitations may adversely affect our ability to grow our business in these markets 

we provide our services to customers in the eu through paypal europe our whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a credit institution in luxembourg accordingly paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization fund management corporate governance privacy data protection information security banking secrecy taxation sanctions or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks in addition eu laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the eu which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage moreover the countries that are eu members may each have different and potentially inconsistent domestic regulations implementing european directives including the eu payment services directive and the emoney directive which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage the revised payment services directive “psd2” entered into force in january 2016 and is in the process of being implemented into national legislation with certain requirements effective january 13 2018 the implementation of the psd2 may negatively affect our business psd2 seeks to enable new payment models whereby a newly formed category of regulated payment provider would be able to access bank and payment accounts including paypal accounts for the purposes of accessing account information or initiating a payment on behalf of a customer such access could subject us to data security and other legal and financial risks and could create new competitive forces and new types of competitors in the european payments market psd2 seeks to regulate more online platforms that handle payments for their sellers paypal merchants with affected business models which are not licensed or which do not benefit from exemptions or integrate a compliant marketplaces solution may not be able to offer paypal products in the future psd2 also imposes new standards for payment security and strong customer authentication that may make it more difficult and time consuming to carry out a paypal transaction which may adversely impact paypal’s customer value proposition and its european business 

finally if the business activities of paypal europe exceed certain thresholds or if the european central bank “ecb” determines that paypal europe is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of paypal europe is deemed subject to oversight by the ecb paypal europe could become directly regulated by the ecb in addition to the luxembourg regulator the commission de surveillance du secteur financier the cssf as its national supervisor which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs 

in australia we serve our customers through paypal australia pty ltd “paypal australia” which is licensed by the australian securities and investments commission as a provider of a noncash payment product and by the australian prudential regulation authority as a purchased payment facility provider which is a type of authorized depository institution accordingly paypal australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capital requirements privacy corporate governance or other requirements imposed on australian depository institutions 

in hong kong we serve our customers through paypal hong kong limited “paypal hong kong” which is licensed by the hong kong monetary authority as an issuer of stored value facility “svf licensee” accordingly paypal hong kong is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the reporting antimoney laundering capital requirements privacy corporate governance risk management float management andor any other requirements imposed on svf licensees 

in many of the other markets in which we do business we serve our customers through paypal pte ltd our whollyowned subsidiary based in singapore paypal pte ltd is supervised by the monetary authority of singapore and designated as a holder of a stored value facility but does not hold a remittance license as a result paypal pte ltd is not able to offer outbound remittance payments including donations to charities from singapore and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in singapore in many of the markets other than singapore served by paypal pte ltd it is unclear and uncertain whether our singaporebased service is subject only to singapore law or if it is subject to the application of local laws whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service bank financial institution or otherwise 

we are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses certifications and approvals in addition there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses certifications and approvals and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses these factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing our products or services in a given market 

in many countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider bank financial institution or otherwise in such markets we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit us from doing business in a country such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services require significant and costly operational changes impose restrictions limitations or additional requirements on our business or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market 

consumer protection 

the financial services sector is subject to significant regulation and we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate in the us we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities including the electronic fund transfer act “efta” and regulation e as implemented by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” these regulations require us to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services follow specified error resolution procedures and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer among other requirements additionally technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to 1000 in individual cases or up to 500000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases we are subject to and have paid amounts in settlement of lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the efta and regulation e or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices eg that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts 

in october 2016 the cfpb issued a final rule on prepaid accounts the rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain accounts that are capable of being loaded with funds and whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple 

unaffiliated merchants at atms andor for persontoperson transfers including certain digital wallets the rule’s requirements include the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account the extension of regulation e liability limits and errorresolution requirements to all prepaid accounts the application of regulation z credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the cfpb and their publication to the general public in april 2017 the cfpb delayed the effective date of the final rule on prepaid accounts to april 1 2018 and indicated that it would review among other issues the linking of credit cards to digital wallets that are capable of storing funds in june 2017 the cfpb released proposed changes to its final rule and in january 2018 the cfpb issued its final rulewith an effective date of april 1 2019 we are evaluating the final rule and its requirements implementation of the rule could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices and the design of certain products allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business 

in may 2015 we entered into a stipulated final judgment and consent order “consent order” with the cfpb in which we settled regulatory claims arising from paypal credit practices between 2011 and 2015 the consent order included obligations on paypal to pay 15 million in redress to consumers and a 10 million civil monetary penalty and required paypal to make various changes to paypal credit disclosures and related business practices we continue to cooperate and engage with the cfpb and work to ensure compliance with the consent order which may result in us incurring additional costs 

paypal europe principally offers its services in eu countries through a “passport” notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other eu member states pursuant to eu regulation regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its or the paypal groups activities in the local country directly or through a branch office these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of or delay our plans to expand our business in eu countries 

economic and trade sanctions 

we are required to comply with us economic and trade sanctions administered by ofac we have selfreported to ofac certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of us economic and trade sanctions in march 2015 we reached a settlement with ofac regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013 prior to the implementation of our realtime transaction scanning program subsequently we have selfreported additional transactions as possible violations and we have received new subpoenas from ofac seeking additional information about certain of these transactions such selfreported transactions could result in claims or actions against us including litigation injunctions damage awards fines or penalties or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss require significant management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business furthermore compliance with economic and trade sanctions in force in one jurisdiction may conflict with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate and can expose us to the risk of fines sanctions and penalties 

antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing 

we are subject to various antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit among other things our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities us and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions many countries in which we operate also have antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations and we have been and will continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response regulators regularly reexamine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance in the eu the implementation of the fourth antimoney laundering directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds commonly known as the revised wire transfer regulation are expected to make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage lead to increased friction for customers and result in a decrease in business as of december 2017 paypal europe’s home state luxembourg had not yet implemented all of the provisions of the fourth antimoney laundering directive and there is uncertainty as to the exact requirements with which paypal europe will be required to comply penalties for noncompliance with the fourth antimoney laundering directive could include fines of up to 10 of paypal europe’s total annual turnover eu institutions are also proposing changes to the fourth antimoney laundering directive which could be even more stringent 

privacy and protection of user data 

we are subject to a number of laws rules directives and regulations which we refer to as “privacy laws” relating to the collection use retention security processing and transfer which we refer to as “process” of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees which we refer to as “personal data” in the countries where we operate much of the personal data that we process especially financial information is regulated by multiple privacy laws and in some cases the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between or among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relationships 

regulatory scrutiny of privacy data protection and the collection use and sharing of data is increasing around the world there is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment relating to privacy and data protection laws which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy and data protectionrelated laws may expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business and reputation in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers 

paypal relies on a variety of compliance methods to transfer personal data of eu citizens to the us including reliance on binding corporate rules “bcrs” for internal transfers of certain types of personal data and standard contractual clauses “sccs” as approved by the european commission for transfers to and from third parties paypal must also ensure that third parties processing personal data of paypal’s eu customers andor employees outside of the eu have compliant transfer mechanisms in october 2015 the european court of justice invalidated useu safe harbor framework clauses that were previously relied upon by some paypal vendors to lawfully transfer personal data of eu citizens to us companies and paypal entered into sccs with those third parties who had previously relied on the useu safe harbor framework in july 2016 the us and eu authorities agreed on a replacement for safe harbor known as “privacy shield” both the privacy shield framework and sccs are facing legal challenges in the european justice system to the extent that the privacy shield or sccs are invalidated paypal’s ability to process eu personal data with third parties outside of the eu could be jeopardized 

in 2016 the eu adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single european economic area privacy regulation the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which comes into effect in may 2018 the proposed eu data protection regime expands the scope of the eu data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of eu residents imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4 of worldwide turnover and €20 million and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data although the gdpr will apply across the eu without a need for local implementing legislation local data protection authorities “dpas” will still have the ability to interpret the gdpr through socalled opening clauses which permit regionspecific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a countrybycountry basis we are evaluating the rule and its requirements implementation of the gdpr could require us to change our business practices and increase the costs and complexity of compliance 

paypal also faces additional potential challenges from local dpas because paypal europe is headquartered in luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction we have relied on the “onestopshop” concept under which luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the eu however a 2015 european court of justice ruling weltimmo affecting companies that do business in the eu potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various eu member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws that are different than and may conflict with luxembourg privacy laws 

in addition because of the large number of text messages emails phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes communicationrelated privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines for example under the telephone consumer protection act “tcpa” in the us plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of 500 per violation whichever is greater and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations we have been and may continue to be subject to lawsuits including classaction lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the tcpa these lawsuits seek damages including statutory damages and injunctive relief among other remedies given the large number of communications we send to our customers a determination that there have been violations of the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business 

data protection privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public media regulatory and legislative concern we post on our websites and applications our privacy policies and practices regarding the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders or with privacy data protection information security or consumer protectionrelated laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches which themselves may result in a violation of privacy laws 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the us and abroad as part of our currency hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our credit facilities we regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk despite these efforts we may be exposed to the risk of default by or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of these counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default deterioration or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

paypal is not a bank or licensed lender in the us and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business 

as paypal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state in the us we rely on a thirdparty chartered financial institution to issue the paypal credit consumer product in the us and different chartered financial institutions to issue the paypal working capital product and other business loan products in the us these chartered financial institutions are state chartered industrial banks any termination or interruption in a partner bank’s ability to lend could result in us being unable or unwilling to offer our consumer and business loan products which could materially and adversely affect our ability to issue our loan products in the us and our business in the event of a partner bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend we may need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or lending licenses we may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a costly timeconsuming and uncertain process subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements which could be burdensome increase our costs and require us to change our business practices in addition as a service provider to these bank partners which are federally supervised us financial institutions we are subject from time to time to examination by their federal banking regulators 

a case decided in the us court of appeals for the second circuit madden v midland funding llc  786 f3d 246 2d cir 2015 resulted in some uncertainty as to whether nonbank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans although the decision specifically addressed preemption under the national bank act this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions including fdicinsured state chartered industrial banks like those that we rely on to issue our loan products in the us after the madden  decision there continue to be a number of us state and federal court legal actions challenging the viability of business models where a nonbank entity relies on a third party chartered financial institution in connection with the issuance of credit products while we believe the manner in which we offer our credit products can be distinguished from madden  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of any potential litigation which could materially and adversely impact our ability to issue our loan products in the us and our business 

on november 16 2017 we announced an arrangement under which synchrony bank will acquire the us consumer credit receivables portfolio held by us and certain of our affiliates which totaled approximately 64 billion in receivables as of december 31 2017 the purchase price is subject to a postclosing trueup and certain adjustments the transaction is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2018 subject to certain closing conditions the transaction may not close within the expected timeframe or at all even if the transaction is consummated it may take us longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results under our expanded program agreement with synchrony bank at the closing of the 

consumer credit receivables portfolio sale synchrony bank will become the exclusive issuer of the paypal credit online consumer financing program in the us for a 10year term and we retain an option to designate a purchaser of the portfolio at the end of that term our increased reliance on synchrony will subject us to risks in the nature of those discussed in this “risk factors” section under the caption we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

our credit products expose us to additional risks 

we offer our paypal credit consumer product and paypal working capital and other business loan products to a wide range of consumers and merchants in various markets and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of related risk the credit decisioning process for our paypal credit consumer product uses proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history with paypal as well as their credit scores similarly proprietary risk models and other indicators are applied to assess merchants who wish to use our business loan products to help predict their ability to repay these risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to factors such as inaccurate assumptions including assumptions related to the particular consumer or merchant market conditions economic environment or limited transaction history or other data among other factors the accuracy of these risk models and the ability to manage credit risk related to our credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory requirements competitors’ actions changes in consumer behavior changes in the economic environment and other factors our international expansion of our credit product offerings also exposes us to additional risks including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “our international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business” 

like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer and merchant credit we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations creating the risk of potential chargeoffs the nonpayment rate among account holders may increase due to among other things changes to underwriting standards worsening economic conditions such as a recession or government austerity programs increases in prevailing interest rates and high unemployment rates account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans 

we currently purchase receivables related to our credit products in the us if we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a costeffective manner or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes our business could be harmed 

our business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business our customers and companies with which we do business our business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters fire power shortages earthquakes floods nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond our control such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers in the event of a natural disaster we could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume or maintain operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate 

our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions and consumers if they do not receive the item ordered or if the item received is significantly different from its description in 2015 we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services in addition consumers who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer usually a bank which in turn will seek recovery from us the risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers sellers and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements or changes that we decide to implement such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs upon paypal becoming an independent publicly traded company in july 2015 we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on ebay and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased increases in our loss rate including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs could harm our business 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business 

our international operations have generated approximately onehalf of our net revenues in recent years there are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic ie incountry and crossborder basis including 

 

violations of the complex foreign and us laws rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion may increase our costs of doing business internationally and could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts a low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our investment income and our net income in addition fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

we have entered into a revolving credit facility and a 364day delayeddraw term loan credit facility we have borrowed under these credit facilities from time to time and any borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at a floating rate exposing us to interest rate fluctuations 

use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business 

our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses including money laundering terrorist financing illegal online gambling fraudulent sales of goods or services illegal sales of prescription medications or controlled substances piracy of software movies music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods in particular digital goods bank fraud child pornography trafficking prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products online securities fraud or to facilitate other illegal activity any use of our payment system for illegal or improper uses could subject us to claims individual and class action lawsuits and government and regulatory investigations inquiries or requests that could result in liability and reputational harm for us moreover certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods resulting in liability for us changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and government authorities may consider additional paymentsrelated proposals from time to time owners of intellectual property rights or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions including paypal that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing or allegedly infringing items any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm and any resulting liabilities loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business 

our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business 

we hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers including deposits in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services in certain jurisdictions where we operate we are required to hold eligible liquid assets as defined by the relevant regulators in each jurisdiction equal to at least 100  of the aggregate amount of all customer balances our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds and comply with applicable liquid asset requirements requires a high level of internal controls as our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls paypal europe with the permission of the cssf utilizes certain european customer balances held by our luxembourg banking subsidiary to fund credit balances relating to our customers our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements could result in reputational harm lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines which could materially harm our business 

we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws 

we are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under us and foreign laws and regulations including antitrust and competition laws an increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us individual states other countries or the european commission or otherwise constitute unfair competition an increasing number of governments are regulating and increasing their scrutiny of competition law activities our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation some regulators particularly those outside of the us may perceive that our products and services are used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive any claims or investigations even if without merit may be very expensive to defend or respond to involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in reputational harm significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices 

we are subject to patent litigation 

we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents at any given time we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes we expect that we will continue to be subject to patent infringement claims because among other reasons 

 

such claims may be brought directly against us or against our customers whom we may indemnify because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter we believe that many of the claims against us and other technology companies have been and continue to be initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims in 

addition we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries patent claims whether meritorious or not are timeconsuming and costly to defend and resolve and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings or cease conducting certain operations which would harm our business 

we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business 

effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our products and services we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights 

although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business 

as the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others the ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and regardless of the outcome any such claim with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business and require us to among other things redesign or stop providing our products or services pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters may harm our business 

we are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory disputes and government inquiries 

we are regularly subject to claims individual and class action lawsuits government and regulatory investigations inquiries or requests and other proceedings alleging violations of laws rules and regulations with respect to competition antitrust intellectual property privacy data protection information security antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing sanctions anticorruption consumer protection fraud accessibility securities tax labor and employment commercial disputes services charitable fundraising contract disputes escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property and other matters in particular our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation as discussed above the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our business has expanded in scale scope and geographic reach and our products and services have increased in complexity in addition the laws rules and regulations affecting our business including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce payments services and credit are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations 

the scope outcome and impact of claims lawsuits government investigations and proceedings to which we are subject cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources reputational damage and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex factintensive process that involves a high degree of judgment resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy 

judgments fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings any of which could materially and adversely affect our business these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders that prevent us from offering certain products or services require us to change our business practices in costly ways or develop noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

while certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions including the class action waiver provisions in the future or in any given case legislative administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of predispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits including additional consumer class action litigation and significantly limit our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation 

changes in us tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow results of operations and financial conditions 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” the tax act makes changes to the corporate tax rate businessrelated deductions and taxation of foreign earnings among others that will generally be effective for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 these changes could have a material adverse impact on the value of our us deferred tax assets result in significant onetime charges in the current or future taxable years and increase our future us tax expense we are continuing to evaluate the tax act and its requirements as well as its application to our business and its impact on our effective tax rate at this stage it is unclear how many us states will incorporate these federal law changes or portions thereof into their tax codes the implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with and benefit from the tax act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient 

in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of losses in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items 

various levels of government such as us federal and state legislatures and international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” and the eu are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate 

we and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and recordkeeping obligations 

a number of us states the us federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or recordkeeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance additionally a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed to be the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes we have modified our systems to meet known requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements which may negatively impact our customer experience and increase operational costs any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and recordkeeping obligations could 

result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions adversely impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions and harm our business 

acquisitions joint ventures strategic investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business 

acquisitions joint ventures strategic investments and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses technologies services products and other assets as well as joint ventures strategic investments and commercial and strategic partnerships these transactions may involve significant challenges and risks including 

 

at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions any of which could individually or in the aggregate be material to our financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt and increased interest expense recognize liabilities and record amortization expenses related to intangible assets or writeoffs of goodwill or intangibles which could dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders and adversely affect our results of operations and the interests of holders of our indebtedness as applicable 

joint ventures and minority investment inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other 

actions or omissions of the joint venture partners controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control them and who may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand 

there are risks associated with our indebtedness 

we have incurred indebtedness and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this “risk factors” section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully in addition changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on outstanding or future debt these risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business including the following 

 

because we rely on third parties to provide services to us and our customers and to facilitate certain of our business activities we face increased operational risk these third parties may be subject to financial legal regulatory labor or other issues such as service terminations disruptions or interruptions that prevent them from providing services to us or our customers moreover these third parties are themselves subject to the risks discussed earlier in the risk factors section under the caption our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches in addition these third parties may breach their agreements with us disagree with our interpretation of contract terms or applicable laws and regulations refuse to continue or renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all fail or refuse to process transactions adequately take actions that degrade the functionality of our services impose additional costs or requirements on us or give preferential treatment to competitive services there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms or at all if any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all if third parties we rely on do not adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities we may be subject to business disruptions losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies customer dissatisfaction reputational damage legal or regulatory proceedings or other adverse consequences which could harm our business 

our developer platforms which are open to merchants and thirdparty developers subject us to additional risks 

we provide thirdparty developers with access to application programming interfaces software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use with a particular focus on mobile applications there can be no assurance that merchants or thirdparty developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all and a number of factors could cause such thirdparty developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms in addition our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions it is possible that merchants and thirdparty developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations which could harm our business 

our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks 

we have announced several retail point of sale solutions which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to or otherwise communicating with a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale we have entered into strategic partnerships with major payment card networks to further expand our relationship in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing these companies credit and debit cards those 

agreements provide us with access to each of these partners tokenization services in the us for instore pointofsale paypal transactions which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process as we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale we will face additional risks including 

 

unless we are able to successfully manage these risks including driving adoption of and significant volume through our retail point of sale solutions over time our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on key personnel because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of key personnel could harm our business 

our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of key personnel including our executive team and other highly skilled employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate such personnel competition for key personnel is intense especially in the san francisco bay area where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high and we may be unable to successfully attract integrate or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel in making employment decisions particularly in the technology and payments industries job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment and fluctuations in our stock price or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies may make it more difficult to attract retain and motivate employees we may be limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies in addition we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified key personnel could harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services 

companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them including claims alleging defamation libel harassment hate speech breach of contract invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement among other things the laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges we are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customerprovided content on our products and services particularly in jurisdictions outside the us where the applicable laws are unsettled if we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings which could harm our business 

risks related to the separation from ebay 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” ebay paypal and ebay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ebay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

on july 17 2015 we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by ebay inc of 100 of our outstanding common stock to ebay’s stockholders which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution” ebay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related 

transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code the opinion was based on and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of ebay and of us including those relating to the past and future conduct of ebay and of us if any of these representations statements or undertakings were or became inaccurate or incomplete or if ebay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution together with certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if the irs determines that any of these representations assumptions or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or any court and there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion the irs did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is taxfree 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code in general ebay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the paypal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value ebay stockholders who received paypal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities 

there are risks associated with certain agreements that we entered into with ebay at the separation 

in connection with the separation we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with ebay as well as various other agreements including an operating agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a data sharing addendum and a product development agreement the separation agreement the tax matters agreement the employee matters agreement and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities including by means of licensing between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include associated indemnification obligations the operating agreement the data sharing addendum and the product development agreement establish certain commercial relationships between ebay and us related to payment processing credit and data sharing if we or ebay is unable to satisfy its performance payment or indemnification obligations under these agreements we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to ebay 

our relationship with ebay is governed in part by an operating agreement entered into at separation with a term of five years this operating agreement defines a number of important elements of our commercial relationship with ebay as well as certain obligations and limitations that limit paypal’s provision of services to certain competitive platform operators of ebay as specified in the operating agreement ebay remains a significant source of our revenues and operating income if our operating agreement with ebay expires or is terminated prior to its expiration or if there is a significant change in our relationship with ebay including if ebay becomes a merchant of record eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers ebay customers alternative payment options it could lead to customer dissatisfaction reputational damage and other adverse consequences and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 

risks related to our common stock

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 

we have also elected not to be governed by section 203 of the dgcl which provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation however contains a provision that generally mirrors section 203 of the dgcl except that it provides for a 20 threshold instead of the 15 provided for by the dgcl these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor 

these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

separation from ebay inc 

on september 30 2014 ebay inc “ebay” announced its intent to separate its payments business into an independent publicly traded company to accomplish this separation in january 2015 ebay incorporated paypal holdings inc “paypal holdings” which is now the parent of paypal inc and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with paypal inc in june 2015 the board of directors of ebay approved the separation the “separation” of ebays payments business through the distribution the “distribution” of 100 of the outstanding common stock of paypal holdings to ebays stockholders paypal holdings registration statement on form 10 as amended was declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission on june 29 2015 on july 17 2015 the “distribution date” paypal holdings became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by ebay of 100 of the outstanding common stock of paypal holdings to ebay stockholders each ebay stockholder of record as of the close of business on july 8 2015 received one share of paypal holdings common stock for every share of ebay common stock held on the record date approximately 12 billion shares of paypal holdings common stock were distributed on july 17 2015 to ebay stockholders paypal holdings common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “pypl” on the nasdaq stock market on july 20 2015 

prior to the separation ebay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of ebays payments business to paypal holdings which was completed in june 2015 the “capitalization” the consolidated financial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a standalone basis and were derived from ebays consolidated financial statements and accounting records the consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position results of operations comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of ebay prior to the capitalization following the capitalization our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of paypal holdings and its whollyowned subsidiaries the consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate standalone entity during the periods presented nor are they indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows may be in the future for additional information see “note 1—overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k

business environment 

we are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide our vision is to democratize financial services as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for all people not just the affluent our goal is to increase our relevance for consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world anytime on any platform and using any device our combined payment solutions including our paypal paypal credit braintree venmo xoom and paydiant products compose our proprietary payments platform 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation noncompliance with laws and regulations increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

the united kingdom uk held a referendum in june 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the european union eu “brexit” in march 2017 the uk government gave formal notice of its intention to leave the eu and started the process of negotiating the future terms of the uks relationship with the eu brexit could adversely affect uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro 

we have foreign exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency rate movements in 2017  2016  and 2015  net revenues generated from our uk operations constituted 11  12  and 13  respectively of total net revenues in 2017  2016  and 2015  net revenues generated from the eu excluding the uk constituted approximately 20  of total net revenues for additional information on how brexit could affect our business see “item 1a risk factors” under the caption—“the united kingdom’s departure from the eu could adversely affect us” 

information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased in recent years although we are not aware of any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches on our payments platform we are not immune to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future see “item 1a risk factors” under the caption—“our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches”

total operating expenses increased   17 billion  or 18  in 2017  and 15 billion  or 19  in 2016  the increase  in 2017  was due primarily to an increase  in transaction expense sales and marketing general and administrative product development and restructuring and other charges operating expenses related to tio and swift collectively contributed one percentage point to the 2017 growth rate the increase in total operating expense in 2016  was due primarily to an increase in transaction expense and transaction and loan losses which increase with tpv and higher customer support and operations general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization incurred to operate as an independent public company partially offset by a decrease in restructuring expense xoom operating expenses contributed three percentage points to the 2016 growth rate

impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar in 2017  2016  and 2015  we generated approximately 46  47  and 50  of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the united states respectively during each of these periods uk was the only country other than the united states where we generated more than 10 of total net revenues in in 2017  2016  and 2015  net revenues generated from the eu excluding the uk constituted approximately 20  of total net revenues because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods including during the periods presented we are subject to the risks of doing business in countries outside of the us as discussed under “item 1a risk factors—risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition” 

we calculate the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges designed to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings 

in the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  the yearoveryear foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar had the following impact on our reported results 

while we enter into foreign exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure 

additionally in connection with our services in multiple currencies we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates twice per day and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities 

financial results 

net revenues 

revenue description 

we earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our payments platform and from other value added services our revenues are classified into the following two categories 

  

 our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following 

  

 net revenues analysis 

the components of our net revenue for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



transaction revenues 

transaction revenues increased by 19 billion  or 20  in 2017  compared to 2016  and by 14 billion  or 17  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase in transaction revenues in 2017  and 2016 was due primarily to the growth in tpv mainly from our paypal and braintree products and in the number of payment transactions both of which were due primarily to an increase in our active customer accounts and increased engagement from our customers measured by payment transactions per active account xoom transaction revenues contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate net gains from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2017  were 17 million  compared to 119 million  in 2016  refer to “note 8—derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program 

the following table provides a summary of our active customer accounts number of payment transactions tpv and related metrics 



all amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions except as otherwise noted as a result certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided 

1  an active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products in the past 12 months 

2  payment transactions are the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products 

3  number of payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period 

4  tpv is the value of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products 

 not meaningful 

transaction revenues grew more slowly than both tpv and number of payment transactions in 2017  due primarily to a higher proportion of persontoperson “p2p” transactions primarily from our paypal and venmo products from which we earn lower rates and foreign exchange hedging losses the percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth in tpv and payment transactions in 2016  primarily due to a higher proportion of p2p transactions including our venmo products for which we earn lower rates and a higher portion of tpv generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volume the impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2017  or 2016  

other value added services 

net revenues from other value added services increased by 340 million  or 25  in 2017  compared to 2016  and by 232 million  or 21  in 2016  compared to 2015  growth in net revenues from other valueadded services in 2017 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our paypal credit loans receivable portfolio swift revenues contributed approximately three percentage points to the 2017 growth rate the total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance including loans and receivables held for sale as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  was 78 billion  and 57 billion  respectively reflecting a yearoveryear increase of 37  

in november 2017 we reached an agreement to sell our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank which we believe will enable us at closing to free up balance sheet capacity and cash flow for other uses and mitigate balance sheet risk historically this portfolio was reported as outstanding principal balances net of any participation interest sold and prorata allowances including unamortized deferred origination costs and estimated collectible interest and fees upon approval of the decision to sell these receivables from our board of directors the portfolio was reclassified as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value due to the designation as held for sale the associated allowance for this portfolio was reversed resulting in an increase of approximately 39 million in revenue from other value added services this transaction will be accounted for as a sale and the receivables will no longer be reported in our consolidated financial statements 

following the closing of this transaction which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018 synchrony bank will become the exclusive issuer of the paypal credit online consumer financing program in the us and we will no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program other than charged off receivables in addition we will earn a profit share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by synchrony bank 

growth in net revenues from other value added services in 2016 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our paypal credit loans receivable portfolio the total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 was 57 billion  and 44 billion respectively reflecting a yearoveryear increase of 29 

in the third quarter of 2015 we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with synchrony bank as a result of the amendment we recognized 78 million of revenue under the agreement during 2015 in addition as part of the amended agreement our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with synchrony bank was terminated the amended credit program agreement will upon closing of the sale of our us consumer credit receivable portfolio to synchrony bank be superseded by the new program agreement signed in november 2017 

in the second quarter of 2015 we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in certain consumer loans and interest receivables related to our paypal credit product with a gross book value of approximately 708 million in connection with its purchase of our us consumer credit receivable portfolio synchrony bank has also agreed to acquire the participation interests held by the investors 

operating expenses 

beginning with the first quarter of 2016 we reclassified certain operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to better align our external and internal financial reporting these classification changes relate primarily to real estate and information technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among customer support and operations expense sales and marketing expense and product development expense our management no longer allocates these operating expenses for internal financial reporting purposes or general management of the business and has therefore discontinued this allocation for external financial reporting purposes as a result starting with the first quarter of 2016 these operating expenses were reported as part of general and administrative expenses these changes have no impact on the previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods including total operating expenses financial position or cash flows for any periods presented and do not eliminate any of the costs allocated to us by ebay for any periods prior to the separation prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation see “note 1—overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of operating expenses to our previously reported consolidated statement of income growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts 

the following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each 



1 transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by tpv 

2 transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by tpv 

 not meaningful 

transaction expense 

transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment these costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our paypal credit funding option we refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix” the cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a paypal account balance or paypal credit as we expand the availability of alternative 

funding sources to our customers a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate the cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the us than in the us 

transaction expense increased  by 11 billion  or 32  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased by 736 million or 28 in 2016 compared to 2015 the increase in transaction expense in 2017  was primarily attributable to an increase in tpv of 27  and higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions the increase in transaction expense in 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in tpv of 26 

the increase in our transaction expense rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to higher assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions our transaction expense rate in 2016  increased compared to 2015 due primarily to changes in funding mix for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  approximately 2  of tpv was funded with paypal credit for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  approximately 44  45  and 45  of tpv respectively was generated outside of the us interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable included in transaction expense was not material for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

transaction and loan losses 

transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud and chargebacks loan losses include the losses associated with our consumer and merchant loans receivable portfolio except loans and interest receivable held for sale our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors including tpv macroeconomic conditions changes to our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchant sellers additionally prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts from ebay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible ebay purchases made with paypal these costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with ebays customer protection programs that we administered and funded on behalf of ebay which were included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses recoveries associated with protection losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases during the year ended december 31 2015 were 27 million following the distribution we no longer administer ebays customer protection programs or recover amounts from ebay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases instead we and ebay each independently administer our own customer protection programs further our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on ebay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution 

the components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were as follows 



transaction and loan losses decreased by 77 million  or 7  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased by 279 million  or 34  in 2016  compared to 2015  

transaction losses increased  by 168 million  or 26  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased  by 144 million  or 28  in 2016  compared to 2015  due primarily to higher tpv our transaction loss rate calculated by dividing transaction loss by tpv in 2017  and 2016  was roughly flat compared to 2016  and 2015  respectively the growth in transaction losses in 2016 was higher than the growth in tpv in 2016 due primarily to lower incremental costs in 2015 associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution 

loan losses decreased  by 245 million  or 57  in 2017  compared to 2016  and increased  by 135 million  or 45  in 2016  compared to 2015  the decrease in loan losses in 2017 was due primarily to the reversal of approximately 283 million of allowance on loans receivable due to the designation of our us consumer credit portfolio as held for sale the increase in loan losses in 2016 was due primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year and additional reserves recorded in that period due to increases to forecasted principal balance delinquency rates the total consumer loans receivable balance as of december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was 326 million 51 billion  and 40 billion respectively reflecting yearoveryear decrease of 94 from 2016 to 2017 and an increase of 28 from 2015 to 2016 the decrease in consumer loan receivables in 2017 was due to designation of us consumer credit portfolio as held for sale the increase in consumer loans receivable in 2016 was due to the growth in the portfolio of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers who chose paypal credit as a funding option and an increase in working capital advances to selected merchant sellers 

the following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our pool of consumer loans and interest receivable balances 

  



1  amounts as of december 31 2017 represent loans and interest receivables due from consumer accounts not classified as held for sale and amounts as of december 31 2016 represent total consumer loans and interest receivables including us consumer receivables because they were not classified as held for sale as of that date 

2  represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer 

3  net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year 

through our paypal working capital product we offer credit products to certain small and mediumsized merchants that are existing users of our other payment services total paypal working capital loans advances and fees receivable outstanding as of december 31 2017  net of participation interest sold were 703 million  total paypal working capital loans advances and fees receivable outstanding as of december 31 2016  were 558 million  reflecting a yearoveryear increase of 26  due to the increase in the availability of our credit products domestically and internationally 

to assess a merchant who requests a paypal working capital loan or advance we use among other indicators an internally developed risk model that we refer to as our paypal working capital risk model “prm” as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchants ability to repay the amount of the loan or advance and fixed fee the prm uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchants ability to repay a working capital loan or advance primary drivers of the model include the merchants annual payment volume and payment processing history with paypal prior repayment history with the paypal working capital product and other measures merchants are assigned a prm credit score within the range of 350  to 750  we generally expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital loan or advance will have prm scores greater than 525  we generally consider scores above 610  to be very good and to pose less credit risk for all outstanding working capital loans and advances we assess a participating merchant’s prm score on a recurring basis at december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  the weighted average prm score related to our paypal working capital balances outstanding was 619  and 625  respectively 

the number of days our paypal working capital loans and advances receivables are past due is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed fee as compared to an original expected repayment period we generally calculate the repayment rate of the merchants estimated future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is expected to occur within 9  to 12  months from the date of the loan or advance on a monthly basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable as such actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes we monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected repayment period 

as of december 31 2017 the total outstanding balance in our pool of swift merchant loans advances interest and fees receivable was 309 million we closely monitor credit quality for all merchant loans and advances so that we can evaluate quantify and manage our credit risk exposure to assess a merchant seeking a loan or an advance we use among other indicators a risk model developed internally which utilizes information obtained from multiple data sources both external and internal to predict the likelihood of timely and satisfactory repayment by the merchant of the loan or advance amount and the related interest or fixed fee drivers of the model include elements sourced from a consumer credit bureau report business credit bureau report prior repayment history with our products where available and other information obtained during the application process we use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions to adjust our internal model plan our collection practices and strategies and in the end our determination of our allowance for these loans and advances 

for swift business loan and advance products the determination of delinquency from current to 180 days past due is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan and fixed fee payment as compared to the original expected repayment period 

the following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant receivables

in the first quarter of 2017 management approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of the existing global workforce which was substantially completed by the end of 2017 we recognized 40 million  of restructuring expenses during the year ended december 31 2017  no restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016 in january 2015 at a regular meeting of ebay’s board of directors the “ebay board” the ebay board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce the reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses restructuring expenses were 48 million  in 2015

income tax expense 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act includes significant changes to the us corporate income tax system including a federal corporate rate reduction from 35 to 21 limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation creation of new minimum taxes such as the base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” and global intangible low taxed income “gilti” tax and the transition of us international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system which will result in a one time us tax liability on those earnings which have not previously been repatriated to the us the “transition tax” 

in connection with our initial analysis of the impact of the tax act we have recorded a provisional estimate of discrete net tax expense of 180 million in the period ended december 31 2017 this discrete expense consists of provisional estimates of 1468 million net expense for the transition tax payable in installments over eight years 1295 million net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings and 7 million net expense for remeasurement of our deferred tax assetsliabilities for the corporate rate reduction and changes in our valuation allowance 

we have not completed our accounting for the income tax effects of certain elements of the tax act including the new gilti and beat taxes due to the complexity of these new tax rules we are continuing to evaluate these provisions of the tax act and whether such taxes are recorded as a currentperiod expense when incurred or whether such amounts should be factored into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes as a result we have not included an estimate of the tax expensebenefit related to these items for the period ended december 31 2017 

our effective tax rate was 18  in 2017  14  in 2016  and 17  in 2015  the increase in our effective tax rate in 2017  was primarily due to discrete net tax expense recorded for us tax reform partially offset by the adoption of the new stockbased compensation accounting standard in 2017 the decrease in our effective tax rate during 2016  compared to 2015  was due primarily to favorable discrete tax adjustments during the year ended december 31 2016  and other separationrelated costs incurred during the year ended december 31 2015 see “note 17—income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information on our effective tax rate 

nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that create differences between the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” pursuant to the requirements of regulation sk the following portion of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” includes a reconciliation of certain nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures the presentation of nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 

we present nongaap financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparisons of our results between periods management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation 

we exclude the following items from nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share nongaap operating income nongaap operating margin and nongaap effective tax rate 



 the following table provides reconciliations of our consolidated nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015

in addition to the nongaap measures discussed above we also use free cash flow to assess our performance free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment and including investments in our payments platform which can then be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and repurchase stock a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period

programs are specific to individual customers merchants and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations in and changes or modifications to the programs including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report our transaction loss rates calculated by dividing transaction loss by tpv ranged between 018  and 019  of tpv historical trends may not be an indication of future results 

in january 2016 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to 2 billion of our common stock with no expiration from the date of authorization in april 2017 our board of directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to 5 billion of our common stock with no expiration from the date of authorization this program became effective upon completion of the january 2016 stock repurchase program the stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and subject to market conditions and other factors may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions block trades privately negotiated transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives however any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made moreover we may terminate our stock repurchase programs at any time without notice

our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating our financial performance and global credit market conditions as well as a broad range of other factors in addition our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see “item 1a risk factors—risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition” and “note 13—commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and investments cash expected to be generated from operations and our expected access to capital markets together with potential external funding through third party sources will be sufficient to fund our operating activities anticipated capital expenditures and paypal credit products for the foreseeable future depending on market conditions we may from time to time issue debt including in private or public offerings to fund our operating activities finance acquisitions repurchase shares under our share repurchase program or reduce our cost of capital

the net cash used in investing activities of 80 billion  in 2015  was due primarily to purchases of investments of 216 billion  acquisitions net of cash acquired of 12 billion  increases in our loan receivable portfolio net of collections originated through our paypal credit products of 819 million  and purchases of property and equipment of 722 million  these net cash outflows were offset in part by maturities and sales of investments of 161 billion  and net cash inflows relating to receivables from ebay of 575 million  

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock purchases of treasury stock tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards borrowings net of repayments under financing arrangements funds payable and amounts due to customers and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation for periods prior to 2017 for periods prior to the distribution it also includes contribution from ebay 

the net cash provided by financing activities of 41 billion  in 2017  was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 43 billion  and borrowings of 10 billion partially offset by repayment of a loan of 170 million assumed in connection with our acquisition of swift financial the repurchase of 10 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of 166 million  

  

the net cash provided by financing activities of 20 billion  in 2016  was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 30 billion  offset in part by the repurchase of 995 million  of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 

the net cash provided by financing activities of 47 billion  in 2015  was due primarily to a contribution of approximately 39 billion  of cash from ebay and increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 16 billion  offset in part by repayments of borrowings from ebay of 862 million  

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment 

free cash flow was 19 billion  in 2017  a decrease of 625 million  from 2016  the decrease in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to lower cash generated from operating activities of 627 million  which was impacted by the change in presentation from investing activities to operating activities of originations and collections on the us consumer credit portfolio subsequent to its designation as held for sale in november 2017 free cash flow generated during 2017  was used for repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase programs funding our credit portfolio acquisitions and general business purposes 

free cash flow was 25 billion  in 2016  an increase of 665 million  from 2015  the increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of 612 million  and lower purchases of property and equipment of 53 million  free cash flow generated during 2016  was used for funding our credit portfolio repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase program and general business purposes 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure see “nongaap financial information” for information on how we compute free cash flow and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

effect of exchange rates on cash 

the positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2017  of 36 million  was due to the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the euro currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on cash and cash equivalents in 2016 the negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015  of 44 million  was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the euro 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

future liquidity and obligations 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 264 billion  of unused credit was available to paypal credit account holders compared to 288 billion  of unused credit as of december 31 2016  while this amount represents the total unused credit available we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our paypal credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time in addition the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of our us paypal credit consumer products based on among other things account usage and customer creditworthiness when a consumer funds a purchase in the us using a paypal credit product issued by a chartered financial institution the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant we subsequently purchase the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and as a result of such purchase bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account we own the related receivable excluding participation interests sold and are responsible for all servicing functions related to the account upon the closing of the sale of our loans and interest receivables held for sale which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2018 we will no longer purchase receivables related to the us consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution 

we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes changes in our business needs contractual cancellation provisions fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2017  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations 



the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows 

 



from actual results under our existing leases unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early 

 as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits net the table above does not include 383 million of such noncurrent liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017  

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues no individual quarter in 2017  2016  or 2015  accounted for more than 30 of annual net revenue 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in “note 1 — overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates require regular review and adjustment 

transaction and loan losses 

transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud chargebacks and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors including total tpv macroeconomic conditions changes to our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our paypal credit products which include our paypal credit consumer product and merchant loans and advances consisting of paypal working capital and swift business loans and advances to merchant sellers 

we establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchantrelated chargebacks due to nondelivery of goods or services ach returns buyer protection program claims account takeovers and account overdrafts additions to the allowance in the form of provisions are reflected in transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statements of income the allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other actual data received the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances internal factors including experience with similar cases historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 

we also establish an allowance for loans receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our consumer loans receivable and merchant loans and advances increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our consolidated financial statements this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments in connection with the pending sale of our us consumer credit receivables portfolio to synchrony bank and the designation of that portfolio as held for sale in november 2017 we released corresponding allowances against those loans and interest receivable balances such allowances on any newly originated us consumer loan receivables from and after november 

2017 will not be established adjustments to the cost basis of this portfolio which are primarily driven by charge offs are recorded in restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of income for our consumer loan receivables not subject to the sale agreement with synchrony bank consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates “roll rates” roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our international consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to 180  days past the payment due date in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off for merchant loans and advances receivable that includes paypal working capital and swift business loan and advance products the allowance is primarily based on principal balances forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintagebased loss forecasting model 

the determination of delinquency from current to 180 days past due for principal balances related to merchant loans and advances is based on the current expected repayment period of the loan or advance and interest or fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period for paypal working capital product we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchants expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the loan or advance on a regular basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable as such actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes 

the allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off the allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintagebased loss forecasting model increases to the allowance for fees receivable is recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

we charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment due date we charge off the paypal working capital receivable when the updated repayment period is 180 days past the original expected repayment period and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days we also charge off the receivable when the updated repayment period is 360 days past the original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of bankruptcy loans receivable past the payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off with the portion of the reserve related to the interest receivable balance classified as a reduction of revenue for international consumers and recorded in restructuring and other charges for the us consumer receivables in our consolidated statement of income for swift business loan and advance products we charge off the receivable when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification of bankruptcy the provision for loan losses is recognized in transaction and loan losses chargeoffs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable 

determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date based on our results for the year ended december 31 2017  an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately 101 million  

accounting for income taxes 

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax laws and regulations our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the us through new provisions under the tax act such as the new gilti tax and beat or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a 

number of factors including our historical experience and short range and longrange business forecasts to the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized we record a valuation allowance 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

based on our results for the year ended december 31 2017  a onepercentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately 22 million  

loss contingencies 

we are currently involved in various claims legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims litigation or other violation and may revise our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 

revenue recognition 

application of the various accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 

we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist under the financial accounting standards board “fasb” guidance the evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the fasb guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment 

in performing these qualitative assessments we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts we must perform a quantitative impairment test 

under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties using present value techniques of estimated future cash flows or using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue or a similar performance measure 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing funding and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts we seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from changes in interest rates 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  approximately 39  and 25  respectively of our total cash and investment portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents   the assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits time deposits us and foreign government and agency securities and corporate debt securities we classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers we seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in the jurisdictions where we operate equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances we do not pay interest on amounts due to customers 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we entered into an unsecured 30 billion  364  day delayeddraw term loan credit facility which is available in up to three borrowings 2017 credit agreement in the third quarter of 2015 we entered into a 20 billion  senior unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020 2015 credit agreement the company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world aggregating to approximately 250 million  

borrowings under the 2017 credit agreement and 2015 credit agreement if any bear interest at floating rates as a result we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings as of december 31 2017  10 billion  was outstanding under the 2017 credit agreement at an interest rate of 278  one month libor plus a margin of 1125  accordingly at december 31 2017  20 billion  of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the 2017 credit agreement subject to customary conditions to borrowing as of december 31 2017  no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the 2015 credit agreement or uncommitted facilities 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact  on our financial assets or liabilities at december 31 2017  and 2016  

foreign currency risk 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services our cash flows results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities we are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

we have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts please see “note 8—derivative instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we use foreign exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts if any is recorded immediately in earnings 

we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 20 at december 31 2017  and 2016  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 536 million  and 341 million  lower respectively if the us dollar strengthened by 20 at december 31 2017  and 2016  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 536 million  and 341 million  higher respectively 

we have an additional foreign exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts 

adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 243 million  and 160 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively without considering the offsetting effect of hedging foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2017  would have positively  impacted income before income taxes by approximately 211 million  resulting in a net negative  impact of approximately 32 million  foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2016  would have positively  impacted income before income taxes by approximately 128 million  resulting in a net negative  impact of approximately 32 million  these reasonably possible adverse changes in currency exchange rates of 20 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term 

equity price risk 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  our cost method investments totaled 88 million  and 50 million  respectively which represented approximately 1 of our total cash and investment portfolio and were primarily related to cost method investments in privately held companies as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we did not hold any marketable equity instruments we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent sales and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data

paypal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices our braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers that offer their services primarily through mobile applications through a single braintree integration a merchant can begin

protecting merchants and consumers 

protecting merchants and consumers on our payments platform from financial and data loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry and growing our business sustainably the risk to merchants and consumers and their payments partners from fraudulent activities such as account takeover identity theft and counterparty malicious activities is growing we provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on most purchase transactions completed through our payments platform except for transactions using our gateway and paydiant products we believe that these programs which protect both merchants and consumers from financial and data loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty nonperformance are generally much broader than similar protections provided by other participants in the payments industry many payments providers do not offer merchant protection in general and those that do so generally do not provide protection for online or card not present transactions as a result merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they used our payments services we also provide consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accept claims for 180 days post transaction in the markets that we serve we believe that this protection is generally consistent with or better than that offered by other payments providers we believe that as a result of these programs consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as described and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer 

our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our proprietary endtoend payments platform our ability to leverage the data we collect on both sides of the transactions from buyers and sellers or from senders and receivers of money on our twosided network we believe mobile devices will play an important part in the future of commerce including by creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer for example paypal is able to use location data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce risk to merchants and consumers our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having paypal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands 

competition 

the global payments industry is highly competitive we compete against a wide range of businesses including banks credit card providers technology and ecommerce companies and traditional retailers many of which are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer we compete against all forms of payments including credit and debit cards automated clearing house and bank transfers other online payment services mobile payments and offline payment methods including cash and check 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following

intellectual property 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks particularly those covering the paypal name patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business we protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services we have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to and limit disclosure of our proprietary information 

we pursue the registration of our domain names trademarks and service marks in the us and internationally additionally we have filed us and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology we have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the us and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest

“we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights” 

government regulation 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation noncompliance with laws and regulations increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate 

payments regulation  various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the us and globally in the us paypal inc holds licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent which among other things subjects paypal inc to reporting requirements bonding requirements limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state regulatory agencies outside the us we provide localized versions of our service to customers through various foreign subsidiaries the activities of those nonus entities are or may be supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate among other regulatory authorities the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” the australian securities and investment commission the monetary authority of singapore the reserve bank of india and the central bank of russia have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in country this list is not exhaustive as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction over our activities the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change 

banking agency supervision  we serve our customers in the european union through paypal europe sàrl et cie sca a whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg by the cssf consequently we must comply with rules and regulations of the banking industry including those related to capitalization funds management corporate governance antimoney laundering disclosure reporting and inspection we also are or may be subject to bankingrelated regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry in addition based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions in the us we are subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators 

consumer financial protection bureau  the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the united states including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products as a large market participant of remittance transfers the cfpb has direct supervisory authority over our business the cfpb and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business 

antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing  paypal is subject to antimoney laundering “aml” laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities we have implemented a comprehensive aml program designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activities or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets controls “ofac” and equivalent authorities in other countries our aml compliance program overseen by our compliance officer is composed of policies procedures and internal controls and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks 

interchange fees  interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions for example in the european union the multilateral interchange fee “mif” regulation which became effective in december 2015 caps credit and debit interchange fees for cards payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card transactions including paypal as a result the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge 

data protection and information security  aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere for example in the united states we are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act that require the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program and in europe the operations of our luxembourg bank are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the luxembourg banking act among other laws regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux 

anticorruption paypal is subject to applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act and similar anticorruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates anticorruption laws generally prohibit offering promising giving or authorizing others to provide anything of value either directly or indirectly to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage such as to obtain or retain business we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations 

additional regulatory developments  various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues including virtual currencies identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that may impact paypals business

the following discussion is divided into three sections the first section which begins immediately following this paragraph discusses some of the risks that may adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition the second section captioned “risks related to the separation and our operation as an independent publicly traded company” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company the third section captioned “risks related to our common stock” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our common stock you should carefully review all of these sections for important information regarding risks and uncertainties that affect us in addition to the other information appearing in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business   if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

  

risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business 

the global payments industry is highly competitive and we compete against a wide range of businesses many of which are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer as online and offline commerce are increasingly converging the pace of change innovation and disruption is also increasing the global payments industry is rapidly changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny which may negatively affect the competitive landscape many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competition may also intensify as businesses against which we compete or merchants enter into business combinations and alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business we compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments including 



 

we often partner with many of these businesses and we consider the ability to continue establishing these partnerships as important to our business competition for relationships with these partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to establish grow or maintain these partner relationships 

we also face competition and potential competition from 

 

some of these competitors have greater customer bases volume scale resources and market share than we do which may provide significant competitive advantages some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing and other regulatory requirements they may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of products and services and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following 

 

if we are not able to differentiate our business from those of our competitors drive value for our customers or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business 

substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter which may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as well as the trading price of our common stock 

substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter as a result our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our limited operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including as a result of the risks set forth in this “risk factors” section it is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings loss accurately in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock could decline perhaps substantially as a result of the factors described in this paragraph 

global and regional economic conditions could harm our business 

our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse economic conditions and events have negatively impacted global and regional financial markets in the past and uncertainty about global and regional economic events and conditions may result in consumers and businesses postponing spending in response to tighter credit higher unemployment financial market volatility government austerity programs negative financial news declines in income or asset values and other factors these and other global and regional economic events and conditions could have a material adverse impact on demand for our products and services including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform in addition any financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry significant financial service institution failures new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income credit currency and equity markets which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services the use of our products and services and consequently our revenues could decline 

rapid significant and disruptive technological changes continue to impact the industries in which we operate including developments in payment card tokenization mobile social commerce ie ecommerce through social networks authentication virtual currencies distributed ledger technologies near field communication and other proximity payment devices such as contactless payments we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful in addition our ability to adopt new products and services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industrywide standards payments networks changes to laws and regulations resistance to change from consumers or merchants thirdparty intellectual property rights or other factors our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable to do so in a timely or costeffective manner our business could be harmed 

changes in how consumers fund their paypal transactions could harm our business 

we pay significant transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance or through our paypal credit products our financial success is sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards collectively “payment cards” which can significantly increase our costs while we provide consumers with the opportunity to use their existing paypal account balance to fund payment transactions some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards especially if these payment cards offer functionality and benefits not associated with the use of their bank accounts some of our offerings including the ability of consumers to make a limited number of “guest” payments without opening a paypal account have a higher rate of payment card funding than our basic product offering an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or existing paypal account balances could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business some of 

our plans to lower our funding costs including our paypal credit products and enabling consumers to defer payment for a short period of time on some transactions may increase the risk to us of nonpayment by consumers 

negotiated arrangements with payment card networks andor issuing banks promoting greater choice and options for consumers to fund payment transactions could have an uncertain impact on our business we have entered into a strategic partnership with partners such as visa usa inc “visa” mastercard international incorporated “mastercard” and dfs services llc “discover” to make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to pay with these partners’ credit andor debt cards and allow us to gain access to these partners tokenization services for instore point of sale paypal transactions while we anticipate these and similar strategic partnerships we may enter in the future will result in an increase in the number of transactions and transaction volume that we process we also anticipate that a greater percentage of customer transactions will be executed using a credit or debit card which would likely increase our funding costs if our transaction volume does not increase as expected our business and results of operations could be adversely affected due to increased costs associated with our funding mix 

our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches 

our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data including financial information in addition a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us we have built our reputation on the premise that our payments platform offers customers a secure way to make payments an increasing number of organizations including large merchants and businesses other large technology companies financial institutions and government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on portions of their websites or infrastructure 

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to our systems our data or customers data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized until launched against a target unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including among others hacking into our systems or facilities or those of our customers partners or vendors or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees customers partners vendors or other users of our systems into disclosing user names passwords payment card information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems certain efforts may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect we believe that paypal is a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our products and services although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and expect to continue to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections these security measures cannot provide absolute security our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems our security measures may also be breached due to human error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operations result in our systems or services being unavailable result in improper disclosure of data materially harm our reputation and brands result in significant legal and financial exposure lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services and adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition any breaches of network or data security at our customers partners or vendors including data center and cloud computing providers could have similar negative effects actual or perceived vulnerabilities or data breaches may lead to claims against us 

in addition under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses we also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches among other reasons financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us and the european union “eu” have implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs require us to change our business practices make it more difficult for new customers to join paypal and reduce the ease of use of our products which could harm our business additionally while we maintain insurance policies they may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able to collect fully if at all under these insurance policies 

systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites applications products or services could harm our business 

our systems and those of our services providers and partners may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions computer denialofservice and other cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires natural disasters power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events our systems also may be subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition as a provider of payments solutions we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans which may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities 

we have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failures denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our products and services these events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue a prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability speed or other functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services and could permanently harm our reputation and brands moreover to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their business partners these customers or partners could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims even if unsuccessful would likely be timeconsuming and costly for us to address and could have other consequences described in this “risk factors” section under the caption “our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches” 

our payments platform has experienced significant intermittent unavailability reliability is particularly critical for us because the fulltime availability of our products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital payments we have undertaken certain system upgrades and replatforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed these efforts are costly and timeconsuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fines and penalties and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices and ultimately could cause us to lose existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that we need to expand our business 

we also rely on facilities components and services supplied by third parties including data center facilities and cloud storage services if these third parties cease to provide the facilities components or services experience operational interference or disruptions breach their agreements with us or fail to meet our expectations our operations could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which could result in customer dissatisfaction damage to our reputation and brands and materially and adversely affect our business we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events 

changes to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our business 

we do not directly access the payment card networks such as visa and mastercard that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards including some types of prepaid cards accordingly we must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services from time to time payment card networks have increased and may increase in the future the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their networks payment card networks have or may impose special assessments for transactions that are executed through a “digital wallet” such as paypal’s and such fees could particularly impact us and significantly increase our costs our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income we have entered into strategic partnerships with visa and mastercard to further expand our relationships with these networks in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay with visa and mastercard credit and debit cards during the term of the agreements visa and mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fees or rules solely targeted at paypal upon termination of the agreements paypal could become subject to special digital wallet fees or other special assessments 

in addition in some jurisdictions governments have required visa and mastercard to reduce interchange fees or have opened investigations as to whether visa’s or mastercard’s interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law in the us the federal reserve board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than visa or mastercard previously charged in the eu the multilateral interchange fee regulation limits credit and debit interchange fees for payments and imposes business rules on card processing services any material change in credit or debit card interchange rates in the us or other markets 

including as a result of changes in interchange fee limitations could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers future changes to those regulations could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 

we are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants and we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants the payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules from time to time the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules if such allegations are not resolved favorably they may result in material fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement as a result we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged if we are unable to accept payment cards or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so our business would be adversely affected 

we and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines we are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk” primarily the sale of certain types of digital content for “high risk” merchants we must either prevent such merchants from using our paypal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants although the amount of these fines has not been material to date additional fines in the future could become material and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers which would materially harm our business payment card network rules may also increase the cost of impose restrictions on or otherwise negatively impact the development of our retail pointofsale solutions which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption 

failure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transactions bad transactions and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services 

we incur substantial losses due to claims from consumers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant’s description we seek to recover such losses from the merchant but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay in addition in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use eg airline cruise or concert tickets custommade goods and subscriptions we could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may be insufficient 

we also incur substantial losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase from consumer fraud from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments in addition if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment which would harm our business we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings if these measures do not succeed our business could be harmed 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar additionally in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies we generally set our foreign exchange rates twice per day we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in nonus currencies our financial results are affected by the translation of these nonus currencies into us dollars we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries while we regularly enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results 

any factors that reduce crossborder trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business 

crossborder trade ie transactions where the merchant or consumer are in different countries is an important source of our revenue and profits crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market crossborder trade also represents our primary and in some cases our only presence in certain important markets 

crossborder trade is subject to and may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations in addition the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer are often extremely complicated in the context of crossborder trade changes to or the interpretation andor application of laws applicable to crossborder trade could impose additional requirements which may impose conflicting obligations and restrictions on crossborder trade and increase the costs associated with crossborder trade any factors that increase the costs of crossborder trade or restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business 

the united kingdom’s departure from the eu could adversely affect us 

the united kingdom “uk” held a referendum on june 23 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the eu “brexit” negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu including among other things the terms of trade between the uk and the eu the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk reaches to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the outcome of this referendum caused volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and uncertainty about the terms and impact of brexit may continue to do so in the future brexit could adversely affect uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro which in turn could adversely affect our customers and companies with which we do business particularly in the uk in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate in particular depending on the terms of brexit we may face new regulatory costs and challenges including the following 

 

any of these effects of brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight as well as extensive complex overlapping and frequently changing rules regulations and legal interpretations 

our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight for a discussion of how government regulation impacts key aspects of our business please see “item 1 business—government regulation” in this annual report on form 10k our business is also subject to laws rules regulations policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate including but not limited to those governing banking credit deposit taking crossborder and domestic money transmission foreign exchange privacy data protection banking secrecy payment services including payment processing and settlement services consumer protection economic and trade sanctions antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive complex frequently changing and increasing in number and may impose overlapping andor conflicting requirements or obligations 

financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business 

as we expand and localize our international activities we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate in addition because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of 

goods and provide services to customers worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws laws regulating the internet mobile and related technologies outside of the us often impose different more specific or even conflicting obligations on us as well as broader liability for example certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” or us antimoney laundering or counterterrorist financing regulations 

any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations including those discussed in this risk factor may subject us to significant fines penalties criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions result in additional compliance and licensure requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operations force us to change our business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements the foregoing could individually or in the aggregate expose us to significant liability impose significant costs require us to expend substantial resources increase the cost and complexity of compliance damage our brands and business make our products and services less attractive result in the loss of customers limit our ability to grow the business adversely affect our results of operations and harm our reputation the complexity of us federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

payments regulation 

in the us paypal inc has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in the states where it is required as well as in the district of columbia the us virgin islands and puerto rico these licenses include not only the paypal branded products and services in these states but also our venmo and xoom branded products and services as a licensed money transmitter paypal is subject to restrictions with respect to the investment of customer funds reporting requirements bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies accordingly if we violate these laws or regulations we could be subject to liability andor additional restrictions forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states forced to change our business practices or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose substantial costs 

while we currently allow our customers with credit cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets including the us to also receive payments in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds these limitations may affect our ability to grow our business in these markets of the markets whose residents can use our paypal services almost 30 of them are in member states of the eu 

we provide our services to customers in the eu through paypal europe our whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg accordingly paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure reporting antimoneylaundering capitalization fund management corporate governance privacy data protection information security banking secrecy taxation sanctions or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks in addition eu laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the eu which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage moreover the countries that are members of the eu may each have different and potentially inconsistent interpretations of regulations implementing the eu payment services directive and the emoney directive which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage the revised payment services directive “psd2” entered into force in january 2016 and will need to be implemented into national legislation by january 2018 the implementation of the psd2 may negatively affect our business finally if paypal europe exceed certain thresholds or if the european central bank “ecb” determines that paypal europe is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of paypal europe is subject to oversight by the ecb paypal europe or certain of its activities could become directly regulated by the ecb in addition to the luxembourg regulator the commission de surveillance du secteur financier as its national supervisor which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs 

in australia we serve our customers through paypal australia pty ltd “paypal australia” which is licensed by the australian securities and investments commission as a provider of a noncash payment product and by the australian prudential regulation authority as a purchased payment facility provider which is a type of authorized depository institution accordingly paypal australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capital requirements privacy corporate governance or other requirements imposed on australian depository institutions 

in many of the other markets in which we do business we serve our customers through paypal pte ltd our whollyowned subsidiary that is based in singapore paypal pte ltd is supervised by the monetary authority of singapore and is designated as a holder of a stored value facility and does not hold a remittance license as a result paypal pte ltd is not able to offer outbound remittance payments including donations to charities from singapore and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in singapore in many of the markets other than singapore served by paypal pte ltd it is unclear and uncertain whether our singaporebased service is subject only to singapore law or if it is subject to the application of local laws whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service bank financial institution or otherwise 

we are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses certifications and approvals even if we were able to obtain such licenses certifications and approvals there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses certifications and approvals and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses these factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products or services or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market 

in many other countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider bank financial institution or otherwise in such markets we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange transactions in local currency local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through local banks or otherwise prohibit us from doing business in a country such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services require significant and costly operational changes impose restrictions limitations or additional requirements on our business or prevent us from providing any products or services in a given market for example in june 2016 we suspended our operations in turkey following cease and desist instructions from turkey’s regulatory body bankacýlýk düzenleme ve denetleme kurumu “bddk” following the bddk’s rejection of our application for an emoney payments license 

consumer protection 

the financial services sector is subject to significant regulation and we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate in the us we are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations applicable to our activities including the electronic fund transfer act “efta” and regulation e as implemented by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” under such regulations we are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services follow specified error resolution procedures and reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer among other requirements additionally technical violations of consumer protection laws could result in the assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to 1000 in individual cases or up to 500000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees in such cases we are subject to and have paid amounts in settlement of lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the efta and regulation e or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices eg that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts 

in october 2016 the cfpb issued a final rule on prepaid accounts with an effective date of october 1 2017 the rule’s definition of prepaid account includes certain loadable accounts whose primary function is to conduct transactions with multiple unaffiliated merchants at atms andor for persontoperson transfers including certain digital wallets the rule’s requirements include the disclosure of fees and other information to the consumer prior to the creation of a prepaid account the extension of regulation e liability limits and errorresolution requirements to all prepaid accounts the application of credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 credit card requirements to prepaid accounts with overdraft and credit features and the submission of prepaid account agreements to the cfpb and their publication to the general public we are evaluating the rule and its requirements implementation of the rule could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices and the design of certain products allocate additional resources and increase our costs which could negatively affect our business 

in may 2015 we entered into a stipulated final judgment and consent order “consent order” with the cfpb in which we settled regulatory claims arising from paypal credit practices between 2011 and 2015 the consent order included obligations on paypal to pay 15 million in redress to consumers and a 10 million civil monetary penalty and required paypal to make various changes to paypal credit disclosures and related business practices we continue to cooperate and engage with the cfpb and work to ensure compliance with the consent order which may result in us incurring additional costs 

paypal europe offers its services in eu countries through a “passport” notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other eu member states pursuant to eu directives and has completed the “passport” notification process in all eu member countries the regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of or delay our plans to expand our business in eu countries 

economic and trade sanctions 

we are subject to us economic and trade sanctions administered by ofac we have selfreported to ofac certain transactions that were inadvertently processed but subsequently identified as possible violations of us economic and trade sanctions in march 2015 we reached a settlement with ofac regarding possible violations arising from our sanctions compliance practices between 2009 and 2013 prior to the implementation of our realtime transaction scanning program subsequently we have selfreported additional transactions as possible violations and we have received new subpoenas from ofac seeking additional information about certain of these transactions such selfreported transactions could result in claims or actions against us including litigation injunctions damage awards fines or penalties or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could result in a material loss require significant management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business 

antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing 

we are subject to various antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit among other things our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities us and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions many countries in which we operate also have antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations and we have been and continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response regulators regularly reexamine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance in the eu the implementation of the fourth antimoney laundering directive and the regulation on information accompanying transfer of funds commonly known as the revised wire transfer regulation which both come into effect on june 26 2017 could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage lead to increased friction for customers and result in a decrease in business penalties for noncompliance with the fourth antimoney laundering directive could include fines of up to 10 of paypal europe’s total annual turnover the eu institutions are also proposing changes to the fourth antimoney laundering directive which could be even more stringent 

privacy and protection of user data 

we are subject to a number of laws rules and directives which we refer to as “privacy laws” relating to the collection use retention security processing and transfer which we refer to as “process” of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees which we refer to as “personal data” in the countries where we operate much of the personal data that we process especially financial information is regulated by multiple privacy laws and in some cases the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between or among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relationships 

regulatory scrutiny of privacy data protection collection use and sharing of data is increasing on a global basis there is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict including with respect to evolving technologies such as cloud computing privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy and data protectionrelated laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide products and services to our customers a determination that there have been violations of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business and reputation 

in october 2015 the european court of justice ruled that the useu safe harbor framework clauses one compliance method by which companies could transfer personal data regarding citizens of the eu to the us could no longer be relied upon the us and eu authorities have agreed in principle on a replacement for safe harbor known as “privacy shield” the privacy shield 

approach has not been fully endorsed by all relevant parties and there have already been challenges to this initiative in the european justice system paypal has chosen to adopt eu model clauses published by the european commission as a basis for the export of data from the eu to the us for those parts of our business that had previously relied on safe harbor in addition because paypal europe is headquartered in luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction we have relied on the “onestopshop” concept under which luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the eu however a recent european court of justice ruling weltimmo affecting companies that do business in the eu potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various eu member states in which we have established legal entities and which apply privacy laws that are different than and which may even conflict with those in luxembourg 

in addition because of the large number of text messages emails phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes communicationrelated privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines for example under the telephone consumer protection act “tcpa” in the us plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of 500 per violation whichever is greater and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations we have been are and may continue to be subject to lawsuits including classaction lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the tcpa these lawsuits seek damages including statutory damages and injunctive relief among other remedies given the large number of communications we send to our customers a determination that there have been violations of the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business 

the eu has recently adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single european economic area privacy regulation the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which comes into effect in 2018 the proposed eu data protection regime extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of eu residents it provides for a harmonization of the data protection regulations throughout the eu thereby making it easier for noneuropean companies to comply with these regulations it imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4 of worldwide turnover and €20 million and includes new rights such as the “portability” of personal data although the gdpr will apply across the eu without a need for local implementing legislation as has been the case under the current data protection regime local data protection authorities “dpas” will still have the ability to interpret the gdpr which has the potential to create inconsistencies on a countrybycountry basis we are evaluating the rule and its requirements implementation of the gdpr could require changes to certain of our business practices thereby increasing our costs 

we post on our websites and applications our privacy policies and practices regarding the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders or privacy data protection information security or consumer protectionrelated privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business data protection privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public media and legislative concern if our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns our business could be materially harmed as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their financial or performance obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the us and abroad as part of our currency hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments with various financial institutions certain banks and financial institutions are also lenders under our revolving credit facility we regularly monitor our exposure to counterparty credit risk and actively manage this exposure to mitigate the associated risk despite these efforts we may be exposed to the risk of default by or deteriorating operating results or financial condition or failure of these counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default deterioration or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to access or recover our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

paypal is not a bank or licensed lender in the us and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business 

as paypal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state in the us we rely on a thirdparty chartered financial institution to issue the paypal credit consumer product in the us and a different chartered financial institution to issue the paypal working capital product in the us both of these chartered financial institutions are industrial banks chartered by the state of utah in the event of a termination or interruption in the ability of the chartered financial institution that currently issues the paypal credit consumer product in the us to lend under the paypal credit consumer product the chartered financial institution that issues the paypal working capital product in the us has agreed to take ownership of and originate loans with respect to all paypal credit consumer accounts nevertheless any termination or interruption of either bank’s ability to lend could result in the inability or unwillingness to originate any new paypal credit or paypal working capital loans in the event of either bank’s inability or unwillingness to lend we would either need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or licenses we may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a timeconsuming and costly process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements which could be burdensome and increase our costs in addition our commercial relationships with third parties which are federally supervised us financial institutions could subject us to examination by their federal banking regulators with respect to certain services that we provide 

in 2015 the us second circuit court of appeals madden v midland funding llc 786 f3d 246 2d cir 2015 concluded that the buyer of a charged off credit card account could not rely on the national bank acts preemption of state interest rate limits for interest at rates imposed by the buyer after chargeoff a petition to the us supreme court to review the decision was denied in june 2016 and the case has been remanded to the lower court to be determined in accordance with the ruling of the second circuit the decision has resulted in some uncertainty as to whether nonbank entities purchasing loans originated by a bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury laws and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiffs challenging our ability to collect interest and fees in accordance with the terms of certain loans although the madden decision specifically addressed preemption under the national bank act this decision could support future challenges to federal preemption for other institutions including fdicinsured state chartered industrial banks like those that we rely on to issue our loan products in the us although we believe the madden case can be distinguished from the manner in which we offer our credit products there can be no assurances as to the outcome of any potential litigation or that the possible impact of such litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business 

our credit products expose us to additional risks 

our paypal credit and paypal working capital products are offered to a wide range of consumers and merchants and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of the risk related to these products the lender for the paypal credit product extends credit using proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history with paypal as well as their credit scores similarly to assess a merchant who wishes to obtain a paypal working capital advance among other indicators the lender applies a proprietary risk model to help predict the merchants ability to repay the working capital advance these risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions about the particular consumer or merchant or the economic environment or limited transaction history among other factors the accuracy of these risk models and the ability of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our paypal credit and paypal working capital products may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes competitors’ actions changes in consumer behavior changes in the economic environment and other factors 

like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer and merchant credit we face the risk that paypal credit and paypal working capital account holders will default on their payment obligation creating the risk of potential chargeoffs the nonpayment rate among account holders may increase due to among other things changes to underwriting standards worsening economic conditions such as a recession or greater austerity in various countries increases in prevailing interest rates and high unemployment rates account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans 

we purchase receivables related to our paypal credit products and originated loans with respect to our paypal working capital products if we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a costeffective manner or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes our business could be harmed 

our international expansion of our paypal credit product offerings exposes us to additional risks including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “our international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business” 

our business may be impacted by political events war terrorism public health issues natural disasters and other business interruptions 

war terrorism geopolitical uncertainties public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to the economy and commerce on a global or regional basis which could have a material adverse effect on our business our customers and companies with which we do business our business operations are subject to interruption by among others natural disasters fire power shortages earthquakes floods nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents terrorist attacks and other hostile acts labor disputes public health issues and other events beyond our control such events could decrease demand for our products and services or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers in the event of a natural disaster we could incur significant losses require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations 

changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate 

our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions in 2015 we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services in addition consumers who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer usually a bank which in turn will seek recovery from us the risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers sellers and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements or changes that we decide to implement such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs upon paypal becoming an independent publicly traded company on july 17 2015 we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on ebay and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased increases in our loss rate including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs could harm our business 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business 

our international operations have generated approximately onehalf of our net revenues in recent years in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets and the foreign currency risks discussed earlier in this “risk factors” section under the caption “we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” there are risks inherent in doing business internationally on both a domestic ie incountry and crossborder basis including 



violations of the complex foreign and us laws rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws violations by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur these risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion may increase our costs of doing business internationally and could harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts a low interest rate environment or reductions in interest rates may negatively impact our investment income and our net income in addition fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

in july 2015 we entered into a revolving credit facility as a result to the extent of our borrowings under the facility which bear interest at a floating rate we will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations 

use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business 

our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses including money laundering terrorist financing illegal online gambling fraudulent sales of goods or services illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances piracy of software movies music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods in particular digital goods money laundering bank fraud child pornography trafficking prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products online securities fraud or to facilitate other illegal activity certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing or exporting illegal goods resulting in liability for us changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional paymentsrelated proposals are under active consideration by government authorities intellectual property rights owners or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions including paypal that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items any threatened or resulting claims could result in reputational harm and any resulting liabilities loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business 

our failure to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business 

we hold a substantial amount of funds belonging to our customers including deposits in customer accounts and funds being remitted to sellers of goods and services our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls as our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls for example in march 2016 as approved by the supervisory board of paypal europe and as permitted by the cssf certain european customer balances held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary are being used to extend credit to our european customers our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customers’ balances and handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage our customer funds and the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines which could materially harm our business 

we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws 

we are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under us and foreign laws and regulations including antitrust and competition laws an increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us individual states other countries or the european commission or otherwise constitute unfair competition an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities including increased scrutiny in large markets such as china our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation some regulators particularly those outside of the us may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive any claims or investigations even if without foundation may be very expensive to defend or respond to involve negative publicity 

and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in reputational harm significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices 

we are subject to patent litigation 

we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents at any given time we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes we expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because among other reasons 

 

such claims may be brought directly against us or against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter we believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been and continue to be initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims in addition we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries patent claims whether meritorious or not are timeconsuming and costly to defend and resolve and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings or cease conducting certain operations which would harm our business 

we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is important to the success of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business 

effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights 

although we have generally taken measures to protect our intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction or that contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others if we are unable to prevent third parties from adopting registering or using trademarks and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights the value of our brands could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could diminish the value of our intangible assets and materially harm our business 

as the number of products in the technology and payments industries increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others the ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and regardless of the outcome any such claim with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business and require us to among other things stop providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services or redesign stop selling our products or services pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters may harm our business 

we are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory disputes and government inquiries 

we are regularly subject to claims individual and class action lawsuits government and regulatory investigations inquiries or requests and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust law intellectual property privacy data protection information security antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing sanctions anticorruption consumer protection accessibility claims securities tax labor and employment commercial disputes services escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property and other matters in particular our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation as discussed above the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products and services have increased in complexity in addition the laws rules and regulations affecting our business including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce payments services and credit are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations of those laws rules and regulations 

the scope outcome and impact of claims lawsuits government investigations and proceedings that we are subject to cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources reputational damage and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation and regulatory proceedings is a complex factintensive process that is subject to management’s judgment resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings any of which could materially and adversely affect our business these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business 

certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions or the class action waiver provisions in them in the future or in any given case legislative administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of predispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits including additional consumer class action litigation or materially impact our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient 

in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of losses in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items 

various levels of government such as us federal and state legislatures and international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” and the eu are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions could increase our effective tax rate 

we and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and recordkeeping obligations 

a number of us states the us federal government and foreign countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing reporting or recordkeeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce to improve tax compliance additionally a number of jurisdictions are reviewing whether payment service providers and other intermediaries could be deemed 

the legal agent of merchants for certain tax purposes we have modified our software to meet known requirements and expect further modifications will be required to comply with future requirements which may change our customer experience and increase operational costs any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and recordkeeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions impact our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions and harm our business 

acquisitions joint ventures strategic investments and other strategic transactions could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business 

acquisitions joint ventures strategic investments and other strategic transactions are important elements of our overall corporate strategy we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses technologies services products and other assets as well as joint ventures strategic investments and commercial and strategic partnerships these transactions may involve significant challenges and risks including 

 

at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these or other types of transactions any of which could individually or in the aggregate be material to our financial condition and results of operations there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt and increased interest expense liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or writeoffs of goodwill which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders 

joint ventures and minority investment inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partners controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who 

control them may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours business decisions or other actions or omissions of the joint venture partners controlling shareholders management or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business which creates additional risk 

we rely on third parties in many aspects of our business including the following 

 

third parties that we rely on to process transactions may fail or refuse to process transactions adequately and these and other third parties on whom we rely may breach their agreements with us refuse to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms take actions that degrade the functionality of our services impose additional costs or requirements on us or give preferential treatment to competitive services financial or regulatory issues labor issues or other problems that prevent these third parties from providing services to us or our customers could harm our business if our service providers do not perform satisfactorily our operations could be disrupted which could result in customer dissatisfaction damage our reputation and harm our business 

price increases or financial penalties by or service terminations disruptions or interruptions at companies that we rely on to provide services to us or our customers could disrupt our operations and harm our business some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint in addition there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms or at all if any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms including as a result of bankruptcy or other business interruption we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

our developer platforms which are open to merchants and thirdparty developers subject us to additional risks 

we provide thirdparty developers with access to application programming interfaces software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use with a particular focus on mobile applications there can be no assurance that merchants or thirdparty developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all and a number of factors could cause such thirdparty developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms in addition our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions it is possible that merchants and thirdparty developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations which could harm our business 

our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks 

we have announced several retail point of sale solutions which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to or otherwise communicating with a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale we have entered into strategic partnerships with visa mastercard and discover to further expand our relationship with these companies in a way that will make it easier for merchants to accept and consumers to choose to pay for transactions utilizing these companies credit and debit cards as part of those agreements we will gain access to each of these partners tokenization services in the us for instore pointofsale paypal transactions which we expect will increase the number of point of sale transactions that we process as we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale we will face additional risks including 



 

unless we are able to successfully manage these risks including driving adoption of and significant volume through our retail point of sale solutions over time our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on key personnel because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of key personnel could harm our business 

our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of key personnel including our executive team and other highly skilled employees and our ability to attract retain and motivate such personnel competition for key personnel is intense especially in the san francisco bay area where our corporate headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high and we may be unable to successfully attract integrate or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel in making employment decisions particularly in the technology and payments industries job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment and fluctuations in our stock price or a perception that the market price of our stock may not increase or may increase more slowly than stock prices at other technology or payments companies may make it more difficult to attract retain and motivate employees we are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws or policies in addition we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified key personnel could harm our business 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our products and services 

companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through them including claims alleging defamation libel breach of contract invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement among other things the laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the us and foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customerprovided content on our products and services particularly in jurisdictions outside the us where the applicable laws are unsettled if we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our products and services we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain product or service offerings which could harm our business 

risks related to the separation and our operation as an independent publicly traded company 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” ebay paypal and ebay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ebay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

on july 17 2015 we became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by ebay inc of 100 our outstanding common stock to ebay’s stockholders which we sometimes refer to as the “separation” or the “distribution” ebay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code the opinion was based on and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of ebay and of us including those relating to the past and future conduct of ebay and of us if any of these representations statements or undertakings were or became inaccurate or incomplete or if ebay or we breach any of our respective covenants in the separation documents the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution together with certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if the irs determines that any of these representations assumptions or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or any court and there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion the irs did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction is taxfree 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code in general ebay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the paypal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value ebay stockholders who received paypal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capitalraising transactions for a period of time following the separation in addition we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capitalraising transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to ebay of the separation and the distribution under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with ebay for a period of time following the distribution we are generally prohibited from taking certain actions that prevent the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we or our stockholders consider desirable or may prevent us from engaging in certain capitalraising transactions 

we have limited history of operating as an independent publicly traded company in our current form and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k were derived in part from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of ebay and do not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate independent publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below 

 

we may continue to experience significant changes in our cost structure management financing and business operations as a result of operating as an independent company separate from ebay for additional information please see “management’s 

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

ebay remains a significant source of our revenues 

we continue to derive a significant amount of revenues and operating income from ebay our relationship with ebay is governed in part by an operating agreement that was entered into at separation and has a term of five years when our operating agreement with ebay expires or if it is terminated prior to its expiration or if there is a significant change in our relationship with ebay including if ebay becomes a merchant of record eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers ebay customers more payment options our business could be materially harmed 

ebay may fail to perform under various agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire 

in connection with the separation we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with ebay as well as various other agreements including an operating agreement colocation services agreements transition services agreements a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a data sharing addendum and a product development agreement the separation agreement the tax matters agreement the employee matters agreement and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities including by means of licensing between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the operating agreement the colocation services agreements and the data sharing addendum establish certain commercial relationships between ebay and us related to payment processing credit information technology infrastructure and data sharing the transition services agreements provide for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited period of time after the separation if we or ebay is unable to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements including its respective indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to ebay if we do not have in place our own systems and services or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once these transaction agreements expire or terminate we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our financial condition and result of operations may be adversely affected 

after the separation certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at ebay 

because of their current or former positions with ebay certain of our directors own ebay common stock and equity awards following the separation even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent some of our directors continue to have a financial interest in ebay common stock and equity awards in addition one of our directors continues to serve on the ebay board of directors continuing ownership of ebay common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest if we and ebay were to have disagreements about the agreements between us or face decisions that could have different implications for us and ebay 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including but not limited to 

 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines the state courts of the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers alternatively if a court outside of delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above we could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

 

we have also elected not to be governed by section 203 of the dgcl which provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation however contains a provision that generally mirrors section 203 of the dgcl except that it provides for a 20 threshold instead of the 15 provided for by the dgcl these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor 

certain of the above provisions were added pursuant to the agreement between ebay inc and certain entities under the control of carl c icahn these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of us and our stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition an acquisition or further issuance of our stock including preferred stock could trigger the application of section 355e of the code for a discussion of section 355e see “material us federal income tax consequences” in our registration statement on form 10 as amended filed with the securities and exchange commission under the tax matters agreement in such circumstances we would be required to indemnify ebay for any resulting taxes which could materially and adversely affect us moreover this indemnity obligation might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable please refer to “certain relationships and related person transactions” and “description of paypal’s capital stock” in our registration statement on form 10 as amended filed with the securities and exchange commission for a more detailed description of these agreements and provisions

separation from ebay inc 

on september 30 2014 ebay inc “ebay” announced its intent to separate its payments business into an independent publicly traded company to accomplish this separation in january 2015 ebay incorporated paypal holdings inc “paypal holdings” which is now the parent of paypal inc and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with paypal inc in june 2015 the board of directors of ebay approved the separation the “separation” of ebays payments business through the distribution the “distribution” of 100 of the outstanding common stock of paypal holdings to ebays stockholders paypal holdings registration statement on form 10 as amended was declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission on june 29 2015 on july 17 2015 the “distribution date” paypal holdings became an independent publicly traded company through the pro rata distribution by ebay of 100 of the outstanding common stock of paypal holdings to ebay stockholders each ebay stockholder of record as of the close of business on july 8 2015 received one share of paypal holdings common stock for every share of ebay common stock held on the record date approximately 12 billion shares of paypal holdings common stock were distributed on july 17 2015 to ebay stockholders paypal holdings common stock began “regular way” trading under the ticker symbol “pypl” on the nasdaq stock market on july 20 2015 

prior to the separation ebay transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities and operations of ebays payments business to paypal holdings which was completed in june 2015 the “capitalization” the consolidated financial statements prior to the capitalization were prepared on a standalone basis and were derived from ebays consolidated financial statements and accounting records the consolidated financial statements reflect our financial position results of operations comprehensive income and cash flows as our business was operated as part of ebay prior to the capitalization following the capitalization our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of paypal holdings and its whollyowned subsidiaries the consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows as of dates and for periods prior to the separation may not be indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate standalone entity during the periods presented nor are they indicative of what our financial position results of operations and cash flows may be in the future for additional information see “note 1—overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires references to “we” “our” “us” “the company” and “paypal” refer to paypal holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries or in the case of information as of dates or for periods prior to the separation the consolidated entities of the payments business of ebay including paypal inc and certain other assets and liabilities that had been historically held at the ebay corporate level but were specifically identifiable and attributable to the payments business 

business environment 

we are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide our vision is to democratize financial services as we believe that managing and moving money is a right for all people not just the affluent our goal is to increase our relevance for consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world anytime on any platform and using any device our combined payment solutions including our paypal paypal credit braintree venmo xoom and paydiant products compose our proprietary payments platform 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation noncompliance with laws and regulations increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

the united kingdom uk held a referendum on june 23 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the european union eu “brexit” the outcome of this referendum caused volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations brexit could adversely affect the uk european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in regional or global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro we have foreign exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency rate movements in 2016  2015  and 2014  net revenues generated from our uk operations constituted 12  13  and 14  respectively of total net revenues in 2016  2015  and 2014  net revenues generated from the eu excluding the uk constituted approximately 20  of total net revenues for additional information on how brexit could affect our business see “item 1a risk factors” under the caption—“ the united kingdom’s departure from the european union could adversely affect us”   

information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased in recent years although we are not aware of any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches on our payments platform there can be no assurance that we are immune to these risks and will not suffer such losses in the future see “item 1a risk factors” under the caption—“ our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches ”

net revenues increased   16 billion  or 17  in 2016  and 12 billion  or 15  in 2015  the increase  was primarily driven by growth in tpv as defined below under “net revenues” of 26  in 2016  and 20  in 2015  net revenues from xoom acquired in november 2015 contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate and had no impact to the 2015 growth rate 

total operating expenses increased   15 billion  or 19  in 2016  and 1 billion  or 15  in 2015  the increase  in 2016  was due primarily to an increase  in transaction expense and transaction and loan losses and higher other operating expenses incurred to

operating income increased   125 million  or 9  in 2016  and 193 million  or 15  in 2015  operating income increased  in 2016  and 2015  primarily due to the increase  in net revenues and total operating expenses increasing less compared to the increase in net revenues from operating efficiencies xoom had a four percentage points negative impact to 2016 growth rates and a one percentage point negative impact to 2015 growth rates our operating margin was 15  16  and 16  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively operating margin decreased in 2016  primarily due to growth in our transaction expense and transaction and loan losses which together increased 30  in 2016  compared to 2015 operating margin was flat in 2015  compared to 2014

impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar in 2016  2015  and 2014  we generated approximately 47  50  and 52  of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the united states respectively during each of these periods the united kingdom “uk” was the only country other than the united states where we generated more than 10 of total net revenues in in 2016  2015  and 2014  net revenues generated from the eu excluding the uk constituted approximately 20   

of total net revenues because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods including during the periods presented we are subject to the risks of doing business in countries outside of the us as discussed under “item 1a risk factors—risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition” 

we calculate the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements however it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings 

in the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  the yearoveryear foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar had the following impact on our reported results 



additionally in connection with our services in multiple currencies we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates twice per day and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “other income expense net” which is offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities

net revenues 

revenue description 

we earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our payments platform and from other value added services our revenues are classified into the following two categories 

  



receivable revenue share we earn through partnerships interest earned on certain paypal customer account balances fees earned through our paydiant products and other services that we provide to consumers and merchants 

our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following 

  

 net revenues analysis 

the components of our net revenue for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



transaction revenues 

transaction revenues increased by 14 billion  or 17  in 2016  compared to 2015  and by 10 billion  or 14  in 2015  compared to 2014  xoom transaction revenues contributed two percentage points to the 2016 growth rate and had no impact to the 2015 growth rate the increase in transaction revenues in 2016  and 2015  was due primarily to the growth in tpv and in the number of payment transactions both of which were due primarily to increased engagement from our customers measured by payment transactions per active account and the increase in our active customer accounts net gains from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2016  were 119 million  compared to 182 million  in 2015 refer to “note 8—derivative instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program 

the following table provides a summary of our active customer accounts number of payment transactions tpv and related metrics 



all amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions except as otherwise noted as a result certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided 

1  an active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products in the past 12 months 

2  payment transactions are the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products 

3  number of payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period 

4  total payment volume or “tpv” is the value of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products 

 not meaningful 

the percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth in tpv and payment transactions in 2016  due primarily to a higher portion of persontoperson “p2p” transactions including our venmo products for which we earn 

lower rates and a higher portion of tpv generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volume the percentage growth in transaction revenues was lower than the percentage growth in tpv and payment transactions in 2015  due to a higher portion of tpv generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates on higher transaction volume and a lower mix of crossborder transactions crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market the percent of tpv generated by large merchants increased in 2016  and 2015  the impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact revenue growth in 2016  or 2015  

other value added services 

net revenues from other value added services increased by 232 million  or 21  in 2016  compared to 2015  and by 202 million  or 22  in 2015  compared to 2014  growth in net revenues from other valueadded services in 2016 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on our paypal credit loans receivable portfolio the total consumer and merchant loans receivable balance as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  was 57 billion  and 44 billion  respectively reflecting a year over year increase of 29  the increase in net revenues from other value added services in 2015 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from consumers and merchants that used our paypal credit products revenue share earned under our credit program agreement with synchrony financial and the gain on sale of a participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable that we purchased as described further below 

in the third quarter of 2015 we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with synchrony financial as a result of the amendment we recognized 78 million of additional revenue under the agreement during 2015 in addition as part of the amended agreement our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with synchrony financial was terminated we retain an option to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term 

in the second quarter of 2015 we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in certain consumer loans and interest receivable related to our paypal credit products with a gross book value of approximately 708 million as a result of the arrangement the impact to net revenues from other value added services during 2015 was a net decrease of 35 million compared to 2014 due to the reduction in net revenues earned from interest and fees on the participation interests sold partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the participation interest inclusive of the gain of 26 million recognized on the initial sale of approximately 708 million in certain consumer loans receivable and servicing fees 

operating expenses 

beginning with the first quarter of 2016 we reclassified certain operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income to better align our external and internal financial reporting these classification changes relate primarily to real estate and information technology operating expenses that were previously allocated among customer support and operations expense sales and marketing expense and product development expense our management no longer allocates these operating expenses for internal financial reporting purposes or general management of the business and has therefore discontinued this allocation for external financial reporting purposes as a result starting with the first quarter of 2016 these operating expenses were reported as part of general and administrative expenses these changes have no impact on the previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods including total operating expenses financial position or cash flows for any periods presented and do not eliminate any of the costs allocated to us by ebay for any periods prior to the separation prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation see “note 1—overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of operating expenses to our previously reported consolidated statement of income growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts 

the following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each 



1 transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by tpv 

2 transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by tpv 

 not meaningful 

transaction expense 

transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment these costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our paypal credit funding option we refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix” the cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a paypal account balance or paypal credit as we expand the availability of alternative funding sources to our customers a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate for example in connection with our customer choice initiatives we expect that our transaction expense rate will increase the cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the us than in the us 

transaction expense increased   736 million  or 28  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increases in transaction expense in 2016  was primarily attributable to an increase in tpv which increased 26  in 2016  transaction expense increased by 440 million or 20  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase in transaction expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in tpv offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the us dollar 

our transaction expense rate in 2016  increased compared to 2015  due primarily to changes in funding mix for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  approximately 2  of tpv was funded with paypal credit for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  approximately 45  45  and 48  of tpv respectively was generated outside of the us our transaction expense rate in 2015  increased compared to 2014  due to higher assessments charged by payments processors and other financial institutions partially offset by cost efficiencies from our payments platform and a more favorable funding mix interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable included in transaction expense was not material for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

transaction and loan losses 

transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud and chargebacks loan losses include the losses associated with our paypal credit loans receivable portfolio we expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors including tpv macroeconomic conditions changes to our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our paypal credit products and working capital advances to select merchant sellers additionally prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts from ebay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible ebay purchases made with paypal these costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with ebays customer protection programs that we administered and 

funded on behalf of ebay which were included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses recoveries associated with protection losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases during the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  were 27 million  and 43 million  respectively following the distribution we no longer administer ebays customer protection programs or recover amounts from ebay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases instead we and ebay each independently administer our own customer protection programs further our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on ebay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution 

the components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were as follows 



transaction and loan losses increased 279 million  or 34  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased 163 million  or 25  in 2015  compared to 2014  

transaction losses increased  by 144 million  or 28  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily attributable to higher tpv our transaction loss rate calculated by dividing transaction loss by tpv in 2016  was flat compared to 2015  the growth in transaction losses in 2016  was higher than the growth in tpv in 2016  due primarily to lower incremental costs in 2015 associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution transaction losses increased  by 103 million  or 25  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily attributable to higher tpv our transaction loss rate in 2015  increased compared to 2014  due to lower recoveries in 2015 associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases offset by improved consumer loss performance and a higher provision in the prior year from actual losses incurred 

loan losses increased   135 million  or 45  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased   60 million  or 25  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase in loan losses in 2016  was due primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year and additional reserves recorded in the current period due to increases to forecasted principal balance delinquency rates the total consumer loans receivable balance as of december 31 2016  and 2015  was 51 billion  and 40 billion  respectively reflecting a year over year increase of 28  the increase in loan losses in 2015 was due primarily to an increase in the loans receivable balance year over year the total consumer loans receivable balance as of december 31 2015  and 2014  was 40 billion  and 37 billion respectively reflecting a year over year increase of 8 in 2015 including the sale of additional participation interests to certain investors in the second quarter of 2015 the increase in consumer loans receivables in 2016 and 2015 was due to the growth in the portfolio of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers who chose paypal credit as a funding option and an increase in working capital advances to selected merchant sellers 

the following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our pool of consumer loans and interest receivable balance 



1 excludes certain outstanding consumer loans outside of the us for which no fico scores are available with an outstanding balance of 117 million  and 70 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015 respectively   

2  net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year 

3  represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer 

we offer credit products to certain existing small and mediumsized merchants through our paypal working capital product the total paypal working capital advances and fees receivable “merchant receivables” outstanding as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  were 558 million  and 421 million  respectively reflecting a year over year increase of 33  due to the increase in the availability of our credit products domestically and internationally to assess a merchant seeking a paypal working capital advance we use among other indicators a risk model that we have internally developed that we refer to as our paypal working capital risk model “prm” as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchants ability to repay the principal balance and fixed fee related to the working capital advance the prm uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchants ability to repay a working capital advance primary drivers of the model include the merchants annual payment volume and payment processing history with paypal prior repayment history with the paypal working capital product and other measures merchants are assigned a prm credit score within the range of 350  to 750  we generally expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital advance will have prm scores greater than 525  we generally consider scores above 610  to be very good and to pose less credit risk we assess a participating merchant’s prm score on a recurring basis at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the weighted average prm score related to our paypal working capital balances outstanding was 625  and 630  respectively 

the determination of the number of days our merchant receivables are outstanding is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period we generally calculate the repayment rate based on the merchants estimated future payment volume so that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is expected to occur within 9  to 12  months from the date of the advance on a regular basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable as such actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes we monitor receivables with repayment periods greater than the original expected repayment period in the second quarter of 2016 we refined our estimate of the original expected repayment period to take into account the variability in repayment patterns prior period amounts have been updated to reflect this change 

the following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant receivables 



1  amounts in the prior periods were updated to reflect changes in our estimate of the original expected repayment period 

the changes in percentage of merchant receivables past their expected repayment period at december 31 2016  over december 31 2015  were due primarily to the increase in longer duration merchant loans in 2016 compared to the prior year which increased the seasonality of repayments trends modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our paypal credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loans 

customer support and operations 

customer support and operations expenses include costs incurred to provide 24hour call support to our customers our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our payments platform costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers and other costs incurred in our operations centers customer support and operations costs increased   157 million  or 14  in 2016  compared to 2015  and 119 million  or 12  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase  in 2016  was due primarily to an increase  in contractor and employee related expenses to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our payments platform the increase in 2015  was predominantly related to an increase in headcount to service the growth in our active customer accounts and the number of payment transactions occurring on our payments platform and an increase in expenses to operate as an independent public company offset in part by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the us dollar 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of customer acquisition business development advertising marketing programs and employee compensation and contractor costs to support these programs sales and marketing expenses increased   32 million  or 3  in 2016  compared to 2015  the increase  in 2016  was due primarily to higher marketing spend related to xoom on advertising campaigns intended to enhance our global brand recognition sales and marketing expense decreased  by 17 million  or 2  in 

2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in 2015  was due primarily to a decrease in employee and contractor related expenses and favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the us dollar offset in part by higher marketing spend 

product development 

product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and contractor costs that are incurred in connection with the development of our payments platform new products and the improvement of our existing products product development expenses exclude software and website development costs that are capitalized the amortization of developed technology is included in depreciation and amortization expense 

product development expenses increased   42 million  or 5  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased   45 million  or 6  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase  in 2016  was due primarily to an increase  in employee related expenses driven primarily by xoom offset by a decrease  in contractor related expenses the increase in 2015  was due primarily to investments in our payments platform creating new mobile experiences for our customers and supporting our strategic initiatives partially offset by a decrease in employee and contractor related expenses 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business including legal human resources finance executive and other support operations our legal expenses including those related to ongoing legal proceedings case settlements and judgments and regulatory proceedings and fines may fluctuate substantially from period to period 

for periods prior to the separation our consolidated financial statements include expenses associated with workplace resources and information technology that were previously allocated to the payments segment of ebay and additional expenses related to certain corporate functions including senior management legal human resources and finance these expenses also include allocations related to stockbased compensation the expenses that were incurred by ebay have been allocated to us based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenue headcount or other systematic measure the corporate costs and allocation of expenses from ebay may not be indicative of the expenses that may have been incurred had we been a separate standalone entity during the periods presented nor are the results stated herein indicative of the expenses we may incur in the future such expenses could be higher or lower in the periods presented a significant portion of expenses associated with these functions and allocated to us in our consolidated financial statements are included in general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased   155 million  or 18  in 2016  compared to 2015  and increased   140 million  or 19  in 2015  compared to 2014  the increase  in 2016  was due primarily to an increase  in employee expenses contractor related expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company and continued investments in compliance programs the increase in 2015 was due primarily to an increase in expenses incurred to operate as an independent public company and an increase in expenses associated with professional services including contractor related expenses and regulatory matters in 2015 121 million of corporate costs and expenses allocated to us by ebay were included in general and administrative expenses compared to 207 million in 2014 representing a decrease of 86 million or 42 compared to 2014

restructuring 

in january 2015 at a regular meeting of ebay’s board of directors the “ebay board” the ebay board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce the reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses restructuring expenses were 48 million  in 2015 no restructuring expenses were recognized in 2016 or 2014 

income tax expense 

our effective tax rate was 14  in 2016  17  in 2015  and 67  in 2014  the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016  was primarily due to favorable discrete tax adjustments during the year ended   december 31 2016  and other separationrelated costs incurred during the year ended   december 31 2015  the decrease in our effective tax rate during 2015  compared to 2014  was due primarily to the recognition in 2014 of a us deferred tax liability of approximately 650 million on 19 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years see “note 16—income taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for more information on our effective tax rate 

nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that are different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” pursuant to the requirements of regulation sk portions of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include a reconciliation of certain nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures the presentation of nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 

we present nongaap financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of our results between periods management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation 

we exclude the following items from nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share nongaap operating income nongaap operating margin nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap income tax expense 



the following table provides reconciliations of our consolidated nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014  





1  on july 17 2015 the distribution date ebay stockholders of record as of the close of business on july 8 2015 received one share of paypal common stock for every share of ebay common stock held as of the record date basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended december 31 2014 was calculated using the number of common shares distributed on the distribution date 

2  the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2015 was based on the number of common shares distributed on july 17 2015 for the period prior to distribution and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period beginning after the distribution date 

in addition to the nongaap measures discussed above we also use free cash flow to assess our operating performance free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment we consider free cash flow to be a key performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment and including investments in our payments platform which can 

then be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and return cash to shareholders a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period   



liquidity and capital resources 

we require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations including customer protection programs our paypal credit products capital expenditures investments in our business potential acquisitions working capital and other cash needs the following table summarizes the cash cash equivalents and investment balances available as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  



1 excludes assets related to customer accounts of 144 billion  and 123 billion  at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively 

2 excludes total restricted cash of 17 million  and 26 million  at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively and cost method investments of   50 million  and 26 million  as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively 

cash cash equivalents and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries ie any entities where earnings would be subject to united states tax upon repatriation were 50 billion as of december 31 2016  and 42 billion at december 31 2015  or 78 and 74 of our total cash cash equivalents and investments as of those dates respectively 

in the second quarter of 2015 we received a contribution of approximately 38 billion of cash from ebay as well as a related estimated deferred tax liability of 236 million associated with foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested in the fourth quarter of 2015 we reassessed the measurement of the deferred tax liability based on updated valuation information and reduced the deferred tax liability balance to 172 million as of december 31 2015 the adjustment to the deferred tax liability was recorded as a contribution from ebay and resulted in an increase to net parent investment within stockholders equity this cash is being used for general corporate purposes in both our international and domestic operations 

in the third quarter of 2015 we entered into a credit agreement “credit agreement” that provides for an unsecured 20 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that includes a 150 million letter of credit subfacility and a 150 million swingline subfacility with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding borrowings and other amounts payable under the credit agreement are guaranteed by paypal inc the “guarantor” we may also subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 500 million subject to specified conditions we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the credit agreement provided that we and the guarantor guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the credit agreement as of december 31 2016  no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at either i the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a margin based on our public debt ratings ranging from 100 percent to 1625 percent or ii a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate the federal funds effective rate or libor plus a margin based on our public debt ratings ranging from zero percent to 0625 percent subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement we and any of our subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow prepay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the credit agreement the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on july 17 2020 unless a the commitments are terminated earlier either at our request or if an event of default occurs by the lenders or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcyrelated events or b the maturity date is extended upon our request subject to the agreement of the lenders the credit agreement contains customary representations warranties affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks the negative 

covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens subject to certain exceptions the financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio based on our public debt ratings 

as of december 31 2016  no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the credit agreement accordingly at december 31 2016  20 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the credit agreement subject to customary conditions to borrowing 

we have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes the arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution “aggregate cash deposits” the arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreedupon limit the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements as of december 31 2016  we had a total of 20 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our 20 billion in aggregate cash deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement 

as of december 31 2016  we were rated investment grade by standard and poors financial services llc and fitch ratings inc we expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance including our capital structure and results of operations our goal is to be rated investment grade but as circumstances change there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading if that were to occur it could increase our borrowing costs including the interest rate on loans under our credit agreement 

the risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual customers merchants and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations in the programs and modifications to the programs resulting from changes to regulatory requirements for the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report our transaction loss rates calculated by dividing transaction loss by tpv ranged between 017 and 018 of tpv historical trends may not be an indication of future results in addition prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts from ebay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible ebay purchases made with paypal these costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with ebays customer protection programs that we administered and funded on behalf of ebay which are included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses following the distribution we no longer administer ebays customer protection programs or recover amounts from ebay associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases instead we and ebay each independently administer our own customer protection programs further our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on ebay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution 

growth in our portfolio of loan receivables originated through paypal credit products increases our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business we continue to evaluate partnerships and thirdparty sources of funding of our credit portfolio including but not limited to commercial banks securitization markets private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds consistent with this strategy in march 2016 as approved by management and our luxembourg banking subsidiary supervisory board and as permitted within regulations set forth by the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” we designated 800 million  of european customer balances held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our european customers these funds are classified as cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet and represent approximately 20  of european customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at december 31 2016  as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the cssf we may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances to be used to extend credit to our european customers if necessary based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal 

in january 2016 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to 2 billion of our common stock with no expiration from the date of authorization this stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and subject to market conditions and other factors may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open market transactions block trades privately negotiated transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives however any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made moreover we may terminate our stock repurchase program at any time without notice during the year ended   december 31 2016  we repurchased approximately 995 million of our common stock 

under our stock repurchase program as of december 31 2016  a total of approximately 10 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 

our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating our financial performance and global credit market conditions as well as a broad range of other factors in addition our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see “risk factors—risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition” and “note 12—commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents availableforsale investments cash expected to be generated from operations and our expected access to capital markets together with potential external funding through thirdparty sources such as commercial banks private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds will be sufficient to fund our operating activities anticipated capital expenditures and paypal credit products for the foreseeable future 

cash flows 

in march 2016 we designated 800 million  of european customer balances held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our european customers we have presented changes in funds receivable and customer accounts as cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the activity underlying our customer accounts which includes purchases of investments maturities and sales of investments and changes in funds receivable and customer accounts we have elected to conform the prior period statement of cash flows to the current period presentation to enhance transparency and provide comparability see “note 1—overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on the effects of the changes on the presentation of our statement of cash flows to our previously reported consolidated statement of cash flows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain noncash expenses timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual transaction losses paid and changes in other assets and liabilities significant noncash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and deferred tax expenses the cash impact from actual transaction losses paid during a period are reflected as a negative impact to changes in other current and noncurrent assets in cash from operating activities the expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our paypal credit products for which the receivable has not been charged off actual charge offs of receivables related to our paypal credit products are reflected as a reduction in changes in principal loans receivable impacting investing activities and thus have no impact on cash from operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 32 billion  in 2016  due primarily to operating income of approximately 16 billion  adjustments for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation including excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation were approximately 11 billion  during 2016  adjustments for noncash expenses related to provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately 11 billion  during 2016  the cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses net 

we generated cash from operating activities of 25 billion  in 2015  due primarily to operating income of approximately 15 billion  adjustments for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation including excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation were approximately 928 million  during 2015  adjustments for noncash expenses 

related to transaction and loan losses were approximately 809 million  during 2015  the cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in working capital primarily related to actual transaction losses paid during the period additional uses of cash impacting cash generated from operating activities include net cash outflows relating to settlement of ebay payables and receivables of approximately 96 million  and increases in accounts receivable of approximately 22 million  

we generated cash from operating activities of 22 billion  in 2014 due primarily to operating income of approximately 13 billion  adjustments for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation including excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation were approximately 774 million  adjustments to noncash expenses for transaction and loan losses were 646 million  the cash generated from operating activities was offset by uses of cash primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses net and changes in other working capital 

cash paid for income taxes in 2016  2015  and 2014  was 48 million  216 million  and 47 million  respectively 

investing activities 

the net cash used in investing activities of 5 billion  in 2016  was due primarily to purchases of available for sale investments of 210 billion  increases in our loan receivable portfolio net of collections originated through our paypal credit products of 15 billion  purchases of property and equipment of 669 million  and net increases in funds receivable from customers and customer accounts of 176 million  including the reclassification of 800 million  of european customer balances held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary as cash and cash equivalents these net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of 184 billion  

the net cash used in investing activities of 8 billion  in 2015  was due primarily to purchases of investments of 216 billion  acquisitions net of cash acquired of 12 billion  increases in our loan receivable portfolio net of collections originated through our paypal credit products of 819 million  and purchases of property and equipment of 722 million  these net cash outflows were offset in part by maturities and sales of investments of 161 billion  and net cash inflows relating to receivables from ebay of 575 million  

the net cash used in investing activities of 29 billion  in 2014  was due primarily to purchases of available for sale investments of 87 billion  increases in our loan receivable portfolio net of collections originated through our paypal credit products of 1 billion  purchases of property and equipment of 492 million  and net cash outflows relating to receivables from ebay of 362 million  these net cash outflows were offset in part by maturities and sales of investments of 78 billion  

financing activities 

the net cash provided by financing activities of 2 billion  in 2016  was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 3 billion  offset in part by the repurchase of 995 million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 

  

the net cash provided by financing activities of 47 billion  in 2015  was due primarily to a contribution of approximately 39 billion  of cash from ebay and increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 16 billion  offset in part by repayments of borrowings from ebay of 862 million  

the net cash provided by financing activities of 13 billion  in 2014  was due primarily to increases in funds payable and amounts due to customers of 13 billion  offset in part by repayments of borrowings from ebay 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment free cash flow was 25 billion  in 2016  an increase of 665 million  from 2015  the increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of 612 million  and lower purchases of property and equipment of 53 million  free cash flow generated during 2016  was used for funding our credit portfolio repurchasing our common stock under our stock repurchase program and general business purposes 

free cash flow was 18 billion  in 2015  an increase of 96 million  from 2014  the increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of 326 million  offset in part by higher purchases of property and equipment of 230 million  free cash flow generated during 2015  was used towards our acquisitions completed in 2015 funding our credit portfolio and general business purposes 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure see “nongaap financial information” for information on how we compute free cash flow and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

effect of exchange rates on cash 

currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on cash and cash equivalents in 2016 the negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015  and 2014  of 44 million  and 26 million  respectively was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the euro 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

future liquidity and obligations 

as of december 31 2016  approximately 288 billion  of unused credit was available to paypal credit account holders compared to 248 billion  of unused credit as of december 31 2015  while this amount represents the total unused credit available we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our paypal credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time in addition the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of paypal credit products based on among other things account usage and customer creditworthiness when a consumer funds a purchase in the us using a paypal credit product issued by a chartered financial institution the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant we subsequently purchase the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and as a result of such purchase bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults although the chartered financial institution continues to own each customer account we own the related receivable excluding participation interests sold and are responsible for all servicing functions related to the account 

we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes changes in our business needs contractual cancellation provisions fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2016  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations 

  



the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows 

 



as well as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early 

as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits net the table does not include 244 million of such noncurrent liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016  

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues no individual quarter in 2016  2015  or 2014  accounted for more than 30 of annual net revenue 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in “note 1 — overview and summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates require regular review and adjustment 

transaction and loan losses 

transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud chargebacks and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances we expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors including total tpv macroeconomic conditions changes to our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our paypal credit products and working capital advances to selected merchant sellers 

we establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchantrelated chargebacks due to nondelivery of goods or services ach returns buyer protection program claims account takeovers and account overdrafts additions to the allowance in the form of provisions are reflected in transaction and loan losses in our consolidated statements of income the allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other actual data received the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances internal factors including experience with similar cases historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 

we also establish an allowance for loans receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our consumer loans receivable and merchant working capital advances increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our consolidated financial statements this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments for our consumer loans receivable the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates “roll rates” roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to 180  days past the payment due date in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off for merchant working capital advances the allowance is primarily based on principal balances forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintagebased loss forecasting model 

the determination of delinquency from current to 180 days past due for principal balances related to merchant working capital advances is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchants expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance on a regular basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable as such actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes 

the allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off the allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances forecasted delinquency rates and recoveries through the use of a vintagebased loss forecasting model increases to the allowance for interest receivable is reflected as a reduction of net revenues in our consolidated statement of income increases to the allowance for fees receivable is recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheet 

we charge off consumer loan receivable balances in the month in which a customer balance becomes 180 days past the payment due date we charge off the merchant receivable when the updated repayment period is 180 days past the original expected repayment period and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days we also charge off the receivable when the updated repayment period is 360 days past the original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification from the bankruptcy courts loans receivable past the payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off with the portion of the reserve related to the interest receivable balance classified as a reduction of revenue 

determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date based on our results for the year ended december 31 2016  an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately 109 million  

accounting for income taxes 

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax laws and regulations our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations to the extent we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors including our historical experience and short range and longrange business forecasts to the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized we record a valuation allowance 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final 

outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

based on our results for the year ended december 31 2016  a onepercentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately 16 million  

loss contingencies 

we are currently involved in various claims legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims litigation or other violation and may revise our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 

revenue recognition 

application of the various accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 

we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist under the financial accounting standards board “fasb” guidance the evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the fasb guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessments we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts we must perform a quantitative impairment test 

under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties using present value techniques of estimated future cash flows or using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue or a similar performance measure 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing funding and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts we seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from changes in interest rates 

as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  approximately 25  and 24  respectively of our total cash and investment portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents   the assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits time deposits and us and foreign government and agency securities we classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers we seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in jurisdictions where we operate equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances we do not pay interest on amounts due to customers 

in the third quarter of 2015 we entered into a 2 billion senior unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020 borrowings under the revolving facility if any bear interest at floating rates as a result we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2016  no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the credit agreement 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loan obligations which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore may lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowances for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net earnings 

a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact  on our financial assets or liabilities at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  

foreign currency risk 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services our cash flow results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities we are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

we have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts please see “note 8—derivative instruments” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we use foreign exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income “aoci” and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts if any is recorded immediately in earnings 

we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 20 at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 341 million  and 321 million  lower respectively if the us dollar strengthened by 20 at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 341 million  and 321 million  higher respectively 

we have an additional foreign exchange management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “other income expense net” which is offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts 

adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 160 million  and 136 million  at december 31 2016  and december 31 2015 respectively without considering the offsetting effect of hedging foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2016  would have positively  impacted income before income taxes by approximately 128 million  resulting in a net negative  impact of approximately 32 million  foreign currency exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2015 would have positively  impacted income before income taxes by approximately 133 million  resulting in a net negative  impact of approximately 3 million  these reasonably possible adverse changes in currency exchange rates of 20 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes as of these dates 

equity price risk 

as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  our cost method investments totaled 50 million  and 26 million  respectively which represented less than 1 of our total cash and investment portfolio and were primarily related to cost method investments in privately held companies as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we did not hold any marketable equity instruments we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent sales and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data

we enable global commerce by providing payment solutions for our approximately 179 million active customer accounts in over 200 markets as of december 31 2015 while providing customers a choice of how they would like to pay or get paid a market is a geographic area or political jurisdiction such as a country territory or protectorate in which we offer our services a country territory or protectorate is identified by a distinct set of laws and regulations an active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products in the past 12 months our gateway products include our payflow payments and certain braintree products a payment gateway links a merchant’s website to that merchant’s processing network and merchant account 

we offer our customers the flexibility to use their account to both purchase and be paid for goods as well as transfer and withdraw funds a consumer can typically fund a purchase using a bank account a paypal account balance a paypal credit account a credit or debit card or other stored value products such as coupons and gift cards our paypal venmo and xoom products also make it safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds to each other including cross border transfers using several of these funding sources we offer merchants an endtoend payments solution that provides authorization and settlement capabilities as well as instant access to funds we help merchants connect with their customers and manage risk paypals aim is to create deeper more relevant relationships with each of its customers we measure the relevance of our products in the lives of our customers and therefore the success of our business through both payment volume and payment transactions payment volume is the value of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products “total payment volume” or “tpv” during 2015 our tpv was approximately 282 billion  representing growth of 20  over 2014 “payment transactions” is the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products during 2015 we processed approximately 49 billion  payment transactions representing growth of 24  over 2014 this translated to 275  payment transactions per active customer account in 2015 this is an increase from 245  payment transactions per active customer account in 2014 payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period 

our payments platform is built to make the existing global financial infrastructure work for people in the digital and mobile age paypal allows people to make seamless transactions between different markets and networks our payments platform connects with financial institutions around the world and allows consumers to make purchases using a broad range of payment methods regardless of where a merchant is located consumers who use our payments platform can engage in crossborder shopping by sending payments in more than 200 markets across the globe and in more than 100 currencies this enables merchants to extend their reach across borders to an expanded customer base 

we generate revenues by charging fees for providing transaction processing and other paymentrelated services primarily based on the volume of activity or tpv processed through our payments platform we also earn revenue by providing value added services to consumers and merchants such as our paypal credit and paydiant products during 2015 we generated revenue of 92 billion  representing growth of 15  over 2014 19 on an foreign currency neutral basis 

our revenue is influenced by among other things consumer spending patterns merchant adoption of payment methods other than traditional credit or debit cards and cash the expansion of multichannel retail the growth of mobile devices and merchant applications on those devices the growth of consumers with access to the internet globally the pace of transition from paperbased forms of payment to digital forms of payment our share of the digital payments market and our ability to innovate new methods of payment that merchants and consumers find to be valuable our strategy is to drive growth by 

 

 

 

 

in line with our strategy to drive growth we focus on the generation of free cash flow free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure defined as cash flow from operations less purchases of property and equipment we consider free cash flow to be a key performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of operating cash flow generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment which can then be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and return cash to shareholders in 2015 we generated 18 billion  in free cash flow this represents an increase of 96 million  from 2014 please refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  nongaap financial information for information on how we compute free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

paypal is a popular form of payment for mobile commerce and our business has grown with the increased adoption of mobile devices we believe that our braintree products strengthen our position in mobile payments and extend our coverage to a new class of retailers who offer their services primarily through mobile applications these products have expanded our footprint with earlier stage merchants our venmo app is a leading mobile application to move money between friends and family using their mobile device with venmo we have a diversified demographic of consumers in april 2015 we completed our acquisition of paydiant to further expand our capabilities in mobile payments using paydiant’s platform our merchant partners can create their own branded wallets to accelerate mobileinstore payments and drive consumer engagement through mobile payments loyalty offers and the prioritization of preferred payment types such as store branded credit cards and gift cards in november 2015 we completed our acquisition of xoom xoom enables consumers to send money pay bills and send mobile phone reloads to family and friends around the world using mobile devices we believe that mobile devices are the bridge between online inapp and instore offerings creating a pathway to a larger addressable market in addition mobile becomes a conduit that facilitates the movement and management of money including remittances consumer lending and persontoperson p2p transactions 

  

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation noncompliance with laws and regulations increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

connecting merchants and consumers 

we operate a proprietary global technology platform that links merchants and consumers around the globe to facilitate the processing of payment transactions allowing us to connect millions of merchants and consumers worldwide our payments platform facilitates an efficient and secure means for merchants to receive payments and a convenient secure way for consumers to make payments we process transactions through our payments platform in more than 200 markets allowing customers to pay and get paid in more than 100 currencies withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 57 currencies and hold balances in their paypal accounts in 26 currencies 

a transaction on our payments platform can involve up to three participants in addition to us a merchant a consumer and the consumer’s funding source provider the following diagram illustrates a typical payment transaction between a consumer and a merchant on our payments platform 

consumers 

we enable consumers to more safely exchange funds with merchants using their paypal digital wallet our digital wallet provides consumers with the ability to draw funds from a variety of their financial resources which may include both “internal” sources of funds ie a paypal account balance or paypal credit account and sources of funds that are “external” to paypal eg bank transfers credit and debit cards or gift cards within one application we generally do not charge consumers to fund or draw from their accounts however we generate revenue from consumers on fees charged to exchange currencies and on interest and fees from consumer loans originated through our paypal credit products 

we value our relationship with our consumers and invest in this relationship we strive to provide efficient customer service account support and protection from loss and to create relevant products as of december 31 2015 over 8000 people in our customer service organization worked to provide our consumers with answers and solutions when and where they need them in over 20 languages we have operations centers around the world including in the us europe asia and south america that strive to provide highquality service and support for our customers we have also developed a number of trust and security programs including paypal’s buyer protection program that provide additional protection to consumers for qualifying purchases by reimbursing the consumer for the full amount of the purchase if a purchased item does not arrive or is significantly different than the seller’s description see revenue sources—protecting merchants and consumers below 

traditional financial institutions often charge fees for basic services provided to their customers and existing alternatives to these financial institutions including services to cash a check or pay a bill can be inconvenient and expensive we focus on providing 

affordable consumer products that democratize the access to and movement of money we believe that managing and moving a consumer’s money should be a right not a privilege through our technology and products we believe we can change the status quo and make digital payments more efficient and accessible we expect p2p transfers to contribute to this strategy we believe that our p2p products have network effects and help to establish relationships with potential paypal users by allowing them to join the payments platform at the time of making or receiving payments which encourages our natural customerdriven growth paypal offers p2p payment solutions through its website its paypal mobile application through venmo a mobile application that enables payment transactions between nonmerchant account holders and through xoom a service enabling payments from customers in the united states to family and friends in a secure fast and costeffective way using their mobile phones or computers xoom offers money transfer services from the united states to 41 countries crossborder bill payment services from the united states to 7 countries and prepaid mobile phone reload services in 25 countries 

we also provide the ability for consumers to receive a line of credit through our paypal credit consumer products consumers access this credit through their paypal account or directly with merchants as of december 31 2015 we have purchased or extended approximately 74 billion  in credit to consumers of which 40 billion  is currently outstanding we currently fund the purchase of paypal credit consumer receivables with international and domestic cash resources our chartered financial institution in luxembourg or an independent chartered financial institution in the us with whom we partner extends credit to the consumer funds the extension of credit at the point of sale “pos” and advances funds to the merchant in the us we subsequently purchase the consumer receivables related to the consumer loans from the independent chartered financial institution with whom we partnered and as a result of that purchase bear the risk of loss on the related consumer receivables less a participation interest held by the independent chartered financial institution as we expand the availability of our credit products we expect to utilize capital from internal and external sources in the second quarter of 2015 we concluded an arrangement with certain investors whereby we sold a participation interest in certain consumer receivables originated by paypal credit we will continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding of our credit portfolio including but not limited to commercial banks securitization markets private equity firms sovereign wealth funds and under certain specific circumstances the use of customer funds for additional information concerning our consumer credit products see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future liquidity and obligations” and “note 9—loans and interest receivable net” to our combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 

merchants 

as commerce continues to transition from the physical world to the digital world and from domestic commerce to global commerce our proprietary payments platform provides opportunities for merchants to grow their businesses we partner with merchants to help them grow and expand their businesses by improving sales conversion providing global reach offering alternative payment methods such as easy integration credit products and mobile capabilities reducing losses through proprietary protection programs and leveraging data analytics we focus on growing merchant acceptance through business development activities and direct relationships with merchants we enable merchants to more safely and simply receive payments from our active customer accounts providing global reach while reducing some of the complexity and friction involved in enabling overseas and crossborder trade for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 45  of our tpv involved a merchant outside of the us and approximately 22  was crossborder ie transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries 

a merchant can typically open a standard paypal account and begin accepting payments through paypal within a few minutes most online or mobile merchants can onboard quickly and are not required to invest in new or specialized hardware our payments platform supports growth with a variety of value added services designed to help businesses of all sizes manage their cash flow invoice clients pay bills and reduce the need for merchants to receive and store sensitive customer financial information for our standard service we do not charge merchants setup or recurring fees a merchant can also integrate with braintree to begin accepting payments with credit or debit cards paypal venmo digital currencies such as bitcoin or other payment solutions with a single integration 

our payment and paypal credit products are designed to help merchants increase the conversion rate of consumer purchases on their websites and mobile applications for example our one touch product allows consumers to authenticate their account during their first one touch purchase this enables them to skip the login process for future payments and turn shopping into a one touch operation with nearinstant authentication with a faster authentication process we believe that fewer customers will abandon a potential transaction before completing it we also provide the ability for merchants to offer and consumers to fund payments via a deferred payment option using our paypal credit consumer products in addition our paypal working capital “ppwc” product provides merchants with a working capital advance which is paid back to paypal through a percentage of a merchant’s sales that paypal processes in 2015 we achieved the milestone of having originated more than 1 billion in working capital advances as of december 31 2015 we had 421 million  paypal working capital advances and fees receivable outstanding our ppwc product allows us to deepen our engagement with our small business customers by offering them additional services for additional information concerning our merchant credit products see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial 

condition and results of operations future liquidity and obligations” and “note 9—loans and interest receivable net” to our combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we value our relationship with merchants and invest in this relationship by providing customer service account support developer advocacy and support and proprietary risk and security solutions in addition to our consumer protection programs we have also developed paypal’s seller protection program this program provides protection to merchants against claims that a transaction was not authorized by the buyer or claims that an item was not received by covering the seller for the full amount of the payment on eligible sales by offering dual buyer and seller protection programs both the consumer and merchant can transact with confidence 

our payments platform and open application programming interfaces “apis” are designed to allow developers to innovate with ease and to offer cutting edge applications to a large ecosystem of merchants and consumers while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information we provide developers with easy to use flexible and powerful tools that are designed to leverage our global reach and payment capabilities our software developer kits “sdks” are specifically focused on the mobile application market and are designed to remove friction by not requiring a redirect to the paypal website or an additional login we are using a true “mobile first” approach to make payments simple and intuitive 

competition 

the global payments industry is highly competitive we compete against businesses in varied industries many of which are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position in other industries or offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer we compete against all forms of payments including credit and debit cards automated clearing house and bank transfers other online payment services mobile payments and offline payment methods including cash and check 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following 

 

for additional information concerning competition and our competitors see item 1a “risk factors substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business” 

paypal seeks to differentiate itself from industry participants on the safety of the transaction our risk management capabilities as well as protection of consumer account details the simplicity provided for digital transactions and being both brand and technology agnostic further unlike traditional fourparty networks or other mobile payment solutions paypal has a direct financial relationship with both its consumers and merchants as a result of our risk management capabilities paypal can provide its customers with protection from fraud and other losses incurred by participants to a transaction 

to compete effectively we will need to continue to expend significant resources in technology and marketing during 2015 paypal incurred 947 million  on product innovation and development and enhancing our infrastructure to ensure our customers have the capabilities they need and want to complete transactions safely and simply further in 2015 we incurred over 900 million related to our efforts to promote our brands through advertising promotions and other strategic initiatives our marketing efforts play an important role in building brand visibility usage and overall preference among consumers at checkout 

our strengths 

our business is built on a strong foundation designed to allow paypal to differentiate itself from our competitors and drive growth 

our competitive capabilities include 

 

in addition to the discussion in this section see “substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business” in “item 1a risk factors” below for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business 

revenue sources 

we earn revenues primarily by processing customer transactions on our payments platform and from other value added services our revenues are classified into the following two categories 

 7 

 

transaction revenues are generated from fees charged to consumers and merchants on the tpv that we enable growth in tpv is also directly impacted by the number of active customer accounts and the payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform in 2015 transaction revenues generated from customers and merchants on ebay’s marketplace who completed a transaction using our products constituted 26  of our net revenues down from 29  in 2014 the decline in percentage of revenues generated from ebay buyers and ebay sellers reflects the growth in adoption of paypal solutions on platforms other than ebay no other source of revenue represented more than 10 of our revenues 

our pricing varies among regions and can be modified for individual merchants through customerspecific agreements which provide merchants with financial incentives and other benefits to issue accept route prioritize and promote our branded products and other payment programs these financial incentives may be based on tpv or other performancebased criteria such as issuance of new payment products increased acceptance of our products launch of new programs or execution of marketing initiatives 

protecting merchants and consumers 

protecting merchants and consumers from loss is imperative to successfully competing in the payments industry trust and security are essential for our customers and paypal invests significantly in providing both merchants and consumers with comprehensive protection the risk to merchants and consumers and their payments partners from fraudulent activities such as account takeover identity theft and counterparty malicious intent is growing our ability to protect both consumers and merchants is based largely on our ability to leverage the data we collect on transactions and our analytical capabilities we believe mobile devices will play an important part in the future of commerce creating the opportunities to make our ecosystem safer for example paypal is able to use location data from mobile devices and growing protection for the mobile operating environment to reduce risk to merchants and consumers 

we enable consumers to make payments safely and simply without sharing sensitive financial information such as credit card or debit card numbers with merchants or other consumers to make payments using paypal consumers need to disclose only their email address or mobile phone number to merchants the accountbased nature of our payments platform helps us to better detect and prevent fraud when funds enter flow through and exit the payments platform because our transactions are tokenized and because payment authorization credentials are separated from account holder information our ongoing investment in systems and processes designed to enhance the safety and security of our products reflects our goal of having paypal recognized as one of the world’s most trusted payments brands 

we provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on substantially all transactions completed through our payments platform except for transactions using our gateway and paydiant products these programs protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty nonperformance our risk management capabilities allow us to provide these protections which are generally much broader than those protections provided by other participants in the payments industry most payments providers do not offer merchant protection in general and those that do so generally do not provide protection of online or card not present transactions as a result merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they had used paypal’s payments services paypal also provides consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accepts claims for 180 days post transaction in the markets that paypal serves this protection is generally consistent with or better than that offered by other payments providers we believe that as a result of these programs consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as described and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer 

our payments platform utilizes a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by third parties we have developed intuitive user interfaces customer tools and transaction processing database and network applications that help enable our users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites and help our customers to utilize our suite of services our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data eases the deployment and operation of largescale global products and services and automates much of the administration of largescale clusters of computers our technology infrastructure has been designed around industrystandard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences we strive to continually improve our technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and to increase efficiency scalability and security 

our payments platform’s architecture enables us to connect parties regardless of whether the transaction is occurring at a traditional physical location online or through a mobile device the payments platform incorporates multiple layers of protection both for continuity purposes and to help address cybersecurity challenges we engage in multiple efforts to protect the payments platform against these challenges including regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities 

intellectual property 

the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks particularly those covering the paypal name patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is critical to our success we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services we have routinely entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to control access to and limit disclosure of our proprietary information 

we pursue the registration of our domain names trademarks and service marks in the us and internationally additionally we have filed us and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology effective trademark copyright patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation and may not be effective in preventing third parties from infringing upon our intellectual property rights we must protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful 

we have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the us and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest 

government regulation 

government regulation impacts key aspects of our business we are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets we operate 

payments regulation  various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in the us and globally in the us several of our subsidiaries hold licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent which among other things subjects those subsidiaries to reporting requirements bonding requirements limitations on the investment of customer funds and inspection by state regulatory agencies outside the us we provide localized versions of our service to customers through various foreign subsidiaries the activities of those nonus entities are or may be supervised by a financial regulatory authority in the jurisdictions in which they operate among other regulatory authorities the luxembourg commission de surveillance du secteur financier the “cssf” the australian securities and investment commission the monetary authority of singapore the reserve bank of india and the central bank of russia have asserted jurisdiction over some or all of our activities in a particular country this list is not exhaustive as there are numerous other regulatory agencies that have or may assert jurisdiction the laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change 

banking agency supervision  we serve our customers in the european union through paypal europe sàrl et cie sca a whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg by the cssf consequently we must comply with rules and regulations of the banking industry including those related to capitalization funds management corporate governance antimoney laundering disclosure reporting and inspection we also are or may be subject to bankingrelated regulations in other countries now or in the future related to our role in the financial industry in addition based on our relationships with our partner financial institutions in the us we are subject to indirect regulation and examination by these financial institutions’ regulators 

consumer financial protection bureau  the consumer financial protection bureau the “cfpb” has significant authority to regulate consumer financial products in the united states including consumer credit deposit payment and similar products the cfpb and other similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions may have broad consumer protection mandates that could result in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and regulations that may affect our business 

antimoney laundering and counter terrorist financing  paypal is subject to antimoney laundering “aml” laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions outside of the us as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities we have implemented a comprehensive aml program designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activity or to do business in countries 

or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets controls “ofac” and equivalent authorities in other countries our aml compliance program is comprised of policies procedures and internal controls including the designation of a compliance officer and is designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks 

interchange fees  interchange fees associated with fourparty payments systems are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions for example in the european union the multilateral interchange fee “mif” regulation which became effective in december 2015 caps credit and debit interchange fees for cards payments and provides for business rules to be complied with by any company dealing with card transactions including paypal as a result the fees that we collect in certain jurisdictions may become the subject of regulatory challenge 

data protection and information security  aspects of our operations or business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the united states the european union and elsewhere for example in the united states we are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the grammleachbliley act that require the maintenance of a written comprehensive information security program and in europe the operations of our luxembourg bank are subject to information safeguarding requirements under the luxembourg banking act among other laws regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection in addition the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in the united states europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux 

anticorruption paypal is subject to applicable anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act in the jurisdictions in which it operates anticorruption laws generally prohibit offering promising giving or authorizing others to give anything of value either directly or indirectly to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage such as to obtain or retain business we have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations 

additional regulatory developments  various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues including virtual currencies identity theft account management guidelines privacy disclosure rules security and marketing that would impact paypal

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion is divided into three sections the first section which begins immediately following this paragraph discusses some of the risks that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition the second section captioned “risks related to the separation and our operation as an independent publicly traded company” discusses some of the risks relating to our separation into an independent publicly traded company the third section captioned “risks related to our common stock” discusses some of the risks relating to an investment in our common stock you should carefully review all of these sections as well as our combined and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report for important information regarding risks that affect us 

risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payments industry may harm our business 

the global payments industry is highly competitive we compete against businesses in varied industries many of which are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position in other industries or offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer as online and offline commerce are increasingly converging the pace of change innovation and disruption is also increasing the global payments industry is rapidly changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny which may negatively affect the competitive landscape we compete against a wide range of businesses with varying roles in all forms of payments including 

 we often partner with many of these businesses 

we also face competition and potential competition from 

 12 

  

some of these payment providers have greater customer bases volume scale resources and market share than we do which may provide significant competitive advantages some of our competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing and other regulatory requirements they may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of products and services and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact our growth we also expect new entrants as well as established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments to offer competitive products and services in the future in addition some merchants provide such services for themselves competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services in certain countries such as germany netherlands and australia electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions with which our products compete 

we compete primarily on the basis of the following 

 

if we are not able to differentiate our business from those of our competitors drive value for our customers or effectively align our resources with our goals and objectives we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitors our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely harm our business 

our operating and financial results come primarily from transactions involving payments made in a reporting period and are therefore subject to fluctuations that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as well as the trading price of our common stock 

our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including as a result of the risks set forth in this “risk factors” section it is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings loss accurately in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance we do not have a backlog and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come primarily from transactions involving payments during that quarter due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock could decline perhaps substantially as a result of the factors described in this paragraph 

global and regional economic conditions could harm our business 

our operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse economic conditions and events have negatively impacted regional and global financial markets in the past and will likely continue to do so from time to time in the future these events and conditions could have a negative and adverse impact on the companies and customers with which we do business in addition financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry significant financial service institution failures new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income credit currency and equity markets adverse impacts to the companies and customers with which we do business the banking system or financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business including a reduction in the volume and prices of transactions on our payments platforms 

if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments particularly developments with respect to mobile payments to provide new and innovative programs products and services the use of our products and our revenues could decline 

rapid significant and disruptive technological changes continue to impact the industries in which we operate including developments in payment card tokenization ecommerce eg social commerce mobile virtual currencies and near field communication and other proximity payment devices such as contactless payments we cannot predict the effects of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge which may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services developing and incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful in addition our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industrywide standards payments networks new laws and regulations resistance to change from consumers or merchants or thirdparty intellectual property rights our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards if we are unable to do so in a timely or costeffective manner our business could be harmed 

for example mobile devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions and payments and a significant and growing portion of our customers access our payments platform through mobile devices we may lose customers if we are not able to continue to meet our customers’ mobile and multiscreen experience expectations the variety of technical and other configurations across different mobile devices and platforms increases the challenges associated with this environment in addition a number of other companies with significant resources and a number of innovative startups have introduced products and services focusing on mobile markets our ability to successfully address the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving market for mobile transactions is crucial to our continued success and any failure to continue to increase the volume of mobile transactions effected through our payments platform could harm our business 

changes in how consumers fund their paypal transactions could harm our business 

we pay significant transaction fees when consumers fund payment transactions using credit cards lower fees when consumers fund payments with debit cards nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts and nominal fees when consumers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance or through our paypal credit products our financial success is highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which our consumers fund payments using credit and debit cards collectively “payment cards” which can significantly increase our costs some of our consumers may prefer to use payment cards especially if these payment cards offer functionality and benefits not associated with the use of their bank accounts some of our offerings including the ability of consumers to make a limited number of “guest” payments without opening a paypal account have a higher rate of payment card funding than our basic product offering an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment cards or in fees associated with our funding mix or other events or developments that make it more difficult or costly for us to fund transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts or existing paypal account balances could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business some of our plans to lower our funding costs including our paypal credit products and enabling consumers to defer payment for a short period of time on some transactions may increase the risk to us of nonpayment by consumers 

our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches 

our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customers’ personal data including financial information in addition a significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their payment card or bank accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us we have built our reputation on the premise that our payments platform offers customers a secure way to make payments an increasing number of organizations including large online and offline merchants and businesses other large internet companies financial institutions and government institutions have disclosed breaches of their information security systems some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks including on portions of their websites or infrastructure for example in may 2014 ebay inc publicly announced that criminals were able to penetrate and steal certain data including user names encrypted user passwords and other nonfinancial user data from certain of ebays marketplaces business unit databases which led to ebay marketplaces requiring a password reset and fewer ebay marketplaces transactions using our paypal services 

  

the techniques used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to our systems our data or customers data disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized until launched against a target unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including among others hacking into the systems or facilities of us or our partners or customers or attempting to fraudulently 

induce our employees partners customers or others into disclosing user names passwords payment card information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems certain efforts may be statesponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources making them even more difficult to detect as a result of our prominence we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches and expect to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections these security measures cannot provide absolute security our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breaches and third parties may be able to access our customers’ personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those systems our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operations result in our systems or services being unavailable result in improper disclosure of data materially harm our reputation and brand result in significant legal and financial exposure lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our products and services and adversely affect our business and results of operations any breaches of network or data security at our partners or customers could have similar effects in addition our customers could have vulnerabilities on their own computer systems that are entirely unrelated to our systems but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to paypal 

in addition under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customers we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses we also expect to expend significant additional resources to protect against security or privacy breaches and may be required to redress problems caused by breaches among other reasons financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the united states and the european union have implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs require us to change our business practices make it more difficult for new customers to join paypal and reduce the ease of use of our products which could harm our business additionally our insurance policies carry low coverage limits which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able to collect fully if at all under these insurance policies 

systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites applications products or services could harm our business 

our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions computer denialofservice and other cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires natural disasters power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other malware or other events our systems also may be subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities in addition as a provider of payments solutions we are subject to increased scrutiny by regulators that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plans and more rigorous testing of such plans this increased scrutiny may be costly and timeconsuming and may divert our resources from other business priorities 

we have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our products and services these events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue a prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability speed or other functionality of our products and services could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers to believe that our systems are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services and could permanently harm our reputation and brands moreover to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their businesses these customers could seek significant compensation or contractual penalties from us for their losses and those claims even if unsuccessful would likely be timeconsuming and costly for us to address and could have other consequences described in this “risk factors” section under the caption “our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breaches” 

our payments platform has suffered significant intermittent unavailability reliability is particularly critical for us because the fulltime availability of our paypal products and services is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumers and merchants for digital and mobile payments we have undertaken certain system upgrades and replatforming efforts designed to improve our reliability and speed these efforts are costly and timeconsuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resources from new features and products and there can be no guarantee that these efforts will succeed because we are a regulated financial institution in certain jurisdictions frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fines and penalties and mandatory and costly changes to our business practices and ultimately could cause us to lose 

existing licenses that we need to operate or prevent or delay us from obtaining additional licenses that we need to expand our business 

we also rely on facilities components and services supplied by third parties including ebay and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these third parties cease to provide the services or facilities we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events 

changes to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our business 

we do not directly access the payment card networks such as visa and mastercard that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards including some types of prepaid cards accordingly we must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services from time to time payment card networks have increased and may increase in the future the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their networks our payment card processors may have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us as well as increase their own fees for processing any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase our operating costs and reduce our operating income 

in addition in some jurisdictions governments have required visa and mastercard to reduce interchange fees or have opened investigations as to whether visa’s or mastercard’s interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law in the united states the federal reserve board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than visa or mastercard previously charged in the european union the multilateral interchange fee “mif” regulation limits credit and debit interchange fees for payments and imposes business rules on card processing services any material reduction in credit or debit card interchange rates in the united states or other markets could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service providers and may subject us to pricing pressure although it would also lower our costs future changes to those regulations could potentially adversely affect our business 

we are required by our processors to comply with payment card network operating rules including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants and we have agreed to reimburse our processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our merchants the payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules from time to time the networks have alleged that various aspects of our business model violate these operating rules if such allegations are not resolved they may result in material fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices that may be costly the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement as a result we could lose our ability to give consumers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged if we are unable to accept payment cards or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so our business would be adversely affected 

we and our payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchants to comply with payment card network operating rules for providing services to merchants any failure to comply with these rules could result in fines we are also subject to fines from payment card networks if we fail to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered “high risk” primarily the sale of certain types of digital content for “high risk” merchants we must either prevent such merchants from using our paypal services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants although the amount of these fines has not been material to date additional fines in the future could become material and could result in a termination of our ability to accept payment cards or require changes in our process for registering new customers which would materially harm our business payment card network rules may also increase the cost of impose restrictions on or otherwise negatively impact the development of our retail pointofsale solutions which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption 

  

failure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transactions bad transactions and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our services 

  

we incur substantial losses due to claims from consumers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchant’s description we seek to recover such losses from the merchant but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay we also incur losses from claims that the consumer did not authorize the purchase from consumer fraud from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments in addition if losses incurred by us related to payment card transactions become excessive they could 

potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment cards for payment which would harm our business our paypal credit products are similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity we have taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings if these measures do not succeed our business could be harmed 

we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar impacts the translation of our net revenues generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar additionally in connection with providing our services in multiple currencies we set our foreign exchange rates twice per day we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set them given that we also hold some corporate and customer funds in nonus currencies our financial results are affected by the translation of these nonus currencies into us dollars we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries while we regularly enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results 

any factors that reduce crossborder trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business 

crossborder trade ie transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries is an important source of our revenue and profits crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues and operating income than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market crossborder trade also represents our primary and in some cases our only presence in certain important markets 

crossborder trade is subject to and may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations in addition the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer are often extremely complicated in the context of crossborder trade the interpretation andor application of such laws could impose additional requirements which may impose conflicting obligations and restrictions on crossborder trade any factors that increase the costs of crossborder trade or restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business 

our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight as well as extensive complex overlapping and frequently changing rules regulations and legal interpretations   

  

our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight for a discussion of how government regulation impacts key aspects of our business please see item i  “business—government regulation” in this annual report on form 10k our business is also subject to laws rules regulations policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which we operate including but not limited to those governing banking credit deposit taking crossborder and domestic money transmission foreign exchange privacy data protection banking secrecy payment services including payment processing and settlement services consumer protection antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us are extensive complex frequently changing and increasing in number and may impose overlapping andor conflicting requirements or obligations 

financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payments industry and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our business our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rules and regulations that may apply to our business 

as we expand and localize our international activities we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate in addition because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to customers worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our customers are required to comply with their laws laws regulating the internet mobile and related technologies outside of the united states often impose different more specific or even conflicting obligations on us  as well as broader liability for example certain transactions that may be permissible in a local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulations of us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” or us antimoney laundering or counterterrorist financing regulations 

any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws and regulations including those discussed in this risk factor may subject us to significant fines penalties  criminal and civil lawsuits forfeiture of significant assets and other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions result in additional compliance and licensure requirements increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operations force us to change our business practices make product or operational changes or delay planned product launches or improvements the foregoing could individually or in the aggregate expose us to significant liability impose significant costs require us to expend substantial resources increase the cost and complexity of compliance damage our brand and business make our products and services less attractive result in the loss of customers limit our ability to grow the business adversely affect our results of operations and harm our reputation the complexity of us federal and state regulatory and enforcement regimes coupled with the global scope of our operations and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in a single event giving rise to a large number of overlapping investigations and legal and regulatory proceedings by multiple government authorities in different jurisdictions   we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations 

payments regulation 

in the united states paypal inc has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in the states where it is required as well as in the district of columbia the us virgin islands and puerto rico this license includes not only the paypal branded products and services in these states but also our venmo branded products and services our subsidiary xoom is also licensed as a money transmitter in certain us states as licensed money transmitters paypal and xoom are subject to restrictions with respect to their investment of customer funds reporting requirements bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies accordingly if we violate these laws or regulations we could be subject to liability andor additional restrictions forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states forced to change our business practices or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose substantial costs 

while we currently allow our consumers with credit cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets we allow customers in only approximately half of those markets including the united states to also receive payments in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds these limitations may affect our ability to grow our business in these markets of the markets whose residents can use our paypal services approximately 30 markets are in member states of the european union we provide our services to customers in the european union through paypal europe sà rl et cie sca “paypal europe” our whollyowned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg accordingly paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure reporting antimoneylaundering capitalization fund management corporate governance privacy data protection information security banking secrecy taxation sanctions or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks in addition european union laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the european union which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage 

in australia we serve our customers through paypal australia pty ltd “paypal australia” which is licensed by the australian securities and investments commission as a provider of a noncash payment product and by the australian prudential regulation authority as a purchased payment facility provider which is a type of authorized depository institution accordingly paypal australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the product disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization privacy corporate governance or other requirements imposed on australian depository institutions 

in many of the other markets in which we do business including canada and a number of markets in asia central america and south america we serve our customers through paypal pte ltd our whollyowned subsidiary that is based in singapore paypal pte ltd is supervised by the monetary authority of singapore and is designated as a holder of a stored value facility and does not hold a remittance license as a result paypal pte ltd is not able to offer outbound remittance payments including donations to charities from singapore and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in singapore in many of the markets other than singapore served by paypal pte ltd it is unclear and uncertain whether our singaporebased service is subject only to singapore law or if it is subject to the application of local laws whether such local laws would require a payment processor like us to be licensed as a payments service bank financial institution or otherwise 

we are also subject to regulation in other markets in which we do business and we have been and expect to continue to be required to apply for various licenses certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where we provide our services there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such licenses even if we were able to obtain such licenses there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses and we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action if we are found to violate disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization corporate governance 

or other requirements of such licenses these factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of our products in certain countries 

in many other countries it may not be clear whether we are required to be licensed as a payment services provider bank financial institution or otherwise in such markets we may rely on local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange in local currency local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through the local bank such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of our services in a given market or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent us from providing any services in a given market 

consumer protection 

we are subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate the financial services sector has been increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny in the us we have been and we expect that we will continue to be required to make additional disclosures to our consumers and to comply with new restrictions and requirements on our activities among other things our services are subject to the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e issued by the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” under such regulations among other things we are required to provide advance disclosure of changes to our services to follow specified error resolution procedures and to reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer additionally even technical violations of these laws can result in assessment of actual damages or statutory damages or penalties of up to 1000 in individual cases or up to 500000 per violation in any class action and treble damages in some instances and we could also be liable for plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees we are subject to and have paid amounts in settlement of lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e or otherwise advance claims for relief relating to our business practices eg that we improperly held consumer funds or otherwise improperly limited consumer accounts 

in january 2012 the cfpb finalized rules under regulation e mandated by the doddfrank act which required us beginning in october 2013 to provide additional disclosures error resolution rights and cancellation rights to us consumers who make international remittance payments in november 2014 the cfpb proposed a new prepaid account rule that would apply to prepaid cards mobile wallets and potentially paypal accounts in december 2014 we became subject to cfpb supervision and examination pursuant to a new regulation that allows the cfpb to supervise all companies including paypal that provide more than one million international remittance transfers per year under the regulation cfpb examiners are now able to examine us for compliance with the remittance transfer rule and other laws and regulations these and other rules promulgated by the cfpb could increase our costs and require us to expend substantial resources and make changes to our business practices 

in may 2015 we entered into a stipulated final judgment and consent order consent order with the cfpb in which we settled regulatory claims arising from paypal credit practices between 2011 and 2015 the consent order included obligations on paypal to pay 15 million in redress to consumers and a 10 million civil monetary penalty and required paypal to make various changes to the paypal credit disclosures and related business practices we continue to cooperate and engage with the cfpb and work to ensure compliance with the consent order which may result in us incurring additional costs associated with compliance or redress 

paypal europe offers its services in european union countries through a “passport” notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other european union member states pursuant to european union directives and has completed the “passport” notification process in all european union member countries the regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of or delay our plans for expanding our business in european union countries in addition the countries that are members of the european union may each have different and potentially inconsistent interpretations of regulations implementing the european union payment services directive which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage the european commission has proposed revisions to the payments services and antimoney laundering directives which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage finally if the assets of paypal europe exceed certain thresholds or if the european central bank ecb determines that paypal europe is a significant supervised entity or that some activity of paypal europe is subject to oversight by the ecb paypal europe or certain of its activities could become directly regulated by the ecb in addition to the luxembourg regulator the commission de surveillance du secteur financier  as our national supervisor which could subject us to additional requirements and would likely increase compliance costs 

antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing 

we are subject to various antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit among other things our involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities we routinely report to the us department of the treasury’s office of foreign assets control ofac on payments we have rejected or blocked pursuant to ofac sanctions regulations and on any possible violations of those regulations in march 2015 we reached a settlement with ofac regarding possible violations arising from our practices between 2009 and 2013 in addition we continue to cooperate with ofac regarding other transactions that could also possibly be in violation of ofac sanctions regulations in addition we continue to cooperate with ofac regarding other transactions that we have selfreported could also possibly be in violation of ofac sanctions regulations subsequent to our march 2015 settlement we have received new subpoenas from ofac seeking additional information about certain of these transactions such selfreported transactions could result in claims or actions against us including litigation injunctions damage awards fines or penalties or require us to change our business practices that could result in a material loss require significant management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business violation of ofac sanctions regulations that ofac determines to be egregious can result in statutory penalties of up to 250000 per transaction for a discussion of our dealings with ofac please see “note 11 commitments and contingencies  litigation and regulatory matters” 

us and other regulators globally continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions many countries in which we operate also have antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations and we have been and continue to be required to make changes to our compliance program in various jurisdictions in response regulators regularly reexamine the transaction volume thresholds at which we must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance 

privacy and protection of user data 

we are subject to a number of laws rules and directives which we refer to as privacy laws relating to the collection use retention security processing and transfer which we refer to as process of personally identifiable information about our customers and employees sometimes called personal data in the countries where we operate much of the personal information that we process especially financial information is regulated by multiple privacy laws and in some cases the privacy laws of multiple jurisdictions in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between or among us our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relationships the european court of justice in the schrems case has ruled that the useu safe harbor framework clauses one compliance method by which companies could transfer personal data regarding citizens of the european union to the united states could no longer be relied upon the potential impact of this ruling is subject to further determination and additional developments including the potential development of a new form of safe harbor framework or a requirement to find alternative bases for the compliant transfer of personal data from the eu to the us paypal inc has not relied on the safe harbor framework for the transfer of eu personal data to the united states rather when our company was a subsidiary of ebay inc we relied on binding corporate rules that permitted such transfers upon separation from ebay we have continued to operate under these same binding corporate rules pending the approval of our application for our own independent binding corporate rules while paypal inc has not relied on the safe harbor framework some of our data processing subsidiaries service providers customers or other business partners do in addition because paypal europe is headquartered in luxembourg and subject to regulation as a bank in that jurisdiction we have relied on the “onestopshop” concept under which luxembourg has been our lead data protection regulator in the eu however a recent european court of justice ruling weltimmo affecting companies that do business in the eu potentially could make us subject to the local data protection laws or regulatory enforcement activities of the various eu member states in which we have established legal entities 

regulatory scrutiny of privacy data protection collection use and sharing of data is increasing on a global basis there is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection laws which continue to develop in ways we cannot predict privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirements complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacy and data protectionrelated laws can result in significant penalties and damage to our brand and business in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy laws may restrict our ability to provide services to our customers a determination that there have been violations of laws of privacy or data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business and reputation 

in addition because of the large number of text messages emails phone calls and other communications we send or make to our customers for various business purposes communicationrelated privacy laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage awards or fines for example under the telephone consumer protection act tcpa in the us plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of 500 per violation whichever is greater and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations we have been and may be subject to lawsuits including classaction lawsuits containing allegations that our business violated the tcpa these lawsuits seek damages including statutory damages and injunctive relief among other remedies given the large number of communications we send to our customers a determination that there have been violations of the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business 

we post on our websites our privacy policies and practices including concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders or privacy data protection information security or consumer protectionrelated privacy laws and regulations in one or more jurisdictions could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions subject us to significant fines penalties judgments and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase the costs and complexity of compliance and adversely affect our business data protection privacy and information security have become the subject of increasing public media and legislative concern if our customers were to reduce their use of our products and services as a result of these concerns our business could be harmed as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches which themselves may result in a violation of these privacy laws 

paypal is not a bank or licensed lender in the united states and relies upon third parties to make loans and provide other products critical to our business 

as paypal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state we rely on a third party chartered financial institution to issue the paypal credit consumer product in the united states and a different chartered financial institution to issue the paypal working capital product in the united states both of these chartered financial institutions are industrial banks chartered by the state of utah in the event of a termination or interruption in the ability of the chartered financial institution that currently issues the paypal credit consumer product in the united states to lend under the paypal credit consumer product our chartered financial institution that issues the paypal working capital product in the us has agreed to take ownership of and originate loans with respect to all consumer accounts nevertheless any termination or interruption of either bank’s ability to lend could result in the inability to originate any new paypal credit or paypal working capital loans in the event of either bank’s inability to lend we would either need to reach a similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or licenses we may be unable to reach a similar agreement with another partner on favorable terms or at all and obtaining a bank charter or lending licenses would be a timeconsuming and costly process and would subject us to additional laws and regulatory requirements which could be burdensome and increase our costs in addition our commercial relationships with third parties which are federally supervised us financial institutions could subject us to examination by their federal banking regulators with respect to certain services that we provide 

our credit products expose us to additional risks 

our paypal credit and paypal working capital products are offered to a wide range of consumers and merchants and the financial success of these products depends on the effective management of the risk related to these products the lender for the paypal credit product extends credit using proprietary segmentation and credit algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumers based on their past purchasing and payment history as well as their credit scores similarly to assess a merchant who wishes to obtain a paypal working capital advance among other indicators the lender applies a proprietary risk model to help predict the merchants ability to repay the working capital advance these risk models may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumptions about the particular consumer or merchant or the economic environment or limited product history among other factors the accuracy of these risk models and the ability of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our paypal credit and paypal working capital products may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes eg bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations competitors’ actions changes in consumer behavior changes in the economic environment and other factors 

like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer credit we face the risk that paypal credit consumer account holders will default on their payment obligation making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential chargeoffs the nonpayment rate among account holders may increase due to among other things changes to underwriting standards worsening economic conditions such as a recession or greater austerity in various countries and high unemployment 

rates account holders who miss payments often fail to repay their loans and account holders who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loans 

  

we purchase receivables related to paypal credit and paypal working capital products if we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a costeffective manner or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized for these purposes our business could be harmed 

our international expansion of our paypal credit product offerings exposes us to additional risks including those discussed below under the risk factor titled “our international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business” 

we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 

we are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts the assets underlying our customer balances we hold on our balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits time deposits corporate debt securities and us and foreign government and agency securities we seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in jurisdictions in which we operate equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances we do not pay interest on amounts due to customers 

in addition fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income 

in july 2015 we entered into a revolving credit facility as a result we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings under the facility which bear interest at a floating rate 

changes to our buyer and seller protection programs could increase our loss rate 

  

our buyer and seller protection programs protect merchants and consumers from fraudulent transactions in 2015 we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital goods and intangible goods and services in addition consumers who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card issuer usually a bank which in turn will seek recovery from us the risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual buyers sellers and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations to these programs modifications to these programs resulting from changes in regulatory requirements or changes that we decide to implement such as expanding the scope of transactions covered by one or more of these programs upon paypal becoming an independent publiclytraded company on july 17 2015 through the distribution of 100 percent of the outstanding capital stock of paypal to ebay’s stockholders which we refer to as the distribution we extended our protection programs in several countries to cover certain customers’ purchases on ebay and our costs associated with these programs have therefore increased increases in our loss rate including as a result of changing our buyer and seller protection programs could harm our business 

our international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business 

our international operations especially in european union countries in particular united kingdom and germany and china have generated approximately onehalf of our net revenues in recent years in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets and the foreign currency risks discussed earlier in this “risk factors” section under the caption “we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates” there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 22 

 

violations of the complex foreign and us laws rules and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws violations by our employees contractors or agents could nevertheless occur these risks are inherent in our international operations and expansion may increase our costs of doing business internationally and could harm our business 

use of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our business 

our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses including money laundering terrorist financing illegal online gambling fraudulent sales of goods or services illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances piracy of software movies music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods in particular digital goods money laundering bank fraud child pornography trafficking prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products online securities fraud or to facilitate other illegal activity certain activity that may be legal in one country may be illegal in another country and a merchant may intentionally or inadvertently be found responsible for importing illegal goods creating liability to us changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional paymentsrelated proposals are under active consideration by government authorities intellectual property rights owners or government authorities may seek to bring legal action against providers of payments solutions including paypal that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items any resulting claims could result in reputational harm and any resulting liabilities loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business 

our failure to manage the assets underlying our customer funds properly could harm our business 

our ability to manage and account accurately for the assets underlying our customer funds requires a high level of internal controls as our business continues to grow and we expand our product offerings we must continue to strengthen our associated internal controls our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds any failure to maintain the necessary controls or to manage the assets underlying our customer funds accurately could result in reputational harm lead customers to discontinue or reduce their use of our products and result in significant penalties and fines which could harm our business 

we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws 

we are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under us and foreign laws and regulations including antitrust and competition laws an increasing number of jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the united states individual states other countries or the european commission or otherwise constitute unfair competition an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities including increased scrutiny in large markets such as china our business agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation some regulators particularly those outside of the 

united states may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive any claims or investigations even if without foundation may be very expensive to defend or respond to involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices 

we are subject to patent litigation 

we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties’ patents at any given time we are typically a defendant in a number of patent lawsuits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes we expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because among other reasons 

 

such claims may be brought directly against us andor against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter we believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been and continue to be initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims in addition we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries patent claims whether meritorious or not are timeconsuming and costly to defend and resolve and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings or cease conducting certain operations which would harm our business 

we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 

we believe the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is critical to our success we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the united states and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business 

effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available and contractual arrangements and other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others we must protect our intellectual property rights including our trademarks patents copyrights domain names trade dress trade secrets and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions a process that is expensive and timeconsuming we may not be successful in protecting or enforcing our rights in every jurisdiction also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could materially harm our business 

as the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of the outcome any such claim with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert management’s time and attention from our business and require us to among other things stop providing transaction processing and other payment related services or redesign stop selling our products or services pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with certain parties with whom we have commercial relationships our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters may harm our business 

we are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory disputes and government inquiries 

we are regularly subject to claims lawsuits including class actions and individual lawsuits government and regulatory investigations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust law intellectual property privacy data protection information security consumer protection accessibility claims securities tax labor and employment commercial disputes services escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property and other matters in particular our business faces ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation as discussed above the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger our business has expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products and services have increased in complexity in addition the laws rules and regulations affecting our business including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce payments services and credit are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws rules and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations of those laws rules and regulations 

the scope outcome and impact of claims lawsuits government investigations and proceedings that we are subject to cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that is subject to management’s judgment resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceedings could potentially require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings any of which could materially and adversely affect our business these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could materially and adversely affect our business 

certain of our customer agreements contain arbitration provisions with class action waiver provisions that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provisions or the class action waiver provisions in them in the future or in any given case legislative administrative or regulatory developments may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of predispute arbitration clauses and class action waiver provisions any such prohibitions or limitations on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provisions could subject us to additional lawsuits including additional consumer class action litigation or materially impact our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world including with respect to our tax structure any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient 

in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of losses in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items 

in light of continuing global fiscal challenges various levels of government and international organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and european union eu are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue these tax reform efforts are designed to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory actions to increase tax revenue could increase our effective tax rate 

we and our merchants may be subject to sales reporting and recordkeeping obligations 

one or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose reporting or recordkeeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax 

compliance and legislation to such effect has been contemplated by several additional states and is in the process of being implemented by a number of foreign jurisdictions or if one of our companies was deemed to be the legal agent of our merchants by a jurisdiction in which it operates we have modified our software to meet these requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our customer experience in connection with complying with these reporting obligations any failure by us to comply with these and similar reporting and recordkeeping obligations could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our business 

acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business 

we have acquired a significant number of businesses technologies services and products we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses technologies services products and other assets as well as strategic investments and joint ventures these transactions may involve significant challenges and risks including 

 

at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any of these transactions could individually or in the aggregate be material to our financial condition and results of operations it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt and increased interest expense liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or writeoffs of goodwill which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders 

we may make certain investments including through joint ventures in which we have a minority equity interest andor lack management and operational control under such circumstances the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling investor joint venture partner or joint venture company may result in reputational harm or adversely affect the value of our investment 

we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our services 

companies providing online services may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through their services including claims alleging defamation libel breach of contract invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement among other things the laws relating to the liability of companies providing online services for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the united states and foreign jurisdictions we are also subject to potential liability to third parties for the customerprovided content on our sites particularly in jurisdictions outside the united states where the applicable laws are unsettled if we become liable for information provided by our customers and carried on our service we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings which could harm our business 

problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our customers could harm our business 

a number of third parties provide services to us or to our customers as discussed in this risk factors section under the caption “changes to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our business” we are dependent on banks and other payment processors that link us to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions we rely on unaffiliated third party lenders to make the consumer and other loans originated through the paypal credit and paypal working capital products we also rely heavily on third parties to operate our services including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions and third parties that provide loan receivable tracking and customer statements processing financial or regulatory issues labor issues or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our customers could harm our business we have outsourced certain functions to thirdparty providers including some customer support and product development functions which are critical to our operations if our service providers do not perform satisfactorily our operations could be disrupted which could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business 

price increases or financial penalties by or service terminations disruptions or interruptions at companies that provide services to us and our customers and clients could also make it more difficult for our merchants to complete transactions thereby harming our business some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint in addition there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our customers will continue to do so on acceptable terms or at all if any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our customers on acceptable terms including as a result of bankruptcy we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 

our developer platforms which are open to merchants and thirdparty developers subject us to additional risks 

we provide thirdparty developers with access to application programming interfaces software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use with a particular focus on mobile applications there can be no assurance that merchants or thirdparty developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all and a number of factors could cause such thirdparty developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms in addition our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions it is possible that merchants and thirdparty developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations which could harm our business 

our retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks 

we have announced several retail point of sale solutions which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to or otherwise communicating with a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile device’s embedded camera and which enable consumers to use their mobile devices to pay at the point of sale as we continue to expand our product and service offerings at the retail point of sale we will face additional risks including 

 27 

 

unless we are able to successfully manage these risks including driving adoption of and significant volume through our retail point of sale solutions over time our business may be harmed 

our success largely depends on key personnel because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our business 

our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including engineering and product development personnel and our ability to attract retain and motivate such personnel competition for key personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley where our corporate headquarters are located and we may be unable to successfully attract integrate or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel in making employment decisions particularly in hightechnology and payments industries job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment and fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to attract retain and motivate employees in addition we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any “key person” life insurance policies the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our business 

risks related to the separation and our operation as an independent publicly traded company 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation 

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation of paypal from ebay inc which we refer to as the separation or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all the separation and distribution were expected to provide the following benefits among others enhanced strategic and management focus better ability to form strategic relationships faster decisionmaking more efficient allocation of capital alignment of incentives with performance objectives direct access to the capital markets and a distinct investment identity if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation or if such benefits are delayed our business could be harmed 

  

if the distribution together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the internal revenue code the “code” ebaypaypal and ebay stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ebay for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

ebay received an opinion from its outside legal counsel regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code the opinion was based on and relied on among other things certain facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of ebay and paypal including those relating to the past and future conduct of ebay and paypal if any of these representations statements or undertakings are or become inaccurate or incomplete or if ebay or paypal breach any of their respective covenants in the separation documents the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution together with certain related transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction if the irs determines that any of these representations assumptions or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the irs disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel an opinion of counsel is not binding on the irs or any court and there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion the irs did not provide any opinion in advance of the separation that our proposed transaction will be taxfree 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code in general ebay would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the paypal common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value ebay stockholders who received paypal common stock in the distribution may be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares and we could incur significant liabilities 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capitalraising transactions following the separation in addition we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capitalraising transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to ebay of the separation and the distribution under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with ebay for a period of time following the distribution we are generally prohibited from taking certain actions that prevent the distribution and related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 368a1d and 355 of the code these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we or our stockholders might consider desirable or may present us from engaging in certain capitalraising transactions 

we have no history of operating as an independent publicly traded company in our current form and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results 

the combined and consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of ebay and do not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate independent publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below 

 other significant changes may occur in our cost structure management financing and business operations as a result of operating as an independent company separate from ebay for additional information please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k 

ebay remains a significant source of our revenues after the distribution 

after the distribution we continue to derive a significant amount of revenues and operating income from ebay if the operating agreement expires or is terminated prior to its expiration or if there is a significant change in our relationship with ebay including if ebay becomes a merchant of record eliminates or modifies any of its risk management or customer protection programs directs transactions to a different provider of payment services or offers ebay customers more payment options our business could be materially harmed 

ebay may fail to perform under various agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transaction agreements expire 

in connection with the separation we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with ebay as well as various other agreements including an operating agreement colocation services agreements transition services agreements a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement an intellectual property matters agreement a data sharing addendum and a product development agreement the separation agreement the tax matters agreement the employee matters agreement and the intellectual property matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities including by means of licensing between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the operating agreement the colocation services agreements and the data sharing addendum establish certain commercial relationships between ebay and us related to payment processing credit information technology infrastructure and data sharing the transition services agreements provide for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited period of time after the separation if we or ebay is unable to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements including its respective indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties or losses or be required to make substantial indemnification or other payments to ebay if we do not have in place our own systems and services or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once these transaction agreements expire or terminate we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our financial condition and result of operations may be adversely affected 

after the separation certain of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at ebay 

because of their current or former positions with ebay certain of our directors own ebay common stock and equity awards following the separation even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent some of our directors continue to have a financial interest in ebay common stock and equity awards in addition one of our directors continues to serve on the ebay board of directors continuing ownership of ebay common stock and equity awards or service as a director at both companies could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest if paypal and ebay were to have disagreements about the agreements between them or face decisions that could have different implications for paypal and ebay 

risks related to our common stock 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

paypal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by paypal’s stockholders which could discourage lawsuits against paypal and paypal’s directors and officers 

paypal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the corporation otherwise determines the state courts of the state of delaware or if no state court located in the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of paypal any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer of paypal to paypal or paypal’s stockholders creditors or other constituents any action asserting a claim against paypal or any director or officer of paypal arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law dgcl or paypal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or any action asserting a claim against paypal or any director or officer of paypal governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of paypal’s stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with paypal or paypal’s directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against paypal and paypal’s directors and officers alternatively if a court outside of delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above paypal could incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect paypal’s business financial condition or results of operations 

certain provisions in paypal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or delay an acquisition of paypal which could decrease the trading price of paypal common stock 

paypal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that may have the effect of deterring coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and by encouraging prospective acquirers to negotiate with paypal’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 

   

paypal has also elected not to be governed by section 203 of the dgcl which provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with a person that acquires more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock paypal’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation however contains a provision that generally mirrors section 203 of the dgcl except that it provides for a 20 threshold instead of the 15 provided for by the dgcl these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that paypal’s stockholders may favor 

certain of the above provisions were added pursuant to the agreement between ebay inc and certain entities under the control of carl c icahn these provisions are not intended to make paypal immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition that paypal’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of paypal and paypal’s stockholders these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition an acquisition or further issuance of paypal’s stock including preferred stock could trigger the application of section 355e of the code for a discussion of section 355e see “material us federal income tax consequences” in our registration statement on form 10 as amended filed with the securities and exchange commission under the tax matters agreement in such circumstances paypal would be required to indemnify ebay for any resulting taxes which could materially and adversely affect us moreover this indemnity obligation might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that paypal’s stockholders may consider favorable please refer to “certain relationships and related person transactions” and “description of paypal’s capital stock” in our registration statement on form 10 as amended filed with the securities and exchange commission for a more detailed description of these agreements and provisions

the separation from ebay 

on september 30 2014 ebay inc “ebay” announced its intent to separate its payments business into an independent publiclytraded company to accomplish this separation in january 2015 ebay incorporated paypal holdings inc “paypal holdings” which is now the parent of paypal inc and holds directly or indirectly all of the assets and liabilities associated with paypal inc in june 2015 the board of directors of ebay approved the separation the separation of ebays payments business through the distribution the distribution of 100 of the outstanding common stock of paypal to ebays stockholders paypal holdings registration statement on form 10 as amended was declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission on june 29 2015 on july 17 2015 the distribution date paypal holdings became an independent publiclytraded company through the pro rata distribution by ebay of 100 of the outstanding common stock of paypal holdings to ebay stockholders each ebay stockholder of record as of the close of business on july 8 2015 received one share of paypal holdings common stock for every share of ebay common stock held on the record date approximately 12 billion shares of paypal holdings common stock were distributed on july 17 2015 to ebay stockholders paypal holdings common stock began regular way trading under the ticker symbol pypl on the nasdaq stock market on july 20 2015

overview 

net revenues increased   12 billion  or 15  in 2015  and 13 billion  or 19  in 2014  the increase was primarily driven by growth in total payment volume “tpv” of 20  in 2015  and 26  in 2014  operating expenses increased   1 billion  and 11 billion  or 15  and 20  in 2015  and 2014  respectively the increase in 2015 was primarily due to an increase in transaction expense customer support and operations expense and transaction and loan losses the increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in transaction expense higher expenses due to additional sales and marketing programs and product development initiatives and an increase in transaction and loan losses 

operating income increased   193 million  or 15  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 177 million  or 16  in 2014  compared to 2013  nongaap operating income increased   327 million  or 20  in 2015  compared to 2014  and 237 million  or 17  in 2014  compared to 2013  our nongaap operating margin was 21  in 2015  2014  and 2013  operating income and nongaap operating income increased in 2015  and 2014  primarily as a result of higher net revenues partially offset by increased operating expenses 

we recorded net income of 12 billion  in 2015  419 million  in 2014  and 955 million  in 2013  the increase  in net income in 2015  compared to 2014 was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income of 193 million  and a decrease  in income tax expense of 582 million  primarily resulting from the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in 2014 relating to undistributed foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years the decrease in net income in 2014 compared to 2013 also was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities in 2014 relating to undistributed foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years which resulted in an increase in income tax expense in 2014 we recorded nongaap net income of 16 billion  in 2015  13 billion  in 2014  and 12 billion  in 2013  the increase in nongaap net income in 2015  and 2014  was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income in each of these periods our diluted net income per share was 100  in 2015  034  in 2014  and 078  in 2013  our nongaap diluted net income per share was 129  in 2015  110  in 2014  and 097  in 2013  

we generated net cash flows from operations of 25 billion  in 2015 compared to 22 billion  and 20 billion  in 2014 and 2013 respectively we generated free cash flow of 18 billion  17 billion  and 16 billion  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively

business environment 

we are a leading technology platform company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide we believe in providing simple affordable secure and reliable financial services and digital payments to help our customers around the world to achieve their financial goals we strive to increase our relevance for consumers merchants friends and family to access and move their money anywhere in the world anytime on any platform and through any device eg mobile tablets personal computers or wearables we provide safer and simpler ways for businesses of all sizes to accept payments from merchant websites mobile devices and applications and at offline retail locations through a wide range of payment solutions we also facilitate person to person payments through paypal venmo and xoom acquired in november 2015 our combined payment solution capabilities including our paypal paypal credit braintree venmo and xoom products comprise our proprietary payments platform 

we provide merchants and consumers with protection programs on substantially all transactions completed through our payments platform except for transactions using our gateway and paydiant products our gateway products include our payflow payments and certain braintree products a payment gateway links a merchants website to their processing network and merchant account these programs protect both merchants and consumers from loss primarily due to fraud and counterparty nonperformance our risk management capabilities allow us to provide these protections which are generally much broader than those protections provided by other participants in the payments industry most payments providers do not offer merchant protection in general and those that do so generally do not provide protection of online or card not present transactions as a result merchants may incur losses for chargebacks and other claims on certain transactions when using other payments providers that they would not incur if they had used paypal’s payments services paypal also provides consumer protection against losses on qualifying purchases and accepts claims for 180 days post transaction in the markets that paypal serves this protection is generally consistent with or better than that offered by other payments providers we believe that as a result of these programs consumers can be confident that they will only be required to pay if they receive the product in the condition as described and merchants can be confident that they will receive payment for the product that they are delivering to the customer 

our payments platform and open application programming interfaces “apis” are designed to allow developers to innovate with ease and to offer cutting edge applications to a large ecosystem of merchants and consumers while at the same time maintaining the security of our customers’ financial information we provide developers with easy to use flexible and powerful tools that are designed to leverage our global reach and payment capabilities our software developer kits “sdks” are specifically focused on the mobile application market and are designed to remove friction by not requiring a redirect to paypalcom or an additional login we are using a true “mobile first” approach to make payments simple and intuitive 

information security risks for global payments and technology companies have significantly increased in recent years although we have not experienced any material impacts relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches on our payments platform there can be no assurance that we are immune to these risks and will not suffer such losses in the future see “risk factorsrisk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial conditionour business is subject to online security risks including security and privacy breaches” 

we operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry that focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing antimoney laundering privacy and consumer protection some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently and the laws and regulations applicable to us including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation noncompliance with laws and regulations increased penalties and enforcement actions related to noncompliance changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation and the enactment of new laws and regulations applicable to us could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and financial condition therefore we monitor these areas closely to ensure compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us 

impact of foreign currency rates 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the us dollar we generated approximately 50 of our 2015  net revenues 52 of our 2014  net revenues and 52 of our 2013  net revenues from merchants or consumers domiciled outside of the united states other than the united states the united kingdom was the only country where we generated more than 10 of total net revenues in 2015  2014  and 2013  during each of these periods we have also generated more than 10 of total net revenues in the euro zone because we have generated substantial net revenues internationally in recent periods including 2015 2014 and 2013 we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries as discussed under “risk factors—risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition” 

we calculate the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts while changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results we have a foreign exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges to help minimize the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings in 2015  foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately 345 million  inclusive of a 182 million favorable impact from hedging activities and favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately 310 million in 2014  foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar negatively impacted net revenues by approximately 58 million inclusive of a 36 million negative impact from hedging activities and favorably impacted operating expenses by approximately 55 million while we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact on earnings from foreign currency rate movements it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure 

additionally in connection with our services in multiple currencies we set our foreign exchange rates twice per day and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign exchange rates given that we also have foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries we have an additional foreign exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “other income expense net” which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts these foreign exchange contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities 

financial results 

net revenues 

revenue description 

we earn revenue primarily by processing customer transactions on our payments platform and from other value added services our revenues are classified into the following two categories 

  

 transaction revenues are generated from fees charged to consumers and merchants on the volume of activity we enable “total payments volume” or “tpv” we define tpv as the value of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products growth in tpv is also directly impacted by the payment transactions that we enable on our payments platform payment transactions are the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products we earn additional fees on transactions settled in foreign currencies when we enable crossborder transactions ie transactions where the merchant or consumer were in different countries 

our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following 

  

 net revenues analysis 

the significant components of our net revenue for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were as follows 



net revenues from transaction revenues increased by 10 billion  or 14  in 2015 compared to 2014 net revenues from transaction revenues increased by 11 billion or 19 in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in transaction revenues in 2015  and 2014 was due primarily to the growth in tpv and the growth in total number of payment transactions on our payments platform acquisitions were not material to total transaction revenue growth in 2015 or 2014 the impact of increases or decreases in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact revenue growth in 2015  or 2014  

the following table provides a summary of our active customer accounts number of payment transactions tpv and related metrics 



1  an active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products in the past 12 months 

2  payment transactions are the total number of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products 

3  number of payment transactions per active customer account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period divided by active customer accounts at the end of the period 

4  total payment volume or “tpv” is the value of payments net of payment reversals successfully completed through our payments platform excluding transactions processed through our gateway and paydiant products 

 all amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest millions except as otherwise noted as a result certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided 

 not meaningful 

the growth in tpv of 20  in 2015 and 26  in 2014 was driven by growth in active accounts a higher number of payment transactions driven by the increase in engagement from our customers and growth from our braintree and venmo products tpv growth in 2015 was negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the us dollar the growth in transaction revenues was lower than the growth in tpv and growth in payment transactions in 2015 and 2014 due to a higher portion of tpv generated by large merchants who generally pay lower rates on higher transaction volume and a lower mix of crossborder transactions the percent of tpv generated by large merchants increased four percentage points in 2015 and three percentage points in 2014 crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market 

net revenues from other value added services increased by 202 million  or 22  in 2015 compared to 2014 net revenues from other value added services increased by 183 million  or 25  in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in net revenues from other value added services in 2015 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from consumers and merchants that used our paypal credit products revenue share earned under our credit program agreement with synchrony financial formerly ge capital retail bank and the gain on sale of a participation interest in certain consumer loans receivable that we purchased as described further below the increase in net revenues from other value added services in 2014 was due primarily to interest and fee income earned on loans receivable outstanding from consumers and merchants that used our paypal credit products 

in the third quarter of 2015 we amended the terms of our credit program agreement with synchrony financial as a result of the amendment we recognized 78 million of additional revenue under the agreement during 2015 in addition as part of the amended agreement our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with synchrony financial was terminated we retain an option to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term 

in the second quarter of 2015 we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold participation interests in certain consumer loans and interest receivable related to our paypal credit products with a gross book value of approximately 708 million  as a result of the arrangement the impact to net revenues from other value added services during 2015 was a net decrease of 35 million compared to 2014 due to the reduction in net revenues earned from interest and fees on the participation interests sold partially offset by the gain recognized on the sale of the participation interest inclusive of the gain of 26 million recognized on the initial sale of approximately 708 million in certain consumer loans receivable and servicing fees 

operating expenses 

the following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trend in each

not meaningfu l 

transaction expense 

transaction expense is primarily comprised of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment these costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners for processing and disbursement costs to enable a transaction and interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable arising from our paypal credit funding option we refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix” the cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally more costly than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a paypal account balance or paypal credit as we expand the availability of alternative funding sources to our customers a change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate the cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the us than in the us for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  approximately 45 48 and 48 of tpv respectively was generated outside of the us 

transaction expense increased 440 million  or 20  in 2015 compared to 2014 the increases in transaction expense in 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in tpv offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations due to the strengthening of the us dollar transaction expense increased by 335 million  or 18  in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to an increase in tpv the impact from acquisitions was not material to our total transaction expense growth in 2015 or 2014 

our transaction expense rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to higher assessments charged by payments processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card bank account or other funding sources partially offset by cost efficiencies from our payments platform and a favorable funding mix our transaction expense rates in 2014 decreased compared to 2013 due to cost efficiencies from our payments platform a favorable funding mix and a larger share of tpv in countries where we pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards than in the us interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance our portfolio of loans receivable included in transaction expense was 3 million 7 million and 14 million for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

transaction and loan losses 

transaction losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud and chargebacks loan losses include the losses associated with our loans receivable balances we expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors including tpv macroeconomic conditions the extent of our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our paypal credit products and working capital advances to selected merchant sellers additionally prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts 

from ebay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible ebay purchases made with paypal these costs include the actual amount of protection losses associated with ebays customer protection programs that we administer and fund on behalf of ebay which are included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses recoveries associated with protection losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  were 27 million  43 million  and 48 million  respectively following the distribution we no longer administer ebays customer protection programs or recover amounts from ebay associated with protection losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases instead we and ebay each independently administer our own customer protection programs further our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on ebay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur related incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution 

transaction and loan losses increased 163 million  or 25  in 2015  compared to 2014  and increased 144 million  or 29  in 2014  compared to 2013  transaction losses were 511 million  in 2015  408 million  in 2014  and 310 million  in 2013  reflecting an increase  of 25  in 2015 compared to 2014 and an increase  of 32  in 2014 compared to 2013 the increase in each of these periods was predominately attributable to higher tpv our transaction loss rate in 2015 increased compared to 2014 due to lower recoveries in 2015 associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases offset by improved consumer loss performance and a higher provision in the prior year from actual losses incurred our transaction loss rate in 2014 increased compared to 2013 due to a higher provision in 2014 from actual losses incurred 

loan losses relating to our loans receivable portfolio were 298 million in 2015  238 million in 2014  and 192 million in 2013  reflecting an increase of 25 in 2015  compared to 2014  and an increase of 23 in 2014  compared to 2013  the increase in loan losses in both 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to growth in the portfolio of loans receivable outstanding arising from consumers who chose paypal credit as a funding option and an increase in working capital advances to selected merchant sellers 

the total consumer loans receivable balance as of december 31 2015  and 2014  was 40 billion  and 37 billion  respectively reflecting a year over year increase  of 8  in 2015 including the sale of additional participation interests to certain investors in the second quarter of 2015 the following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our pool of us consumer loans and interest receivable balance 



we offer credit products to certain existing small and mediumsized merchants through our paypal working capital product 

the total paypal working capital advances and fees receivable merchant receivables outstanding as of december 31 2015  and 2014  was 421 million  and 103 million  respectively reflecting a year over year increase of 309  to assess a merchant seeking a paypal working capital advance we use among other indicators a risk model that we have internally developed that we refer to as our paypal working capital risk model “prm” as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchants ability to repay the principal balance and fixed fee related to the working capital advance the prm uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchants ability to repay a working capital advance drivers of the model include the merchants annual payment volume and payment processing history with paypal prior repayment history with the paypal working capital product and other measures merchants are assigned a prm credit score within the range of 350  to 750  we generally expect that merchants to which we extend a working capital advance will have prm scores greater than 525  we generally consider scores above 610  to be very good and to pose limited credit risk we assess a participating merchant’s prm score on a recurring basis at december 31 2015  and 2014  the weighted average prm score related to our paypal working capital balances outstanding was 630  and 622  respectively 

the determination of delinquency for merchant receivables is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchants expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance on a monthly basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable as such actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to provide support to our business including legal human resources finance executive and other support operations our legal expenses including those related to ongoing legal proceedings case settlements and judgments and regulatory proceedings and fines may fluctuate substantially from period to period

restructuring 

in january 2015 at a regular meeting of ebay’s board of directors the “ebay board” the ebay board approved a plan to implement a strategic reduction of its existing global workforce the reduction was completed by the end of 2015 primarily impacting sales and marketing and product development expenses restructuring expenses were 48 million  in 2015 no restructuring expenses were recognized in 2014 or 2013 

income tax expense

nongaap financial information 

nongaap financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts that are different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” pursuant to the requirements of regulation sk portions of this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” include a reconciliation of certain nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures the presentation of nongaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 

we present nongaap financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of our ongoing operating results and to facilitate meaningful comparison of our results between periods management uses these nongaap financial measures to among other things evaluate our ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performancebased compensation 

we exclude the following items from nongaap net income nongaap net income per diluted share nongaap operating income nongaap operating margin and nongaap effective tax rate 

  

 44 

measures primarily because they are noncash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results the related employer payroll taxes is dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of exercises by employees of their stock options and the vesting of their restricted stock over which management has limited to no control and as such management does not believe it correlates to the operation of our business 

 

  



1  on july 17 2015 the distribution date ebay stockholders of record as of the close of business on july 8 2015 received one  share of paypal common stock for every share of ebay common stock held as of the record date basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 was calculated using the number of common shares distributed on july 17 2015 

2  basic and diluted net income per share for the year ended december 31 2015 was calculated using the number of common shares distributed on july 17 2015 for periods prior to distribution 

in addition to the nongaap measures discussed above we also use free cash flow to assess our operating performance free cash flow represents cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment we consider free cash flow to be a key performance measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment and including investments in our payments platform which can then be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and return cash to shareholders a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period   



liquidity and capital resources 

we require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations including customer protection programs our paypal credit products capital expenditures investments in our business potential acquisitions working capital and other cash needs the following table summarizes the cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investment balances available as of december 31 2015  and 2014  

  



1 excludes assets related to customer accounts of 123 billion  and 106 billion  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investments held by our foreign subsidiaries ie any entities where earnings would be subject to united states tax upon repatriation were 42 billion as of december 31 2015  and 20 billion at december 31 2014  or 74 and 90 of our total cash cash equivalents and availableforsale investments as of those dates respectively during the first quarter of 2014 ebay changed its capital allocation strategy to reflect its objective of increasing its available us cash preserving its credit rating and providing greater liquidity to meet its other cash needs in the us including potential merger and acquisition activity and funding opportunistic share repurchases on an accelerated basis as a result of the change in ebay’s capital allocation strategy we provided for us income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on 19 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our nonus subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years we recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately 650 million based on the estimated tax consequences of repatriating these earnings we did not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on 23 billion of our nonus subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings as of december 31 2015  since we do not know the time or manner in which we may repatriate those funds we cannot determine the impact of local taxes withholding taxes and foreign tax credits associated with the future repatriation of such earnings and therefore cannot quantify the tax liability 

in the second quarter of 2015 we received a contribution of approximately 38 billion of cash from ebay as well as a related estimated deferred tax liability of 236 million associated with the foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested in the fourth quarter of 2015 we reassessed the measurement of the deferred tax liability based on updated valuation information and reduced the deferred tax liability balance to 172 million as of december 31 2015 the adjustment to the deferred tax liability was recorded as a contribution from ebay and resulted in an increase to net parent investment within stockholders equity this cash is being used for general corporate purposes in both our international and domestic operations 

in the third quarter of 2015 we entered into a credit agreement credit agreement that provides for an unsecured 20 billion fiveyear revolving credit facility that includes a 150 million letter of credit subfacility and a 150 million swingline subfacility with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time borrowings and other amounts payable under the credit agreement are guaranteed by paypal inc the guarantor we may also subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to 500 million subject to specified conditions we may designate one or more of our subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the credit agreement provided that we and the guarantor guarantee all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the credit agreement as of december 31 2015  no subsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  

as of december 31 2015  no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the credit agreement accordingly at december 31 2015  20 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the credit agreement 

loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at either i the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a margin based on our public debt ratings ranging from 100 percent to 1625 percent or ii a formula based on the agent bank’s prime rate the federal funds effective rate or libor plus a margin based on our public debt ratings ranging from zero percent to 0625 percent subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement we and any of our subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow prepay and reborrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the credit agreement the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on july 17 2020 unless a the commitments are terminated earlier either at our request or if an event of default occurs by the lenders or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcyrelated events or b the maturity date is extended upon our request  subject to the agreement of the lenders the credit agreement contains customary representations warranties affirmative and negative covenants including financial covenants events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks the negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens subject to certain exceptions the financial covenants require us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio based on our public debt ratings 

we have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes the arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution “aggregate cash deposits” the arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreedupon limit the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements as of december 31 2015  we had a total of 20 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our 20 billion in aggregate cash deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement 

as of december 31 2015  we were rated investment grade by standard and poors financial services llc and fitch ratings inc we expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance now that we have separated from ebay including our capital structure and results of operations our goal is to be rated investment grade but as circumstances change there are factors that could drive the long term credit ratings both down and up if that were to occur it could increase our borrowing costs including the interest rate on loans under our credit agreement 

the risk of losses from our customer protection programs are specific to individual customers merchants and transactions and may also be impacted by regional variations in these programs and modifications to the program resulting from changes to regulatory requirements for the periods presented in these combined and consolidated financial statements included in this report payments under these customer protection programs have ranged between 008 and 012 of tpv historical trends may not be an indication of future results in addition prior to the distribution we recovered certain amounts from ebay related to customer protection programs offered on eligible ebay purchases made with paypal these costs included the actual amount of protection losses associated with ebays customer protection programs that we administered and funded on behalf of ebay which are included as a reduction of transaction and loan losses following the distribution we no longer administer ebays customer protection programs or recover amounts from ebay associated with transaction losses incurred on eligible ebay purchases instead we and ebay each independently administer our own customer protection programs further our customer protection programs extend to customers’ eligible purchases on ebay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental costs associated with our customer protection programs following the distribution 

we currently fund the purchase of the paypal credit consumer receivables with international and domestic cash resources to the extent that our paypal credit products become more widely available and as we further promote paypal credit customer adoption and usage of such products may expand any resulting growth in the portfolio of loan receivables would increase our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business in the second quarter of 2015 we completed an arrangement with certain investors under which we sold a participation interest in certain consumer loan and interest receivables related to our paypal credit products with a gross book value of approximately 708 million the sale resulted in cash proceeds of approximately 710 million of which 692 million related to the outstanding principal and 18 million related to the interest receivable we will continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding of our credit portfolio including but not limited to commercial banks securitization markets private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds and under certain specific circumstances the use of customer funds our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal we believe that our access to the capital markets and funds that may be available from other third party sources together with cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our paypal credit products for the foreseeable future 

in the second quarter of 2014 we agreed subject to certain conditions that we one of our affiliates or a designated third party would purchase a portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of our credit program agreement with synchrony financial formerly ge capital retail bank for a price based on the book value of the consumer loan receivables portfolio at the time of the purchase expected to be october 2016 subject to certain adjustments and exclusions in the third quarter of 2015 we amended and extended the existing credit card program agreement on new terms as part of the amended agreement our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of the credit program agreement with synchrony financial was terminated we retain an option to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term 

in january 2016 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to 2 billion of our common stock with no expiration from the date of authorization this stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and subject to market conditions and other factors may also be used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program may be made through open market transactions block trades privately negotiated transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives however any stock repurchases are subject to market conditions and other uncertainties and we cannot predict if or when any stock repurchases will be made moreover we may terminate our stock repurchase program at any time without notice 

our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating our financial performance and global credit market conditions as well as a broad range of other factors in addition our liquidity access to capital and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party see “risk factors—risk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition” and “note 11—commitments and contingencies” to the combined and consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business 

we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents availableforsale investments cash expected to be generated from operations and our expected access to capital markets together with potential external funding through third party sources such as commercial banks private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds will be sufficient to fund our operating activities anticipated capital expenditures and paypal credit products for the foreseeable future 

cash flows 



operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain noncash expenses timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual transaction losses paid and changes in other assets and liabilities significant noncash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and deferred tax expenses the expenses recognized for provision for transaction losses are estimates of the transaction losses incurred during the period but for which cash has not been paid the cash impact from actual transaction losses paid during a period are reflected as a negative impact to changes in other current and noncurrent assets in cash from operating activities the expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our paypal credit products for which the receivable has not been charged off actual charge offs of receivables related to our paypal credit products are reflected as a reduction in changes in principal loans receivable impacting investing activities and thus have no impact on cash from operating activities 

we generated cash from operating activities of 25 billion  in 2015 due primarily to operating income of approximately 15 billion  adjustments for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation including excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation were approximately 928 million  during 2015 adjustments for noncash expenses related to transaction and loan losses were approximately 809 million  during 2015 the cash generated from operating activities was offset by uses of cash from increases in working capital primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses net additional uses of cash impacting cash generated from operating activities include net cash outflows relating to settlement of ebay payables and receivables of approximately 96 million  and increases in accounts receivable of approximately 22 million  

we generated cash from operating activities of 22 billion  in 2014 and 20 billion  in 2013 due primarily to operating income of 13 billion  in 2014 and 11 billion  in 2013 adjustments for noncash expenses of depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation including excess tax benefits from stockbased compensation were approximately 774 million  during 2014 and 630 million  during 2013 adjustments for noncash expenses for transaction and loan losses were 646 million  during 2014 and 502 million  during 2013 the cash generated from operating activities was offset by uses of cash primarily related to transaction loss allowance for cash losses net and changes in other working capital 

cash paid for income taxes in 2015  2014  and 2013  was 216 million  47 million  and 28 million  respectively 

investing activities 

the net cash used in investing activities of 64 billion  in 2015 was due primarily to purchases of available for sale investments of 75 billion  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 12 billion  increases in our loan receivable portfolio net of collections originated through our paypal credit products of 819 million  and purchases of property and equipment of 722 million  due in part to the separation from ebay these net cash outflows were offset by maturities and sales of investments of 33 billion  and net cash inflows relating to receivables from ebay of 575 million  

the net cash used in investing activities of 15 billion  in 2014 was due primarily to increases in our loan receivable portfolio net of collections originated through our paypal credit products of 10 billion  purchases of property and equipment of 492 million  and net cash outflows relating to receivables from ebay of 362 million  offset by and net cash received for maturities and sales of investments of 409 million  

the net cash used in investing activities of 17 billion  in 2013 was due primarily to increases in our loan receivable portfolio net of collections and chargeoffs originated through our paypal credit products of 793 million  cash paid for acquisitions net of cash acquired of 731 million  purchases of investments of 610 million  and purchases of property and equipment of 391 million  offset by net cash inflows relating to receivables from ebay of 484 million  and cash received for maturities and sales of investments of 320 million  

financing activities 

the net cash provided by financing activities of 31 billion  in 2015 was due primarily to a contribution of approximately 39 billion  of cash from ebay offset by repayments of borrowings from ebay of 862 million  

the net cash used in financing activities of 51 million  in 2014 and 85 million  in 2013 was due primarily to net cash outflows relating to repayments of borrowings from ebay 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment free cash flow was 18 billion  in 2015 an increase of 96 million  from 2014 the increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of 326 million  offset by higher purchases of property and equipment of 230 million  free cash flow generated during 2015 was used for general business purposes and towards our acquisitions completed in 2015 

free cash flow was 17 billion in 2014 an increase of 126 million from 2013 the increase in free cash flow during the period was primarily due to higher cash generated from operating activities of 227 million offset by higher purchases of property and equipment of 101 million free cash flow generated during 2014 was used to fund our increase in loans to consumers and merchants 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure see nongaap financial information for information on how we compute free cash flow and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 

effect of exchange rates on cash 

the negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2015  and 2014  of 44 million  and 26 million  respectively was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies primarily the euro there was minimal impact of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2013  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our combined and consolidated financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

future liquidity and obligations 

as of december 31 2015  approximately 248 billion  of unused credit was available to paypal credit account holders while this amount represents the total unused credit available we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our paypal credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time in addition the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered financial institution that is the issuer of paypal credit products based on among other things account usage and customer creditworthiness when a consumer funds a purchase in the us using a paypal credit product issued by a chartered financial institution the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant we subsequently purchase the receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the chartered financial institution and as a result of such purchase bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults although the chartered financial institution continues 

to own each customer account we own the related receivable excluding participation interests sold and are responsible for all servicing functions related to the account 

we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes changes in our business needs contractual cancellation provisions fluctuating interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments the following table summarizes our obligations as of december 31 2015  that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods we believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations 

  



the significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows 

 

 as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits net the table does not include 288 million of such noncurrent liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015  

seasonality 

the company does not experience meaningful seasonality no individual quarter in 2015  2014  or 2013  accounted for more than 30 of net revenue 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved and b the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors our significant accounting policies including recent accounting pronouncements are described in note 1  overview and summary of significant accounting policies to the combined and consolidated annual financial statements 

a quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors the amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability for all of these estimates it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted and estimates require regular review and adjustment 

transaction and loan losses 

transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs fraud chargebacks and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances we expect our transaction and loan losses to fluctuate depending on many factors including the total tpv macroeconomic conditions the extent of our customer protection programs the impact of regulatory changes and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our paypal credit products and working capital advances to selected merchant sellers 

we establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchantrelated chargebacks due to nondelivery of goods or services ach returns buyer protection program claims account takeovers and account overdrafts additions to the allowance in the form of provisions are reflected in transaction and loan losses in our combined and consolidated statements of income the allowances which involve the use of actuarial techniques are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claims data reported by our claims processors and other actual data received the allowances are based on known facts and circumstances internal factors including experience with similar cases historical trends involving loss payment patterns and the mix of transaction and loss types 

we also establish an allowance for loans receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our consumer loans receivable and merchant working capital advances increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses in our combined and consolidated financial statements this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments and is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates “roll rates” roll rates represent the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment roll rates are applied to principal balances for each stage of delinquency from current to 180 days past due in order to estimate the principal loans which have incurred a loss event and are probable to be charged off 

the determination of delinquency from current to 180 days past due for principal balances related to merchant working capital advances is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee as compared to the original expected repayment period we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchants expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within 9 to 12 months from the date of the advance on a monthly basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable as such actual repayment periods are dependent on actual payment processing volumes 

the allowance for loss against the interest and fees receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off 

we charge off loans receivable balances in the month in which the customer balance becomes 180 days past due bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days of receiving notification from the bankruptcy courts past due loans receivable continue to accrue interest until such time as they are charged off with the portion of the reserve related to interest receivable balance classified as a reduction of revenue 

determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date based on our results for the year ended december 31 2015  an aggregate ten percentage increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately 81 million 

accounting for income taxes 

our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax laws and regulations our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations to the extent we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings 

deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors including our historical experience and short range and longrange business forecasts to the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized we record a valuation allowance 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

based on our results for the year ended december 31 2015  a onepercentage point increase in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase in the provision of approximately 15 million 

loss contingencies 

we are currently involved in various claims legal proceedings and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities we regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings the merits of our defenses and consultation with inhouse and outside legal counsel because of uncertainties related to these matters accruals are based only on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims litigation or other violation and may revise our estimates due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 

revenue recognition 

application of the various accounting principles in us gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized 

valuation of goodwill and intangibles 

the valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuations require the use of management’s assumptions which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur 

we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist under the financial accounting standards board “fasb” guidance the evaluation of indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment allows for qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the fasb guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessments we consider relevant events and conditions including but not limited to macroeconomic trends industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors companyspecific events legal and regulatory factors and our market capitalization previously assessed under ebay if the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts we must perform a quantitative impairment test 

under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the combined and consolidated statement of income measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties using present value techniques of estimated future cash flows or using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue or a similar performance measure 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies governing our investing funding and foreign currency derivative activities in order to mitigate market risks we monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interestrate sensitive assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our condensed combined and consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts we seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from changes in interest rates 

as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  approximately 24  and 97  of our total cash and investment portfolio was held in cash and cash equivalents   the proportionate decrease was primarily driven by an increase in availableforsale investments of 43 billion for 2015 prior to the separation paypal participated in ebay inc’s cash pooling arrangement and had limited availableforsale investment activity as part of the capitalization we received from ebay a cash contribution of approximately 38 billion which was used to purchase availableforsale investments we held no direct investments in auction rate securities collateralized debt obligations structured investment vehicles or mortgagebacked securities in any periods presented for additional details related to our investment activities please see “note 5—investments” to the combined and consolidated financial statements included in this report 

the assets underlying the customer balances we hold on our combined and consolidated balance sheet as customer accounts are maintained in interest and noninterest bearing bank deposits time deposits and us and foreign government and agency securities we classify the assets underlying the customer balances as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill our direct obligation under amounts due to customers we seek to preserve principal while holding eligible liquid assets as defined by applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in jurisdictions where we operate equal to at least 100 of the aggregate amount of all customer balances we do not pay interest on amounts due to customers 

in the third quarter of 2015 we entered into a 2 billion senior unsecured credit facility maturing in 2020 borrowings under the revolving facility if any bear interest at floating rates as a result we will be exposed to fluctuations in interest rates to the extent of our borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2015  no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the credit agreement 

interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage credit card and other consumer loans which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies chargeoffs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net earnings 

a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities as of december 31 2015  and 2014 

foreign currency risk 

we have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services our cash flow results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities we are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies 

we have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported combined and consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts please see “note 7—derivative instruments” to the combined and consolidated financial statements included in this report 

we use foreign exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts if any is recorded immediately in earnings 

we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 20 at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 321 million and 294 million lower respectively if the us dollar strengthened by 20 at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign exchange forward contracts before taxes would have been approximately 321 million and 294 million higher respectively 

we have an additional foreign exchange management program whereby we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries these contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in “other income expense net” which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts 

adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 136 million and 32 million at december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively without considering the offsetting effect of hedging foreign exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2015  would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 133 million resulting in a net negative impact of approximately 3 million foreign exchange contracts in place as of december 31 2014  would have positively impacted income before income taxes by approximately 34 million resulting in a net positive impact of approximately 2 million these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term 

equity price risk 

as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  our cost and equity method investments totaled 26 million  and 31 million  respectively which represented less than 1 of our total cash and investment portfolio and were primarily related to cost method investments in privately held companies we did not hold any marketable equity instruments we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent sales and acquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data 

european debt exposures 

  

we actively monitor our exposure to the european markets including the impact of sovereign debt issues associated with cyprus greece ireland italy portugal and spain as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  we did not have any direct investments in the sovereign debt of these countries or in debt securities issued by corporations or financial institutions organized in these countries we maintain a small number of operating bank accounts with local and foreign banks in the aforementioned countries that have balances that we do not consider material
