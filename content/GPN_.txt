credit and debit card transaction processing 

credit and debit card transaction processing includes the processing of the worlds major international card brands including american express discover card discover jcb mastercard unionpay international and visa as well as certain domestic debit networks such as interac in canada credit and debit networks establish uniform regulations that govern much of the payment card industry during a typical payment transaction the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other but instead rely on payments technology companies such as global payments to facilitate transaction processing services including authorization electronic draft capture file transfers to facilitate funds settlement and certain exceptionbased back office support services such as chargeback resolution 

we process funds settlement under two models a sponsorship model and a direct membership model under the sponsorship model member clearing financial institutions members sponsor us and require our adherence to the standards of the networks in these markets we have sponsorship or depository and clearing agreements with financial institution sponsors these agreements allow us to route transactions under the members control and identification numbers to clear card transactions through mastercard and visa in this model the standards of the card networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds and instead require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant has been funded 

under the direct membership model we are direct members in various payment networks allowing us to process and fund transactions without thirdparty sponsorship under this model we route and clear transactions directly through the card brand’s network and are not restricted from performing funds settlement otherwise we process these transactions similarly to how we process transactions in the sponsorship model we are required to adhere to the standards of the various networks in which we are direct members we maintain relationships with financial institutions which may also serve as our member sponsors for other card brands or in other markets to assist with funds settlement 

how a card transaction works 

a typical payment transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location where the card information is captured by a pointofsale pos terminal card reader or mobile device card reader which may be sold or leased to the merchant and serviced by us alternatively card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device or ecommerce portal by one of a number of services that we offer directly or through a valueadded reseller the card reader electronically records sales draft information such as the card identification number transaction date and transaction amount 

after the card and transaction information is captured the pos device automatically connects to our network through the internet or other communication channel in order to receive authorization of the transaction for a credit card transaction authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction amount will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits in a debit card transaction we obtain authorization for the transaction from the card issuer through the payment network verifying that the cardholder has access to sufficient funds for the transaction amount 

as an illustration shown below in the sponsorship model on a 10000 card transaction the card issuer may fund the member our sponsor indirectly through the card network 9850 after retaining approximately 150 referred to as an interchange fee the card issuer seeks reimbursement of 10000 from the cardholder in the cardholders monthly credit card statement the member would in turn pay the merchant 10000 the net settlement after this transaction would require us to advance the member 150 after the end of the month we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction amount or merchant discount to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our fee from the transaction if our discount rate for the merchant in the above example was 200 we would bill the merchant 200 after the end of the month for the transaction reimburse ourselves for 150 in interchange fees and retain 050 as our fees for the transaction under some arrangements we remit the net amount of 9800 to the merchant rather than funding the full 10000 and subsequently billing the merchant at the end of the month discount rates vary based on negotiations with merchants and the economic characteristics of transactions interchange rates also vary based on the economic characteristics of individual transactions accordingly our fee per transaction varies across our merchant base and is subject to change based on changes in discount rates and interchange rates our profit on the transaction reflects the fee received less payment network fees and operating expenses including systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or iso payment network fees are charged by the card brands in part based on the value of transactions processed through their networks 

issuer solutions segment 

through our issuer solutions segment we provide solutions that enable financial institutions and other financial service providers to manage their card portfolios reduce technical complexity and overhead and offer a seamless experience for cardholders on a single platform in addition we provide flexible commercial payments and epayables solutions that support b2b payment processes for businesses and governments we also offer complementary services including account management and servicing fraud solution services analytics and business intelligence cards statements and correspondence customer contact solutions and risk management solutions 

issuer solutions segment revenues are derived from longterm processing contracts with financial institutions and other financial services providers payment processing services revenues are generated primarily from charges based on the number of accounts on file transactions and authorizations processed statements generated andor mailed managed services cards embossed and mailed and other processing services for cardholder accounts on file most of these contracts 

have prescribed annual minimums penalties for early termination and service level agreements that may affect contractual fees if specific service levels are not achieved issuer solutions segment revenues also include loyalty redemption services and professional services 

business and consumer solutions segment 

our business and consumer solutions segment provides general purpose reloadable gpr prepaid debit and payroll cards demand deposit accounts and other financial service solutions to the underbanked and other consumers and businesses in the united states and parts of europe through our netspend® and other brands through our business and consumer solutions segment we provide customers with access to depository accounts insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic with a menu of features specifically tailored to their needs the business and consumer solutions segment has an extensive distribution and reload network comprised of financial service centers and other retail locations throughout the united states and is a program manager for fdicinsured depository institutions that provide the services that the business and consumer solutions segment develops promotes and distributes business and consumer solutions currently has active agreements with four card issuing banks additionally our business and consumer solutions segment provides b2b payment services and softwareasaservice “saas” offerings that automate key procurement processes including invoice capture coding and approval and enable virtual cards and integrated payments options across a variety of key vertical markets 

the business and consumer solutions segment markets its services through multiple distribution channels including alternative financial service providers traditional retailers directtoconsumer and online marketing programs and contractual relationships with corporate employers business and consumer solutions segment revenues principally consist of fees collected from cardholders and fees generated by cardholder activity in connection with the programs that we manage customers are typically charged a fee for each purchase transaction made using their cards unless the customer is on a monthly or annual service plan in which case the customer is instead charged a monthly or annual subscription fee as applicable customers are also charged a monthly maintenance fee after a specified period of inactivity we also charge fees associated with additional services offered in connection with programs we manage including the use of overdraft features a variety of bill payment options card replacement foreign exchange and cardtocard transfers of funds initiated through our call centers revenues are recognized net of fees charged by the payment networks for services they provide in processing transactions routed through them we have recently commenced a strategic evaluation of the consumer portion of this segment with the intent to focus on our growing b2b portfolio 

competition 

our merchant solutions segment competes with financial institutions merchant acquirers and other financial technology companies who provide businesses with merchant acquiring services and related services as of december 31 2021 we believe that we were one of the largest merchant acquirers in the small and mediumsized business segment merchants who have less than 5 million in annual bankcard sales volume in the united states in the united states we compete primarily with fiserv inc and its alliances fiserv fidelity national information services inc fis chase paymentech solutions llc elavon inc a subsidiary of us bancorp wells fargo bank na and block inc formerly known as square inc while these are our primary competitors our vertically focused business in the united states competes with other organizations advances in technology are also enabling new entrants some of which depart from traditional payment models 

internationally financial institutions remain the primary providers of payment technology services to merchants although the outsourcing of these services to thirdparty service providers is becoming more prevalent in addition to financial institutions competitors in europe include ayden nv and fis we expect competition to continue to increase as new companies enter our markets and existing competitors expand or consolidate their product lines and services 

our issuer solutions segment encounters competition from other thirdparty payment card processors the card brands core banking platform providers independent software vendors and various other firms that provide products and services to payment card issuers in the markets we serve the united states market for thirdparty issuer processing is primarily serviced by three vendors including tsys as of december 31 2021 we believe that we were the largest thirdparty processor for credit card issuers in north america and one of the largest in europe based on net revenue from solutions provided to credit card issuers 

our business and consumer solutions segment primarily competes with other demand deposit account and prepaid debit account program managers to provide financial service solutions to the underbanked and other consumers and businesses our primary competitors in this space include green dot corporation incomm fiserv and chime as of 

december 31 2021 we believe that we were one of the two largest prepaid program managers in the united states based on gross dollar volume total spending on the accounts we manage processed

doddfrank act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act restricts the amounts of debit card fees that certain institutions can charge merchants pursuant to regulations promulgated by the federal reserve board debit interchange rates for card issuers with assets of 10 billion or more are capped at 021 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuers fraud losses plus for qualifying issuers an additional 001 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs 

in addition the doddfrank act limits the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions because it allows merchants to i set minimum dollar amounts not to exceed 10 for the acceptance of a credit card and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and ii provide discounts or incentives to encourage consumers to pay with cash checks debit cards or credit cards 

the rules also contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions that require a card issuer to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements and restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements the prohibition on network exclusivity has not significantly affected our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our customers nor do we expect it to in the future 

the doddfrank act also created the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws and the financial stability oversight council which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company such as us should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve on the ground that it is systemically important to the us financial system accordingly we may be subject to additional systemic riskrelated oversight

in order to provide our services we process and store sensitive business and personal information which may include credit and debit card numbers bank account numbers social security numbers driver’s license numbers names and addresses and other types of personal information or sensitive business information some of this information is also processed and stored by financial institutions merchants and other entities as well as thirdparty service providers to whom we outsource certain functions and other agents which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties we may have responsibility to the card networks financial institutions and in some instances our merchants isos andor individuals for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties as applicable to protect this information 

we are a regular target of malicious thirdparty attempts to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities andor penetrate or bypass our security measures in order to gain unauthorized access to our networks and systems or those of our associated third parties such access could lead to the compromise of sensitive business personal or confidential information as a result we follow a defenseindepth model for cybersecurity meaning we proactively seek to employ multiple methods at different layers to defend our systems against intrusion and attack and to protect the data we collect however we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful or will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats 

our computer systems andor our associated third parties’ computer systems could be subject to penetration and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect and continually evolve and become more sophisticated threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties including statesponsored organizations with significant financial and technological resources computer viruses and other malware can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service ransomware or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities our defensive measures may not prevent downtime unauthorized access or use of sensitive data while we maintain first and thirdparty insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses companies we acquire may require postclosing implementation of additional cyber defense methods to align with our standards and as a result there may be a period of increased risk between the closing of an acquisition and the completion of such implementation further certain of our thirdparty relationships are subject to our vendor management program and governed by written contracts however we do not control the actions of our associated third parties and any problems experienced by these third parties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in the services provided by such parties or cyberattacks and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to service our customers or otherwise conduct our business 

in addition we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to use security and privacy that we impose on our associated third parties who have access to this data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the misuse of this data any misuse or compromise of personal information or failure to adequately enforce these contractual requirements could result in liability protracted and costly litigation and with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers lost revenue and reputational harm 

any type of security breach attack or misuse of data described above or otherwise whether experienced by us or an associated third party could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services or from making digital payments generally increase our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the incident expose us to unanticipated or uninsured liability disrupt our operations including potential service interruptions distract our management increase our risk of litigation or regulatory scrutiny result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state federal and foreign laws or by the card networks and adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial 

institution sponsorship our removal from networks lists of payment card industry data security standard compliant service providers could mean that existing customers sales partners or other third parties may cease using or referring our services also prospective merchant customers financial institutions sales partners or other third parties may choose to terminate negotiations with us or delay or choose not to consider us for their processing needs in addition the card networks could refuse to allow us to process through their networks 

we may experience software defects undetected errors and development delays which could damage customer relations decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability 

our services are based on software and computing systems that often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software services and errors or delays in our processing of digital transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation and exposure to liability claims in addition we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our systems or our thirdparty providers systems may fail which could interrupt our service cause us to lose business increase our costs and expose us to liability 

we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems software data centers and telecommunications networks as well as the systems and services of third parties a system outage or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows not only could we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss but we may also be liable to third parties many of our contractual agreements with financial institutions and certain other customers require the payment of penalties if we do not meet certain operating standards our systems and operations or those of our thirdparty providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from among other things fire climaterelated events including extreme weather events natural disasters pandemics power loss telecommunications failure terrorist acts war unauthorized entry human error and computer viruses or other defects defects in our systems or those of third parties errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions telecommunications failures or other difficulties including those related to system relocation could result in loss of revenues loss of customers loss of merchant and cardholder data harm to our business or reputation exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities negative publicity additional operating and development costs fines and other sanctions imposed by card networks andor diversion of technical and other resources there is also a risk that thirdparty suppliers of hardware and infrastructure required to support our employee productivity or our vendors could be affected by supply chain disruptions such as manufacturing and shipping delays an extended supply chain disruption could also affect the delivery of our services 

the payments technology industry is highly competitive and highly innovative and some of our competitors have greater financial and operational resources than we do which may give them an advantage with respect to the pricing of services offered to customers and the ability to develop new and disruptive technologies 

we operate in the payments technology industry which is highly competitive and highly innovative in this industry our primary competitors include other independent payment processors credit card processing firms thirdparty card processing software institutions as well as financial institutions isos prepaid programs managers and potentially card networks some of our current and potential competitors may be larger than we are and have greater financial and operational resources or brand recognition than we have our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a direct member for participation in the card networks as we do in certain jurisdictions and may be able to settle transactions more quickly for merchants than we can these financial institutions may also provide payment processing services to merchants at a loss in order to generate banking fees from the merchants it is also possible that larger financial institutions including some who are customers of ours could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide these attributes may provide them with a competitive advantage in the market 

furthermore we are facing increasing competition from nontraditional competitors including new entrant technology companies who offer certain innovations in payment methods some of these competitors utilize proprietary software and service solutions some of these nontraditional competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers in addition some nontraditional competitors such as private companies or startup companies may be less risk averse than we are and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to market demands these competitors may compete in ways that minimize or remove the role of traditional card networks acquirers issuers and processors in the digital payments process if these nontraditional competitors gain a greater share of total digital payments transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally the market for prepaid cards demand deposit accounts and alternative financial services is similarly highly competitive and competition is increasing as more companies endeavor to address the needs of underbanked consumers we anticipate increased competition from alternative financial services providers who are often well positioned to service the underbanked and who may wish to develop their own prepaid card or demand deposit account programs we also face strong price competition to stay competitive we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our distributors and reduce the prices of our services which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and cash flows 

in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings we must continually and quickly update our services a process that could result in higher costs and the loss of revenues earnings and customers if the new services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 

the payments technology industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in a number of projects including the development of new platforms mobile payment applications ecommerce services and other new offerings emerging in the payments technology industry these projects carry the risks associated with any development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance problems in the payments technology markets these risks are even more acute any delay in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate our services could render our services less desirable to customers or possibly even obsolete furthermore as the market for alternative payment processing services evolves it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new services targeted at this market 

in addition certain of the services we deliver to the payments technology market are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions all at very high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies as a result of these factors our development efforts could result in higher costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenues and earnings if promised new services are not delivered timely to our customers or do not perform as anticipated 

our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa and mastercard are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registrations financial institution sponsorship and in some cases continued membership in certain card networks 

  

in order to provide our visa and mastercard transaction processing services we must be either a direct member or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of visa and mastercard respectively registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of each organization in certain jurisdictions if our sponsor financial institution in any market should stop providing sponsorship for us we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers and potential customers in that market which would negatively affect our revenues earnings and cash flows furthermore some agreements with our financial institution sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants our sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in connection with direct membership the rules and regulations of various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would limit our use of capital for other purposes 

the termination of our registration or any changes in the visa or mastercard rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing visa and mastercard payment processing services which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale the rules of the card networks may be influenced by card issuers and some of those issuers also provide acquiring services and are our competitors or our customers in both the merchant solutions and issuer solutions segments if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks the card networks could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations or membership the termination of our registrations or our membership or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows if a merchant or an iso customer fails to comply with the applicable 

requirements of the card associations and networks we or the merchant or iso could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks if we cannot collect or pursue collection of such amounts from the applicable merchant or iso we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties resulting in lower earnings for us 

our business and consumer solutions segment relies on certain relationships with issuing banks distributors marketers and brand partners the loss of such relationships or if we are unable to maintain such relationships on terms that are favorable to us may materially adversely affect our business financial position operating results and cash flows 

our business and consumer solutions segment relies on arrangements that we have with issuing banks to provide us with critical products and services including the fdicinsured depository accounts tied to the cards and accounts we manage access to the atm networks membership in the card associations and network organizations and other banking services the majority of our active business and consumer solutions cards and accounts are issued or opened through meta payment systems metabank if any material adverse event were to affect metabanks or another of our critical issuing banks or we were to lose metabank or another critical bank or metabank or another critical bank grew to a size such that it was no longer able to avail itself of certain regulatory exemptions for small banks we may be forced to find an alternative provider for these critical banking services it may not be possible to find a replacement bank on terms that are acceptable to us or at all any change in the issuing banks could disrupt the business or result in arrangements with new banks that are less favorable to us than those we have with our existing issuing banks either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position operating results and cash flows 

furthermore our business and consumer solutions segment depends in large part on establishing agreements with distributors marketers and brand partners primarily alternative financial services providers as well as grocery and convenience stores and other traditional retailers some of these companies may endeavor to internally develop their own programs or enter into exclusive relationships with our competitors to distribute or market their products the loss of or a substantial decrease in revenues from one or more of our top distributors marketers or brand partners could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position operating results and cash flows 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement our business may be adversely affected 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services we would have to find other financial institutions to provide those services if we were unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers which could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

increased merchant referral partner or iso attrition could cause our financial results to decline 

we experience attrition in merchant credit and debit card processing volume resulting from several factors including business closures transfers of merchant accounts to our competitors unsuccessful contract renewal negotiations and account closures that we initiate for various reasons such as heightened credit risks or contract breaches by merchants our referral partners are a significant source of new business if a referral partner or an iso switches to another transaction processor terminates our services internalizes payment processing functions that we perform merges with or is acquired by one of our competitors or shuts down or becomes insolvent we may no longer receive new merchant referrals from such referral partner and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the referral partner or iso we cannot predict the level of attrition in the future and it could increase higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our future growth depends in part on the continued expansion within markets in which we already operate the emergence of new markets and the continued availability of alliance relationships and strategic acquisition opportunities 

our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate the further expansion of these markets the emergence of other markets for payment technology and software solutions and our ability to penetrate these markets as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion we look for acquisition opportunities investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration technological capabilities product offerings and distribution capabilities we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition investment and alliance candidates in the future and if we do they may not provide us with the value and benefits we anticipate 

our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets if we fail to expand into new and existing markets for payment technology and software solutions we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 

our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the covid19 pandemic government actions in light of the pandemic trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments for example a number of countries including the us and countries in europe and the asiapacific region are considering or have adopted restrictions on foreign investments governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature and such restrictions could negatively affect our business and financial results 

further our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our expanded business which could pose substantial challenges for our management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated costs and complexity we may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of increasing the size of our business 

  

there may be a decline in the use of cards and other digital payments as a payment mechanism for consumers or other adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general 

while the covid19 pandemic has accelerated the digitization in payments if consumers do not continue to use credit debit or gpr prepaid debit cards or other digital payment methods of the type we process as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash checks credit cards and debit or gpr prepaid debit cards which is adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows consumer credit risk may make it more difficult or expensive for consumers to gain access to credit facilities such as credit cards regulatory changes may result in financial institutions seeking to charge their customers additional fees for use of credit or debit cards such fees may result in decreased use of credit or debit cards by cardholders in each case our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

consolidation among financial institutions or among retail customers including the merger of our customers with entities that are not our customers or the sale of portfolios by our customers to entities that are not our customers could materially affect our financial position results of operation and cash flows 

consolidation among financial institutions particularly in the area of credit card operations and consolidation in the retail industry is a risk that could negatively affect our existing agreements and future revenues with these customers in addition consolidation among financial institutions has led to an increasingly concentrated customer base which results in a changing mix toward larger customers continued consolidation among financial institutions could increase the bargaining power of our current and future customers and further increase our customer concentration consolidation among financial institutions and retail customers and the resulting loss of any significant number of customers by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we do not renew or renegotiate our agreements on favorable terms with our customers within the issuer solutions segment our business will suffer the timing of the conversions or deconversions of card portfolios may also affect our revenues and expenses 

a significant amount of our issuer solutions segment revenues is derived from longterm contracts with large financial institutions and other financial service providers the financial position of these customers and their willingness to pay for our services are affected by general market positions competitive pressures and operating margins within their industries when our longterm contracts near expiration the renewal or renegotiation of the contract presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers transition all or a portion of the services we provide inhouse or seek lower rates for our services additionally as we modernize the technology platform we use to deliver services some issuer solutions customers may not be agreeable to our modernization effort and may choose to end their contracts prematurely or not renew their contracts as a result the loss of our contracts with existing customers or renegotiation of contracts at reduced rates or reduced service levels could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the timing of the conversion of card portfolios of new payment processing customers to our processing systems and the deconversion of existing customers to other systems affects our revenues and expenses due to a variety of 

factors conversions and deconversions may not occur as scheduled and this may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

we incur chargeback losses when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse us for chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder if we are unable to collect such amounts from the merchants account or reserve account if applicable or if the merchant refuses or is unable due to closure bankruptcy or other reasons to reimburse us for a chargeback we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder the risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment we may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have policies to manage merchantrelated credit risk and often mitigate such risk by requiring collateral and monitoring transaction activity notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

fraud by merchants prepaid cardholders or others and losses from overdrawn cardholder accounts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have potential liability for fraudulent digital payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others and our prepaid card programs expose us to threats involving the misuse of cards collusion fraud and identity theft criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback losses or cause us to incur other liabilities it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future increases in chargebacks or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally the covid19 pandemic as well as macroeconomic conditions such as rising inflation and increased costs for labor and supplies has negatively affected or may continue to affect the financial viability and operations of certain merchants these consolidated financial statements reflect management’s estimates and assumptions related to allowances for transaction and credit losses utilizing the most currently available information the future magnitude duration and effects of the covid19 pandemic are difficult to predict at this time and the ultimate effect could result in additional charges related to the recoverability of assets actual losses could differ materially from those estimates 

increases in card network fees may result in the loss of customers andor a reduction in our earnings 

  

from timetotime the card networks including visa and mastercard increase the fees that they charge processors we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers but this strategy might result in the loss of customers to our competitors who may not pass along the increases thereby reducing our revenues and earnings if competitive practices prevent us from passing along the higher fees to our merchant customers in the future we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby reducing our earnings 

the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions if any could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 

the acquisition integration and conversion of businesses and the formation or operation of alliances or joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve a number of risks core risks are in the area of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on sometimes limited diligence and integration and conversion managing the complex process of integrating the acquired companys people services information security and technology and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition in addition international acquisitions and alliances often involve additional or increased risks including for example managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures complying with foreign regulatory requirements fluctuations in currency exchange rates enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries difficulty entering new foreign markets due to among other things customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets and general economic and political conditions 

if the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly the following factors among others could reduce our revenues and earnings increase our operating costs and result in us not achieving projected synergies 

• if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans duties and responsibilities and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business we could lose employees to our competitors in the region which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration 

• if the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services or the quality of those services we could lose customers to our competitors 

• the acquisition may otherwise cause disruption to the acquired company’s business and operations and relationships with financial institution sponsors customers merchants employees and other partners 

• the acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new markets for payments technology and software solutions and 

• the costs related to the integration of the acquired company’s business and operations into ours may be greater than anticipated 

legal regulatory compliance and tax risks 

our business is subject to government regulation and oversight any new implementation of or changes made to laws regulations or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable effect on our financial results and our cash flows 

as a payments technology company our business is affected by laws and complex regulations and examinations that affect us and our industry in the countries in which we operate regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years failure to comply with regulations or guidelines may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration the limitation suspension or termination of service and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties including fines or may cause customers or potential customers to be reluctant to do business with us any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

interchange fees are subject to intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide for instance the doddfrank act restricts the amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing institutions can charge merchants and allows merchants to set minimum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts for different payment methods these types of restrictions could negatively affect the number of debit transactions which would adversely affect our business the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws and the financial stability oversight council which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company such as us should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve on the ground that it is systemically important to the us financial system any such designation would result in increased regulatory burdens on our business which increases our risk profile and may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

because we directly or indirectly offer or provide financial services or products to consumers we are subject to prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices under the doddfrank act more generally all persons engaged in commerce including but not limited to us and our merchant and financial institution customers are subject to section 5 of the federal trade commission ftc act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap we also have businesses that are subject to credit reporting and debt collection laws and regulations in the us various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the ftc the cfpb and the states’ attorneys general have the authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in udap or violate other laws rules or regulations and to the extent we are in violation of these laws rules or regulations or processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to among others privacy antimoney laundering and debt collection regulations in addition we and our sponsor financial institutions are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by ofac which prohibit 

us persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons or entities similar requirements apply in other countries 

we are also subject to examination by the ffiec as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices or operations model which could result in potential liability for fines damages or a need to incur substantial costs to modify our operations compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming adding a layer of complexity to business practices and innovation as with other regulatory schemes our failure to comply could result in public or private enforcement action and accompanying litigation costs losses fines and penalties which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

with respect to our business and consumer solutions segment because each distributor offers prepaid cards reload services andor money remittance services as an agent of business and consumer solutions or another third party we do not believe that the distributors themselves are required to become licensed as money transmitters in order to engage in such activity however there is a risk that a federal or state regulator will take a contrary position and initiate enforcement or other proceedings against a distributor us our issuing banks or our other service providers if we are unsuccessful in making a persuasive argument that a distributor should not be subject to such licensing requirements and it is therefore deemed to be in violation of one or more of the state money transmitter statutes it could result in the imposition of fines the suspension of the distributor’s ability to offer some or all of our related services in the relevant jurisdiction civil liability and criminal liability each of which could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations furthermore if the federal government or one or more state governments impose additional legislative or regulatory requirements on our business and consumer solutions segment the issuing banks or the distributors or prohibit or limit the activities of our business and consumer solutions segment as currently conducted we may be required to modify or terminate some or all of our business and consumer solutions services offered in the relevant jurisdiction or certain of the issuing banks may terminate their relationship with us moreover as a number of our business and consumer solutions distributors are engaged in offering payday title andor installment loans current and future legislative and regulatory restrictions that negatively affect their ability to continue their operations could have a corresponding negative effect on our revenue and earnings from these relationships potentially resulting in a significant decline in revenue from the business and consumer solutions segment 

changes to legal rules and regulations or interpretation or enforcement thereof even if not directed at us may require significant efforts to change our systems and services and may require changes to how we price our services to customers adversely affecting our business even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness could damage our business or our reputation if varying or conflicting regulations come into existence across the jurisdictions in which we operate we may have difficulty aligning our operations to comply with all applicable laws 

new or revised tax regulations unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense 

changes in tax laws or their interpretations could result in changes to enacted tax rates and may require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the new or revised tax regulations and significant estimates in calculations as well as the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced future changes in enacted tax rates could negatively affect our results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows we have recognized estimated liabilities on the balance sheet for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial amount no more than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk 

we operate in a rapidly changing industry accordingly our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify monitor and manage our risks if our policies and procedures are not fully effective or if we are not always 

successful in identifying and mitigating all risks to which we are or may be exposed we may suffer uninsured liability harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

financial risks 

we are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows and we may not effectively hedge against these risks 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate and we may incur additional variablerate indebtedness in the future increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or dividends 

we are also subject to risks related to the changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar revenues and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in currency exchange rates volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results 

in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currencies into us dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates through the use of hedging arrangements to the extent that we hedge our interest rate or currency exchange rate exposures we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates or currency exchange rates were to change in our favor developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and currency exchange rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition a counterparty to the arrangement could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate these arrangements 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

we currently maintain investment credit ratings with nationally recognized statistical rating organizations unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively affect our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the capital markets could become restricted and our relationships with certain customers of our issuer solutions segment could also be affected future tightening in the credit markets and a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt additionally our credit facilities include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded 

the transition away from the london interbank offered rate libor benchmark interest rate and the adoption of alternative benchmark reference rates could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor furthermore we have entered into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the libor benchmark interest rate effective january 1 2022 the publication of libor on a representative basis ceased for the oneweek and twomonth usd libor settings and all sterling yen euros and swiss franc libor settings all other remaining usd libor settings will cease july 1 2023 

as described in note 1 — basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements to facilitate an orderly transition from libor to alternative benchmark rates the company established an initiative led by internal subject matter experts to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuance of libor in connection with the sunset of certain libor reference rates occurring at the end of 2021 we amended the unsecured revolving credit agreement in december 2021 to replace libor as administered by the ice benchmark administration with the sterling overnight index average reference rate and the euro interbank offered rate for 

any extension of credit denominated in sterling or euros respectively we continue to monitor developments related to the upcoming transition from usd libor to an alternative benchmark reference rate after june 30 2023 the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to usd libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 at this time the effects of the phase out of usd libor and the adoption of alternative benchmark rates have not been fully determined a failure to properly transition away from usd libor could adversely affect the company’s borrowing costs or expose the company to various financial operational and regulatory risks which could affect the company’s results of operations and cash flows 

failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including but not limited to preventing unauthorized access to our systems we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting furthermore this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we have completed or may complete 

in certain markets including without limitation china and spain our member sponsors perform payment processing operations and related support services pursuant to services agreements we expect that the member sponsors will continue to provide these services until such time as we may integrate these functions into our operations accordingly we rely on our member sponsors to provide financial data such as amounts billed to merchants to assist us with compiling our accounting records as such our internal control over financial reporting could be materially affected or is reasonably likely to be materially affected by the internal control and procedures of our member sponsors in these markets 

while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective internal control over financial reporting failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the markets perception of our business and on our stock price 

intellectual property risks 

we may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims 

in our rapidly developing legal framework we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or may develop software or technology that competes with ours our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property rights we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights trade secrets and knowhow or to determine their scope validity or enforceability which is expensive and could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove to be successful the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete 

we may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our services and technology infringe upon another party’s proprietary rights third parties may have or may eventually be issued patents that could be infringed by our services or technology any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our services or technology we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright trademark or license usage rights any such claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could limit our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and require us to design around a third party’s patent which may not be possible or to license alternative technology from another party which may be costly in addition such litigation is often time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our employees 

risks related to our capital structure 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect us and limit our business flexibility 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future our level of debt and the covenants to which we agreed could have negative consequences on us including among other things 1 requiring us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of the debt 2 limiting funds available for strategic 

initiatives and opportunities working capital and other general corporate needs and 3 limiting our ability to incur certain kinds or amounts of additional indebtedness which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our business our industry and economic conditions 

we may not be able to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs 

we may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs including developing new products and technologies or to fund future acquisitions or operating needs if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock we may also decide to issue securities including debt securities that have rights preferences and privileges senior to our common stock we may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all if financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our future needs this may prevent us from increasing our market share capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets the impairment of a portion of these assets could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a result of our acquisitions a significant portion of our total assets are intangible assets including goodwill goodwill and intangible assets net of amortization together accounted for approximately 80 of our total assets as of december 31 2021 we expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets including goodwill we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired under current accounting rules any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to record an impairment charge which would negatively affect our earnings an impairment of a portion of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to or we may decide not to pay dividends or repurchase shares at a level anticipated by our shareholders which could reduce shareholder returns 

  

the extent to which we pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other factors our results of operations financial condition capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant no assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to continue to pay any dividends or repurchase any shares in the foreseeable future 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

our business has been and will likely continue to be negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in the financial markets since early 2020 our financial results were affected by decreased spending and transaction volumes due to closures of or slowdowns of certain of our customer businesses throughout north america europe and asia pacific while we have seen and continue to see signs of economic recovery which has positively affected our financial results in 2021 compared to the prior year the rate of recovery on a global basis has been and may continue to be affected by additional developments related to covid19 

we have experienced and may continue to experience adverse effects due to a number of operational factors including but not limited to 

• thirdparty disruptions due to covid19 including potential outages and service effects at network providers call centers and other suppliers due to restrictions or closures imposed in relation to the pandemic 

• increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to covid19 as malicious third parties attempt to profit from the disruption given increased online banking ecommerce remote work and other online activity 

• challenges to the availability and reliability of our solutions and services due to changes to operations including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid19 cases occurring at our facilities affecting key employees or a significant portion of our workforce or third parties on which we depend or global supply chain disruptions 

• increased operational business continuity and cybersecurity risk resulting from a number of our employees working remotely as a result of the pandemic and 

• workforce effects such as difficulty recruiting retaining training motivating and developing employees due to evolving health and safety requirements and protocols changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models 

although the immediate effects of the covid19 pandemic have been assessed the longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and stock price will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict at this time such developments include but are not limited to the ultimate severity scope and duration of the pandemic and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness vaccine administration rates and efficacy resurgence of covid19 cases and emergence of new more contagious or vaccineresistant virus variants that may cause people to selfquarantine or governments to shut down nonessential businesses again and how soon and to what extent normal economic conditions operations and demand for our services can resume the continued covid19 pandemic has caused an economic slowdown in the us and other markets in which we operate it may also continue to affect financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely affect our access to financing or the terms of any such financing moreover the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic may persist for an indefinite period even after the pandemic has subsided 

in addition many of the other risk factors described herein are heightened by the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related economic conditions which in turn could materially adversely affect our business financial condition access to financing results of operations and liquidity 

risks related to general economic conditions 

we are subject to economic and geopolitical risk the business cycles and credit risk of our customers and the overall level of consumer business and government spending which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global payments technology industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer business and government spending we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence spending and discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate supply chain disruptions inflationary pressure or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions made using digital payments a reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenues and profits if our merchants make fewer sales to consumers using digital payments or consumers using digital payments spend less per transaction we will have fewer transactions to process or lower transaction amounts each of which would contribute to lower revenues additionally credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

a downturn in the economy could force merchants financial institutions or other customers to close or petition for bankruptcy protection resulting in lower revenue and earnings for us and greater exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines we also have a certain amount of fixed costs including rent debt service and salaries which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy changes in economic conditions could also adversely affect our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

credit losses arise from the fact that in most markets we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period this results in the buildup of a substantial receivable from our customers if a merchant were to go out of business during the billing period we may be unable to collect such fees which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our business growth financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic conditions inflation changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict or action by the united states or foreign governments that may restrict our ability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities a possible slowdown in global trade caused by increasing tariffs or other restrictions could decrease consumer or corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending in countries inside or outside the united states 

which could adversely affect our operations climaterelated events including extreme weather events and natural disasters and their effect on critical infrastructure in the us or internationally could have similar adverse effects on our operations customers or thirdparty suppliers 

furthermore shareholders customers and other stakeholders have begun to consider how corporations are addressing esg issues government regulators investors customers and the general public are increasingly focused on esg practices and disclosures and views about esg are diverse and rapidly changing these shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of the companys common stock if investors determine that the company has not made sufficient progress on esg matters we could also face potential negative esgrelated publicity in traditional media or social media if shareholders or other stakeholders determine that we have not adequately considered or addressed esg matters we have been the recipient of proposals from shareholders to promote their governance positions such proposals may not be in the longterm interests of the company or our stockholders and may divert management’s attention away from operational matters or create the impression that our practices are inadequate shareholders are increasingly submitting proposals related to a variety of esg issues to public companies and we may receive other such proposals in the future 

the uks withdrawal from the european union could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in january 2020 the uk formally withdrew from the eu in an action commonly known as brexit it remains possible that the level of economic activity in this region will be adversely affected by brexit and that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities including those relating to tax trade data transfers security and employees such changes could be costly and potentially disruptive to our operations and business relationships in these markets economic uncertainty related to brexit including volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates could adversely affect our business while we have not experienced significant adverse effects on our uk business and its financial condition results of operations and cash flows to date no assurance can be given regarding the potential future effects of brexit and our uk business and our financial conditions results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

general risk factors 

if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow our business could be adversely affected 

all of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological social economic and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital to successfully compete and grow we must recruit develop and retain personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of intellectual capital needs in addition we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital however the market for qualified personnel is extremely competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors we cannot be assured that key personnel including executive officers will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows failure to retain develop or attract key personnel to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture including increasing the proportion of our workforce in the us that is composed of women and minorities or to design and successfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and future success 

the costs and effects of pending and future litigation investigations or similar matters or adverse facts and developments related thereto could materially affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are from timetotime involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and any claims asserted against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome may harm our reputation litigation could be costly timeconsuming and divert attention of management from daily operational needs furthermore there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage such judgments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we have grown organically as well as through acquisitions we also continue to invest in new technology solutions infrastructure to support our growing business and the continued consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms these investments include new product development and innovation to further enhance and differentiate our suite of technology and cloudbased solutions available to customers along with migration of certain underlying technology platforms to cloud environments to enhance performance and drive cost efficiencies we also continue to execute on merger and integration activities primarily related to the merger such as combining business operations streamlining technology infrastructure eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures and realizing scale efficiencies 

highlights related to our financial condition at december 31 2021 and results of operations for the year then ended include the following 

• consolidated revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 increased to 85238 million compared to 74236 million for the prior year the increase in consolidated revenues is primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes from continued economic recovery as covid19 restrictions eased and acceleration in the use of digital payment solutions 

• consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 increased to 13589 million compared to 8940 million for the prior year operating margin for the year ended december 31 2021 increased to 159 compared to 120 for the prior year the increase in consolidated operating income and operating margin for the year ended december 31 2021 is primarily due to the increase in revenues and favorable effects of mergerrelated cost synergies 

• we expanded our business through the execution of several strategic acquisitions 

◦ on june 10 2021 we acquired zego a real estate technology company that provides a comprehensive resident experience management software and digital commerce solutions to property managers primarily in the united states for cash consideration of approximately 933 million this acquisition aligns with our technologyenabled software driven strategy and expands our business into a new vertical market

emerging trends 

the payments technology industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result certain large payment technology companies including us have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures we expect to continue to expand into new markets internationally and increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing additional acquisitions and joint ventures 

the industry continues to grow as a result of wider merchant acceptance and increased use of credit and debit cards advances in payment processing technology and migration to ecommerce omnichannel and contactless payment solutions the proliferation of credit and debit cards as well as other digital payment solutions has made the acceptance of digital payments a virtual necessity for many businesses regardless of size in order to remain competitive further the expanding digitization of the economy and availability and access to financial services increases the demand for cards and digital payment solutions which in turn drives growth in acceptance and transaction volumes 

the use of digital payment solutions the need for development of technologies and digitalbased solutions and expansion of ecommerce omnichannel and contactless payment solutions has accelerated in part as a result of the covid19 pandemic we believe that the number of digital payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies as a result we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies including technology modernization innovation and integration through strategic partnerships 

we also believe new markets will continue to develop and expand in areas that have been previously dominated by paperbased transactions we expect industries such as education government and healthcare as well as recurring payments and b2b payments to continue to see transactions migrate to digitalbased solutions we anticipate that the continued development of new services and technologies the emergence of new vertical markets and continued expansion of technologyenabled ecommerce and omnichannel solutions including expanded scale and market reach through new innovative cloudbased capabilities and strategic partnerships will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future

covid19 update 

since early 2020 the global economy has been affected by the covid19 pandemic the pandemic has caused and may continue to cause significant disruptions to businesses and markets worldwide through the continued spread of the virus including through a resurgence of covid19 cases or emergence of new more contagious or vaccineresistant virus variants in certain jurisdictions beginning in midmarch 2020 our financial results were affected by decreased spending and transaction volumes as governments implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus including lockdowns physical distancing travel restrictions limitations on public gatherings work from home and restrictions on nonessential businesses we saw improvement in our financial results during the latter half of 2020 and in 2021 driven by an increase in spending and transaction volumes as a result of an ease in restrictions and distribution of economic stimulus provided by certain governments and continued vaccine distribution while we continue to see signs of economic recovery which has positively affected our financial results in 2021 compared to the prior year the rate of recovery on a global basis has been and may continue to be affected by additional developments related to covid19 

at the onset of the pandemic we took early actions to preserve our available capital and provide financial flexibility in response to the effects of covid19 on our business including the temporary reduction of certain operating expenses employee compensation costs other discretionary spending and planned capital expenditures adding to the strength of our financial profile certain operating expenses capital expenditures and other investments in the business have recently returned to more normalized levels we expect to continue to make significant capital investments in the business while also continuing to manage other discretionary spending we continue to closely monitor the covid19 pandemic however the implications on future global economic conditions and related effects on our business and financial condition are difficult to predict due to continuing uncertainties around the ultimate severity scope and duration of the pandemic vaccine administration rates and efficacy resurgence of covid19 cases and emergence of new more contagious or vaccineresistant virus variants and the direction or extent of current or future restrictive actions that may be imposed by governments or public health authorities

the estimates we use to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets the estimated fair values of customerrelated and contractbased intangible assets are generally determined using the income approach which is based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows the discount rates used represented a risk adjusted market participant weightedaverage cost of capital derived using customary market metrics these measures of fair value also require considerable judgments about future events including forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted customer attrition rates contract renewal estimates and technology changes acquired technologies are generally valued using the replacement cost method which requires us to estimate the costs to construct an asset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence trademarks and trade names are generally valued using the relieffromroyalty approach this method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenues for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weightedaverage cost of capital this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the period over which to recognize the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible assets as an expense we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill — we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 each year we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative assessment for impairment is necessary the option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit 

factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of our reporting units events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entityspecific events if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount a quantitative test would be required 

the quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit when applying the quantitative assessment we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions  

our reporting units consist of the following north america payment solutions integrated solutions vertical market software solutions europe merchant solutions spain merchant solutions asiapacific merchant solutions issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions as of october 1 2021 we performed a quantitative assessment of impairment for our vertical market software solutions issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units we determined on the basis of the quantitative assessment of our vertical market software solutions issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions reporting units that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying amount additionally we determined on the basis of the qualitative factors that the fair value of other reporting units was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts we believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount except for issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions which have smaller excess compared to the other reporting units since they were recently acquired in the merger 

our current year assessments performed as of october 1 2021 included consideration of the expected effects of the covid19 pandemic on revenues and our cost mitigation efforts as well as longer term performance expectations we continue to closely monitor developments related to covid19 the future magnitude duration and effects of the pandemic are difficult to predict at this time and it is reasonably possible that future developments could have a negative effect on the estimates and assumptions utilized in our goodwill impairment assessments and could result in material impairment charges in future periods 

there were no changes in reporting units or significant changes in the methodology used to assess goodwill impairment during the year ended december 31 2021 we regularly monitor any changes in the business and evaluate whether such changes affect the determination of our reporting units 

intangible and longlived assets — intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives the useful lives for customerrelated intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows which include estimates for the revenues expenses and customer attrition associated with the assets the useful lives of contractbased intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements the useful lives of acquired technologies are based on an estimate of the period over which we expect to receive economic benefit the useful lives of amortizable trademarks and trade names are based on an estimate of the period over which we will earn revenues for the related brands including contemplation of any future plans to phase out the trademarks and trade names in the applicable markets 

we use the straightline method of amortization for our amortizable acquired technologies trademarks and trade names and certain contractbased intangibles amortization for most of our customerrelated intangible assets and certain contractbased intangibles is determined using an accelerated method under this accelerated method the first step in determining the amortization expense for any period is that we divide the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquisitiondate fair value of the asset divided by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset we then multiply that ratio by the initial carrying amount of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates we adjust the amortization schedule prospectively we believe that our accelerated method reflects the expected pattern of the benefit to be derived we did not make any significant adjustments to the amortization schedules of our intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2021 

we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment lease rightofuse assets and finitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable when factors indicate that these longlived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such longlived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition the evaluation is performed at the asset group level which is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the carrying amount of the asset group is determined not to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recorded measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may warrant revision 

as a result of actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 to reduce our facilities footprint in certain markets around the world given the success of remote work and flexible arrangements implemented during the covid19 pandemic we recognized charges of 513 million primarily related to certain lease rightofuse assets leasehold improvements furniture and fixtures and equipment to reduce the carrying amount of each asset group to estimated fair value we continue to evaluate our physical footprint and additional charges may be incurred as these facilities exit activities continue in 2022 

capitalization of internaluse software 

we develop software that is used in providing services to customers capitalization of internaluse software primarily associated with operating platforms occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage management authorizes the project management commits to funding the project it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives the evaluation of alternatives the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are recognized as expense as incurred currently unforeseen circumstances in software development such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs the carrying amount of internaluse software including workinprogress at december 31 2021 was 7420 million costs capitalized during the year ended december 31 2021 totaled 2559 million internaluse software is amortized over its estimated useful life which is typically 5 to 10 years in a manner that best reflects the pattern of economic use of the assets there were no significant changes in the accounting methodology used for capitalization of internaluse software during the year ended december 31 2021 

during the year ended december 31 2019 we preliminarily determined our target technology architecture for the combined company as a result we wroteoff capitalized software assets of 311 million related to legacy global payments technology that will no longer be utilized 

revenue recognition 

in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 we apply judgment in the determination of performance obligations in particular related to large customer contracts within the issuer solutions segment performance obligations in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us and are distinct in the context of the contract whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract to the extent a contract includes multiple promised services we must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract if these criteria are not met the promised services are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation in addition a single performance obligation may comprise a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer 

income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using managements judgments estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable however we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized when facts and circumstances change including an effective settlement of an issue or statute of limitations expiration the effect is recognized in the period of change the unrecognized tax benefits that exist at december 31 2021 would affect our provision for income taxes in the future if recognized 

judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized to the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made 

see note 10 — income tax in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and deferred tax valuation allowances during the year ended december 31 2021

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies consequently a portion of our revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not historically hedged our translation risk on foreign currency exposure but we may do so in the future for the year ended december 31 2021 currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our consolidated revenues by approximately 907 million and increased our operating income by approximately 385 million compared to the prior year calculated by converting revenues and operating income respectively for the current year excluding revenues and operating income from current year acquisitions in local currencies using exchange rates for the prior year 

generally the functional currency of our various subsidiaries is their local currency we are exposed to currency fluctuations on transactions that are not denominated in the functional currency gains and losses on such transactions are included in determining net income for the period we seek to mitigate our foreign currency risk through timely settlement of transactions and cash flow matching when possible for the year ended december 31 2021 our transaction gains and losses were insignificant 

additionally we are affected by currency fluctuations in our funds settlement process on merchant payment chargeback and card network settlement transactions that are not denominated in the currency of the underlying credit or debit card transaction gains and losses on these transactions are included in revenues for the period 

we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on our investments in foreign operations relative to our net investment in foreign operations the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the periodend rate of exchange the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and is included in shareholders equity transaction gains and losses on intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature are also recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on certain of our longterm borrowings and cash investments we invest our excess cash in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 

we have a senior unsecured 20 billion term loan facility and a senior unsecured 30 billion revolving credit facility as well as various lines of credit that we use to fund settlement in certain of our markets each of which bears interest at rates that are based on market rates and fluctuate accordingly as of december 31 2021 the amount outstanding under these variablerate debt arrangements and settlement lines of credit was 25 billion 

the interest earned on our invested cash and the interest paid on a portion of our debt are based on variable interest rates therefore the exposure of our net income to a change in interest rates is partially mitigated as an increase in rates would increase both interest income and interest expense and a reduction in rates would decrease both interest income and interest expense under our current policies we may selectively use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements to manage all or a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes we have entered into interest rate swaps that reduce a portion of our exposure to market interest rate risk on certain of our variablerate debt as discussed in note 8—longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

based on balances outstanding under variablerate debt agreements and invested cash balances at december 31 2021 a hypothetical increase of 50 basis points in applicable interest rates as of december 31 2021 would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 56 million and increase our annual interest income by approximately 15 million 

a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on the usd london interbank offered rate libor furthermore we have entered into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the usd libor benchmark interest rate to facilitate an orderly transition from usd libor to alternative benchmark rates the company established an initiative led by internal subject matter experts to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuance of usd libor we continue to monitor developments related to the anticipated transition from usd libor to an alternative benchmark reference rate and evaluate the related risks in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate which primarily include loan interest payments and amounts received and paid on interest rate swaps additionally we maintain contact with our lenders and other stakeholders to evaluate the potential effects of these changes on any future financing activities while we currently expect certain usd libor benchmark rates to be available until june 30 2023 it is possible that usd libor will become unavailable prior to that time this could result for example if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the libor administrator in that case the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated

 item 9a  controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2021 management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2021 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the internal control — integrated framework 2013  

on june 10 2021 we completed the acquisition of zego as permitted by the sec rules and regulations managements assessment did not include the internal control of the acquired operations of zego which are included in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2021 and for the period from the acquisition date through december 31 2021 in accordance with our integration efforts we plan to incorporate the acquired operations of zego into our internal control over financial reporting program within the time period provided by applicable sec rules and regulations the assets excluding goodwill of the acquired operations of zego constituted approximately 1 of our total consolidated assets as of december 31 2021 operating results of the acquired operations of zego comprised less than 1 of our total consolidated revenues and less than 1 of our consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31 2021 

based on the results of its evaluation which excluded assessments of the internal control of the acquired operations of zego management believes that as of december 31 2021 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk

credit and debit card transaction processing 

credit and debit card transaction processing includes the processing of the worlds major international card brands including american express discover card discover jcb mastercard unionpay international upi and visa as well as certain domestic debit networks such as interac in canada credit and debit networks establish uniform regulations that govern much of the payment card industry during a typical payment transaction the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other but instead rely on payments technology companies such as global payments to facilitate transaction processing services including authorization electronic draft capture file transfers to facilitate funds settlement and certain exceptionbased back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 

we process funds settlement under two models a sponsorship model and a direct membership model under the sponsorship model member clearing financial institutions members sponsor us and require our adherence to the standards of the networks in these markets we have sponsorship or depository and clearing agreements with financial institution sponsors these agreements allow us to route transactions under the members control and identification numbers to clear card transactions through mastercard and visa in this model the standards of the card networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds and instead require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant has been funded 

under the direct membership model we are direct members in various payment networks allowing us to process and fund transactions without thirdparty sponsorship under this model we route and clear transactions directly through the card brand’s network and are not restricted from performing funds settlement otherwise we process these transactions similarly to how we process transactions in the sponsorship model we are required to adhere to the standards of the various networks in which we are direct members we maintain relationships with financial institutions which may also serve as our member sponsors for other card brands or in other markets to assist with funds settlement 

how a card transaction works 

a typical payment transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location where the card information is captured by a pointofsale pos terminal card reader or mobile device card reader which may be sold or leased to the merchant and serviced by us alternatively card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device or ecommerce portal by one of a number of services that we offer directly or through a valueadded reseller the card reader electronically records sales draft information such as the card identification number transaction date and transaction amount 

after the card and transaction information is captured the pos device automatically connects to our network through the internet or other communication channel in order to receive authorization of the transaction for a credit card transaction authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction amount will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits in a debit card transaction we obtain authorization for the transaction from the card issuer through the payment network verifying that the cardholder has access to sufficient funds for the transaction amount 

as an illustration shown below in the sponsorship model on a 10000 card transaction the card issuer may fund the member our sponsor indirectly through the card network 9850 after retaining approximately 150 referred to as an interchange fee the card issuer seeks reimbursement of 10000 from the cardholder in the cardholders monthly credit card statement the member would in turn pay the merchant 10000 the net settlement after this transaction would require us to advance the member 150 after the end of the month we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction amount or merchant discount to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our fee from the transaction if our discount rate for the merchant in the above example was 200 we would bill the merchant 200 after the end of the month for the transaction reimburse ourselves for 150 in interchange fees and retain 050 as our fees for the transaction under some arrangements we remit the net amount of 9800 to the merchant rather than funding the full 10000 and subsequently billing the merchant at the end of the month discount rates vary based on negotiations with merchants and the economic characteristics of transactions interchange rates also vary based on the economic characteristics of individual transactions accordingly our fee per transaction varies across our merchant base and is subject to change based on changes in discount rates and interchange rates our profit on the transaction reflects the fee received less payment network fees and operating expenses including systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or iso payment network fees are charged by the card brands in part based on the value of transactions processed through their networks

in addition the doddfrank act limits the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions because it allows merchants to i set minimum dollar amounts not to exceed 10 for the acceptance of a credit card and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and ii provide discounts or incentives to encourage consumers to pay with cash checks debit cards or credit cards 

the rules also contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions that require a card issuer to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements and restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements the prohibition on network exclusivity has not significantly affected our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our customers nor do we expect it to in the future 

the doddfrank act also created the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws and the financial stability oversight council which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company such as us should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve on the ground that it is systemically important to the us financial system accordingly we may be subject to additional systemic riskrelated oversight

risks related to our business model and operations including the use of technology 

our ability to protect our systems and data from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks could affect our reputation among our customers and cardholders adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial institution sponsorship and expose us to penalties fines liabilities and legal claims 

in order to provide our services we process and store sensitive business and personal information which may include credit and debit card numbers bank account numbers social security numbers driver’s license numbers names and addresses and other types of personal information or sensitive business information some of this information is also processed and stored by financial institutions merchants and other entities as well as thirdparty service providers to whom we outsource certain functions and other agents which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties we may have responsibility to the card networks financial institutions and in some instances our merchants isos andor individuals for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties as applicable to protect this information 

we are a regular target of malicious thirdparty attempts to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities andor penetrate or bypass our security measures in order to gain unauthorized access to our networks and systems or those of our associated third parties such access could lead to the compromise of sensitive business personal or confidential information as a result we follow a defenseindepth model for cybersecurity meaning we proactively seek to employ multiple methods at different layers to defend our systems against intrusion and attack and to protect the data we collect however we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats 

our computer systems andor our associated third parties’ computer systems could be subject to penetration and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect and continually evolve and become more sophisticated threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties including statesponsored organizations with significant financial and technological resources computer viruses and other malware can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service ransomware or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities our defensive measures may not prevent downtime unauthorized access or use of sensitive data while we maintain first and thirdparty insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses companies we acquire may require postclosing implementation of additional cyber defense methods to align with our standards and as a result there may be a period of increased risk between the closing of an acquisition and the completion of such implementation further certain of our thirdparty relationships are subject to our vendor management program and governed by written contracts however we do not control the actions of our associated third parties and any problems experienced by these third parties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in the services provided by such parties or cyberattacks and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to service our customers or otherwise conduct our business 

in addition we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to use security and privacy that we impose on our associated third parties who have access to this data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the misuse of this data any misuse or compromise of personal information or failure to adequately enforce these contractual requirements could result in liability protracted and costly litigation and with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers lost revenue and reputational harm 

any type of security breach attack or misuse of data described above or otherwise whether experienced by us or an associated third party could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services or from making electronic payments generally increase our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the incident expose us to unanticipated or uninsured liability disrupt our operations including potential service interruptions distract our management increase our risk of litigation or regulatory scrutiny result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state federal and foreign laws or by the card networks and adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership 

and financial institution sponsorship our removal from networks lists of payment card industry data security standard compliant service providers could mean that existing customers sales partners or other third parties may cease using or referring our services also prospective merchant customers financial institutions sales partners or other third parties may choose to terminate negotiations with us or delay or choose not to consider us for their processing needs in addition the card networks could refuse to allow us to process through their networks 

we may experience software defects undetected errors and development delays which could damage customer relations decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability 

our services are based on software and computing systems that often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software services and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation and exposure to liability claims 

in addition we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our systems or our thirdparty providers systems may fail which could interrupt our service cause us to lose business increase our costs and expose us to liability 

we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems software data centers and telecommunications networks as well as the systems and services of third parties a system outage or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows not only could we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss but we may also be liable to third parties many of our contractual agreements with financial institutions and certain other customers require the payment of penalties if we do not meet certain operating standards our systems and operations or those of our thirdparty providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from among other things fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure terrorist acts war unauthorized entry human error and computer viruses or other defects defects in our systems or those of third parties errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions telecommunications failures or other difficulties including those related to system relocation could result in loss of revenues loss of customers loss of merchant and cardholder data harm to our business or reputation exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities negative publicity additional operating and development costs fines and other sanctions imposed by card networks andor diversion of technical and other resources 

the payments technology industry is highly competitive and some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do which may give them an advantage with respect to the pricing of services offered to customers and the ability to develop new technologies 

we operate in the payments technology industry which is highly competitive in this industry our primary competitors include other independent payment processors credit card processing firms as well as financial institutions isos prepaid programs managers and potentially card networks we compete with many larger companies that have greater financial and operational resources than we have our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a direct member for participation in the card networks as we do in certain jurisdictions and may be able to settle transactions more quickly for merchants than we can these financial institutions may also provide payment processing services to merchants at a loss in order to generate banking fees from the merchants it is also possible that larger financial institutions including some who are customers of ours could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide these attributes may provide them with a competitive advantage in the market 

additionally the market for prepaid cards demand deposit accounts and alternative financial services is similarly highly competitive and competition is increasing as more companies endeavor to address the needs of underbanked consumers we anticipate increased competition from alternative financial services providers who are often well positioned to service the underbanked and who may wish to develop their own prepaid card or demand deposit account programs we also face strong price competition to stay competitive we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our distributors and reduce the prices of our services which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and cash flows 

furthermore we are facing increasing competition from nontraditional competitors including new entrant technology companies who offer certain innovations in payment methods some of these competitors utilize proprietary software and service solutions some of these nontraditional competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers in addition some nontraditional competitors such as private companies or startup companies may be less risk averse than we are and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to market demands these competitors may compete in ways that minimize or remove the role of traditional card networks acquirers issuers and processors in the electronic payments process if these nontraditional competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings we must continually and quickly update our services a process that could result in higher costs and the loss of revenues earnings and customers if the new services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 

the payments technology industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in a number of projects including the development of new platforms mobile payment applications ecommerce services and other new offerings emerging in the payments technology industry these projects carry the risks associated with any development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance problems in the payments technology markets these risks are even more acute any delay in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate our services could render our services less desirable to customers or possibly even obsolete furthermore as the market for alternative payment processing services evolves it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new services targeted at this market 

in addition certain of the services we deliver to the payments technology markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions all at very high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies as a result of these factors our development efforts could result in higher costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenues and earnings if promised new services are not delivered timely to our customers or do not perform as anticipated 

our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa and mastercard are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registrations financial institution sponsorship and in some cases continued membership in certain card networks 

  

in order to provide our visa and mastercard transaction processing services we must be either a direct member or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of visa and mastercard respectively registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of each organization in certain jurisdictions if our sponsor financial institution in any market should stop providing sponsorship for us we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers and potential customers in that market which would negatively affect our revenues earnings and cash flows furthermore some agreements with our financial institution sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants our sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in connection with direct membership the rules and regulations of various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would limit our use of capital for other purposes 

the termination of our registration or any changes in the visa or mastercard rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing visa and mastercard payment processing services which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale the rules of the card networks may be influenced by card issuers and some of those issuers also provide acquiring services and are our competitors or our customers in both the merchant solutions and issuer solutions segments if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks the card networks could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations or membership the termination of our registrations or our membership or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial 

condition results of operations and cash flows if a merchant or an iso customer fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks we or the merchant or iso could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks if we cannot collect or pursue collection of such amounts from the applicable merchant or iso we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties resulting in lower earnings for us 

our business and consumer solutions segment relies on certain relationships with issuing banks distributors marketers and brand partners the loss of such relationships or if we are unable to maintain such relationships on terms that are favorable to us may materially adversely affect our business financial position operating results and cash flows 

our business and consumer solutions segment relies on arrangements that we have with issuing banks to provide us with critical products and services including the fdicinsured depository accounts tied to the cards and accounts we manage access to the atm networks membership in the card associations and network organizations and other banking services the majority of our active business and consumer solutions cards and accounts are issued or opened through meta payment systems metabank if any material adverse event were to affect metabanks or another of our critical issuing banks or we were to lose metabank or another critical bank or metabank or another critical bank grew to a size such that it was no longer able to avail itself of certain regulatory exemptions for small banks we may be forced to find an alternative provider for these critical banking services it may not be possible to find a replacement bank on terms that are acceptable to us or at all any change in the issuing banks could disrupt the business or result in arrangements with new banks that are less favorable to us than those we have with our existing issuing banks either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position operating results and cash flows 

furthermore our business and consumer solutions segment depends in large part on establishing agreements with distributors marketers and brand partners primarily alternative financial services providers as well as grocery and convenience stores and other traditional retailers some of these companies may endeavor to internally develop their own programs or enter into exclusive relationships with our competitors to distribute or market their products the loss of or a substantial decrease in revenues from one or more of our top distributors marketers or brand partners could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position operating results and cash flows 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement our business may be adversely affected 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services we would have to find other financial institutions to provide those services if we were unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers which could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

increased merchant referral partner or iso attrition could cause our financial results to decline 

we experience attrition in merchant credit and debit card processing volume resulting from several factors including business closures transfers of merchants accounts to our competitors unsuccessful contract renewal negotiations and account closures that we initiate for various reasons such as heightened credit risks or contract breaches by merchants our referral partners are a significant source of new business if a referral partner or an iso switches to another transaction processor terminates our services internalizes payment processing functions that we perform merges with or is acquired by one of our competitors or shuts down or becomes insolvent we may no longer receive new merchant referrals from such referral partner and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the referral partner or iso we cannot predict the level of attrition in the future and it could increase higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our future growth depends in part on the continued expansion within markets in which we already operate the emergence of new markets and the continued availability of alliance relationships and strategic acquisition opportunities 

our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate the further expansion of these markets the emergence of other markets for payment technology and software solutions and our ability to penetrate these markets as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion we look for acquisition opportunities investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration technological capabilities product offerings and distribution capabilities we may not be able to successfully identify suitable 

acquisition investment and alliance candidates in the future and if we do they may not provide us with the value and benefits we anticipate 

our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets if we fail to expand into new and existing markets for payment technology and software solutions we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 

our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by the effects of the covid19 pandemic government actions in light of the pandemic trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments for example a number of countries including the us and countries in europe and the asiapacific region are considering or have adopted restrictions on foreign investments governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature and such restrictions could negatively affect our business and financial results 

further our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our expanded business which could pose substantial challenges for our management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated costs and complexity we may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of increasing the size of our business 

  

there may be a decline in the use of cards and other electronic payments as a payment mechanism for consumers or other adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general 

if consumers do not continue to use credit debit or gpr prepaid debit cards or other electronic payment methods of the type we process as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash checks credit cards and debit or gpr prepaid debit cards which is adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows consumer credit risk may make it more difficult or expensive for consumers to gain access to credit facilities such as credit cards regulatory changes may result in financial institutions seeking to charge their customers additional fees for use of credit or debit cards such fees may result in decreased use of credit or debit cards by cardholders in each case our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

consolidation among financial institutions or among retail customers including the merger of our customers with entities that are not our customers or the sale of portfolios by our customers to entities that are not our customers could materially affect our financial position results of operation and cash flows 

consolidation among financial institutions particularly in the area of credit card operations and consolidation in the retail industry is a risk that could negatively affect our existing agreements and future revenues with these customers in addition consolidation among financial institutions has led to an increasingly concentrated customer base which results in a changing mix toward larger customers continued consolidation among financial institutions could increase the bargaining power of our current and future customers and further increase our customer concentration consolidation among financial institutions and retail customers and the resulting loss of any significant number of customers by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

if we do not renew or renegotiate our agreements on favorable terms with our customers within the issuer solutions segment our business will suffer the timing of the conversions or deconversions of card portfolio may also affect our revenues and expenses 

a significant amount of our issuer solutions segment revenues is derived from longterm contracts with large financial institutions and other financial service providers the financial position of these customers and their willingness to pay for our services are affected by general market positions competitive pressures and operating margins within their industries when our longterm contracts expire the time of renewal or renegotiation presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers transition all or a portion of the services we provide inhouse or seek lower rates for our services additionally as we modernize the technology platform we use to deliver services some issuer solutions customers may not be agreeable to our modernization effort and may choose to end their contracts prematurely or not renew their contracts as a result the loss of our contracts with existing customers or renegotiation of contracts at reduced rates or reduced service levels could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the timing of the conversion of card portfolios of new payment processing customers to our processing systems and the deconversion of existing customers to other systems affects our revenues and expenses due to a variety of factors conversions and deconversions may not occur as scheduled and this may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

we incur chargeback losses when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse us for chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder if we are unable to collect such amounts from the merchants account or reserve account if applicable or if the merchant refuses or is unable due to closure bankruptcy or other reasons to reimburse us for a chargeback we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder the risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment we may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have policies to manage merchantrelated credit risk and often mitigate such risk by requiring collateral and monitoring transaction activity notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

fraud by merchants prepaid cardholders or others and losses from overdrawn cardholder accounts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others and our prepaid card programs expose us to threats involving the misuse of cards collusion fraud and identity theft criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback losses or cause us to incur other liabilities it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future increases in chargebacks or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

additionally covid19 has negatively affected the financial viability and operations of certain merchants these consolidated financial statements reflect management’s estimates and assumptions related to allowances for transaction and credit losses utilizing the most currently available information the future magnitude duration and effects of the covid19 pandemic are difficult to predict at this time and the ultimate effect could result in additional charges related to the recoverability of assets actual losses could differ materially from those estimates 

increases in card network fees may result in the loss of customers andor a reduction in our earnings 

  

from timetotime the card networks including visa and mastercard increase the fees that they charge processors we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers but this strategy might result in the loss of customers to our competitors who may not pass along the increases thereby reducing our revenues and earnings if competitive practices prevent us from passing along the higher fees to our merchant customers in the future we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby reducing our earnings 

the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions if any could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 

the acquisition integration and conversion of businesses and the formation or operation of alliances such as the merger or joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve a number of risks core risks are in the area of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on sometimes limited diligence and integration and conversion managing the complex process of integrating the acquired companys people services information security and technology and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition in addition international acquisitions and alliances often involve additional or increased risks including for example managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures complying with foreign regulatory requirements fluctuations in currency exchange rates enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries difficulty entering new foreign markets due to 

among other things customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets and general economic and political conditions 

if the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly the following factors among others could reduce our revenues and earnings increase our operating costs and result in us not achieving projected synergies 

• if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans duties and responsibilities and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business we could lose employees to our competitors in the region which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration 

• if the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services or the quality of those services we could lose customers to our competitors 

• the acquisition may otherwise cause disruption to the acquired company’s business and operations and relationships with financial institution sponsors customers merchants employees and other partners 

• the acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new markets for payments technology and software solutions and 

• the costs related to the integration of the acquired company’s business and operations into ours may be greater than anticipated 

legal regulatory compliance and tax risks 

our business is subject to government regulation and oversight any new implementation of or changes made to laws regulations or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable effect on our financial results and our cash flows 

our business is affected by laws and regulations and examinations that affect us and our industry in the countries in which we operate regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years failure to comply with regulations or guidelines may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration the limitation suspension or termination of service and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties including fines or may cause customers or potential customers to be reluctant to do business with us any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 

interchange fees are subject to intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide for instance the doddfrank act restricts the amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing institutions can charge merchants and allows merchants to set minimum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts for different payment methods these types of restrictions could negatively affect the number of debit transactions which would adversely affect our business the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws and the financial stability oversight council which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company such as us should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve on the ground that it is systemically important to the us financial system any such designation would result in increased regulatory burdens on our business which increases our risk profile and may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

all persons offering or providing financial services or products to consumers directly or indirectly can be subject to prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices under the doddfrank act more generally all persons engaged in commerce including but not limited to us and our merchant and financial institution customers are also subject to section 5 of the federal trade commission ftc act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap in addition there are other laws rules and or regulations including the telemarketing sales act that may directly affect us or the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us to investigations fees fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the ftc the cfpb and the states’ attorneys general have the authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in udap or violate other laws rules or regulations and to the extent we are in violation of these laws rules or 

regulations or processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities 

in many countries we are legally or contractually required to comply with the antimoney laundering laws and regulations such as in the united states the bank secrecy act and similar laws of other countries which require that customer identifying information be obtained and verified in some countries we are directly subject to these requirements in other countries we have contractually agreed to assist our financial institution customers with their obligation to comply with antimoney laundering requirements that apply to them in addition we and our sponsor financial institutions are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by ofac which prohibit us persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons or entities similar requirements apply in other countries our failure to comply with any of these contractual requirements or laws could adversely affect our business financial credit results of operations and cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of foreign and domestic laws and their implementing regulations which establish requirements for the collection processing storage use and disclosure of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information for example we are subject to applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate the payment services directive in europe the eu general data protection regulation the code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry in canada issued by canadas department of finance the california consumer protection act the housing assistance tax act of 2008 in the united states hipaa and other health privacy regulations and a myriad of us federal and state consumer protection laws and state escheat regulations in addition the uk payment systems regulator has increased its oversight of the card acquiring industry we are also subject to examination by the ffiec as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices or operations model which could result in potential liability for fines damages or a need to incur substantial costs to modify our operations compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming adding a layer of complexity to business practices and innovation as with other regulatory schemes our failure to comply could result in public or private enforcement action and accompanying litigation costs losses fines and penalties 

portions of our business may be subject to the fdcpa the fcra and similar state laws these debt collection laws are designed to eliminate abusive deceptive and unfair debt collection practices and may require licensing at the state level if we fail to comply with any of these laws to the extent they are applicable to us we may be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

with respect to our business and consumer solutions segment because each distributor offers prepaid cards reload services andor money remittance services as an agent of business and consumer solutions or another third party we do not believe that the distributors themselves are required to become licensed as money transmitters in order to engage in such activity however there is a risk that a federal or state regulator will take a contrary position and initiate enforcement or other proceedings against a distributor us our issuing banks or our other service providers if we are unsuccessful in making a persuasive argument that a distributor should not be subject to such licensing requirements and it is therefore deemed to be in violation of one or more of the state money transmitter statutes it could result in the imposition of fines the suspension of the distributor’s ability to offer some or all of our related services in the relevant jurisdiction civil liability and criminal liability each of which could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations furthermore if the federal government or one or more state governments impose additional legislative or regulatory requirements on our business and consumer solutions segment the issuing banks or the distributors or prohibit or limit the activities of our business and consumer solutions segment as currently conducted we may be required to modify or terminate some or all of our business and consumer solutions services offered in the relevant jurisdiction or certain of the issuing banks may terminate their relationship with us moreover as a number of our business and consumer solutions distributors are engaged in offering payday title andor installment loans current and future legislative and regulatory restrictions that negatively affect their ability to continue their operations could have a corresponding negative effect on our revenue and earnings from these relationships potentially resulting in a significant decline in revenue from the business and consumer solutions segment 

changes to legal rules and regulations or interpretation or enforcement thereof even if not directed at us may require significant efforts to change our systems and services and may require changes to how we price our services to customers adversely affecting our business even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness could damage our business or our reputation 

new or revised tax regulations unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense 

changes in tax laws or their interpretations could result in changes to enacted tax rates and may require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the new or revised tax regulations and significant estimates in calculations as well as the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced future changes in enacted tax rates could negatively affect our results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows we have recognized estimated liabilities on the balance sheet for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial amount no more than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk 

we operate in a rapidly changing industry accordingly our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify monitor and manage our risks if our policies and procedures are not fully effective or if we are not always successful in identifying and mitigating all risks to which we are or may be exposed we may suffer uninsured liability harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

financial risks 

we are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows and we may not effectively hedge against these risks 

a portion of our current indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate and we may incur additional variablerate indebtedness in the future increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or dividends 

we are also subject to risks related to the changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar revenues and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in currency exchange rates volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results 

in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currencies into us dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates through the use of hedging arrangements to the extent that we hedge our interest rate or currency exchange rate exposures we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates or currency exchange rates were to change in our favor developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and currency exchange rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition a counterparty to the arrangement could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate these arrangements 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

we currently maintain investment credit ratings with moodys investors service and standard  poors ratings services unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively affect our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the capital markets could become restricted and our relationships with certain customers of our issuer solutions segment could also be affected future tightening in the credit markets and a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt additionally our credit facilities include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded 

the alteration or replacement of the london interbank offered rate libor benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our current indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor and we may incur additional variable indebtedness based on libor furthermore we have entered into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the libor benchmark interest rate in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the united kingdom stated that they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor interest rates indices the fca has indicated they will support the libor indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate it is possible that the ice benchmark administration limited formerly nyse euronext rate administration limited and the panel banks which contribute to libor could continue to produce libor on the current basis after 2021 the ice benchmark administration limited recently announced that it will consult on its intention to extend the publication of most tenors libor to june 30 2023 the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 at this time it is not possible to predict when libor will be replaced as the reference rate in the agreements governing the company’s indebtedness and hedging agreements or the effect any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or the establishment of alternative reference rates such as sofr or any other reference rate will have on the company however if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form the company’s borrowing costs may be adversely affected 

failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including but not limited to preventing unauthorized access to our systems we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting furthermore this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we have completed or may complete 

in certain markets including without limitation china and spain our member sponsors perform payment processing operations and related support services pursuant to services agreements we expect that the member sponsors will continue to provide these services until such time as we may integrate these functions into our operations accordingly we rely on our member sponsors to provide financial data such as amounts billed to merchants to assist us with compiling our accounting records as such our internal control over financial reporting could be materially affected or is reasonably likely to be materially affected by the internal control and procedures of our member sponsors in these markets 

while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective internal control over financial reporting failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the markets perception of our business and on our stock price 

intellectual property risks 

we may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims 

in our rapidly developing legal framework we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology despite our efforts to protect our intellectual 

property third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or may develop software or technology that competes with ours our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property rights we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights trade secrets and knowhow or to determine their scope validity or enforceability which is expensive and could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove to be successful the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete 

we may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our services and technology infringe upon another party’s proprietary rights third parties may have or may eventually be issued patents that could be infringed by our services or technology any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our services or technology we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright trademark or license usage rights any such claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could limit our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and require us to design around a third party’s patent which may not be possible or to license alternative technology from another party which may be costly in addition such litigation is often time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our employees 

risks related to our capital structure 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect us and limit our business flexibility 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur other debt in the future our level of debt and the covenants to which we agreed could have negative consequences on us including among other things 1 requiring us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of the debt 2 limiting funds available for strategic initiatives and opportunities working capital and other general corporate needs and 3 limiting our ability to incur certain kinds or amounts of additional indebtedness which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our business our industry and economic conditions 

we may not be able to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs 

we may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs including developing new products and technologies or to fund future acquisitions or operating needs if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock we may also decide to issue securities including debt securities that have rights preferences and privileges senior to our common stock we may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all if financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our future needs this may prevent us from increasing our market share capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets the impairment of a portion of these assets could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a result of our acquisitions a significant portion of our total assets are intangible assets including goodwill goodwill and intangible assets net of amortization together accounted for approximately 81 of our total assets as of december 31 2020 we expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets including goodwill we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired under current accounting rules any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to record an impairment charge which would negatively affect our earnings an impairment of a portion of our goodwill or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able to or we may decide not to pay dividends or repurchase shares at a level anticipated by our shareholders which could reduce shareholder returns 

  

the extent to which we pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other factors our results of operations financial condition capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant no assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends or repurchase any shares in the foreseeable future 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

our business has been and will likely continue to be negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in the financial markets we experienced revenue declines in fiscal 2020 related to covid19 due to a reduction in spending and closures of or slowdowns of certain of our customer businesses throughout north america europe and asia pacific while we expect the covid19 pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings in 2021 we do expect a steady and progressive economic recovery throughout the year 

we have experienced and may continue to experience adverse effects due to a number of operational factors including but not limited to 

• thirdparty disruptions due to covid19 including potential outages and service effects at network providers call centers and other suppliers due to restrictions or closures imposed in relation to the pandemic 

• increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to covid19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption given increased online banking ecommerce remote work and other online activity and 

• challenges to the availability and reliability of our solutions and services due to changes to operations including the possibility of one or more clusters of covid19 cases occurring at our facilities affecting key employees or a significant portion of our workforce or third parties on which we depend 

• increased operational business continuity and cybersecurity risk resulting from the significant increase in the number of our employees working remotely as a result of the pandemic additionally covid19 could require new or modified processes procedures and controls to respond to changes in our business environment 

any of these developments may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided the full effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict at this time such developments include but are not limited to the ultimate severity scope and duration of the pandemic and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness the availability and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines and how soon and to what extent normal economic conditions operations and demand for our services can resume the continued spread of covid19 has caused an economic slowdown and recession in the united states and other markets in which we operate and it is possible that it could cause a global recession it may also affect financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely affect our access to financing or the terms of any such financing moreover the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic may persist for an indefinite period even after the pandemic has subsided accordingly the ultimate effects on our operations financial condition and cash flows cannot be determined at this time 

in addition many of the other risk factors described herein are heightened by the effects of the covid 19 pandemic and related economic conditions which in turn could materially adversely affect our business financial condition access to financing results of operations and liquidity 

risks related to general economic conditions 

we are subject to economic and geopolitical risk the business cycles and credit risk of our customers and the overall level of consumer business and government spending which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global payments technology industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer business and government spending we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence spending and discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions made using electronic payments a reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenues and profits if our merchants make fewer sales to consumers using electronic payments or consumers using electronic payments spend less per transaction we will have fewer transactions to process or lower transaction amounts each of which would contribute to lower revenues additionally credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and 

become more selective in their card issuance practices any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

a downturn in the economy could force merchants financial institutions or other customers to close or petition for bankruptcy protection resulting in lower revenue and earnings for us and greater exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines we also have a certain amount of fixed costs including rent debt service and salaries which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy changes in economic conditions could also adversely affect our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

reject losses arise from the fact that in most markets we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period this results in the buildup of a substantial receivable from our customers if a merchant were to go out of business during the billing period we may be unable to collect such fees which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our business growth financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic conditions inflation changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict or action by the united states or foreign governments that may restrict our ability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities a possible slowdown in global trade caused by increasing tariffs or other restrictions could decrease consumer or corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending in countries inside or outside the united states which could adversely affect our operations 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom ceased to be a member state of the european union brexit with a transition period that ended on december 31 2020 during the transition period existing arrangements between the uk and the eu remained in place following the transition period the uk is no longer a part of the eu single market in december 2020 the uk and eu announced they had entered into a postbrexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues this new agreement could potentially avoid some of the anticipated disruption of the uk’s exit from the eu while we have not experienced significant adverse effects on our uk business and its financial condition results of operations and cash flows to date as a result of the new deal no assurance can be given regarding the potential future effects of the agreed brexit trade deal and our uk business and our financial conditions results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

general risk factors 

if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow our business could be adversely affected 

all of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological social economic and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital to successfully compete and grow we must recruit develop and retain personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of intellectual capital needs in addition we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital however the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors we cannot assure that key personnel including executive officers will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

effects of covid19 on our business 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of the covid19 virus a global pandemic during 2020 and continuing into 2021 the global economy has been and continues to be affected by covid19 the pandemic has caused and may continue to cause significant disruptions to businesses and markets worldwide as the virus continues to spread or has a resurgence in certain jurisdictions the pandemic and measures to prevent its spread affected our financial results during 2020 as governments took actions to encourage social distancing and implement shelterinplace directives spending and transaction volumes decreased beginning in midmarch 2020 we saw improvement in our financial results and positive trends during the latter half of 2020 as certain state and local governments in the united states and abroad began to gradually ease restrictions certain businesses reopened and spending increased while we continue to see signs of economic recovery the 

rate of recovery has been affected by the recent reinstatement of restrictions in certain jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally due to a resurgence of the virus 

we have taken a number of actions to preserve our available capital and provide financial flexibility in response to the effects of covid19 on our business including temporarily suspending our share repurchase program during the second and third quarters of 2020 and reducing our planned capital investments in the business we also implemented costsaving actions such as reductions in employee compensation costs and discretionary spending to help mitigate the financial effects of the covid19 pandemic we continue to closely monitor the evolving effects of the covid19 pandemic however the implications on future global economic conditions and related effects on our business and financial condition are difficult to predict due to uncertainties around the ultimate severity scope and duration of the pandemic the availability and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines and the direction or extent of current or future restrictive actions that may be imposed by governments or public health authorities while we expect the covid19 pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues and earnings in 2021 we do expect a steady and progressive recovery throughout the year 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could affect our future operating results related to the effects of the covid19 pandemic see “item 1a – risk factors” 

emerging trends 

the payments technology industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result certain large payment technology companies including us have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures we expect to continue to expand into new markets internationally and increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing additional acquisitions and joint ventures 

the industry continues to grow as a result of wider merchant acceptance and increased use of credit and debit cards advances in payment processing technology and migration to ecommerce omnichannel and contactless payment solutions the proliferation of credit and debit cards as well as other digital payment solutions has made the acceptance of electronic payments a virtual necessity for many businesses regardless of size in order to remain competitive further the expanding digitization of the economy and availability and access to financial services increases the demand for cards and electronic payments which in turn drives growth in acceptance and transaction volumes 

the outbreak of the covid19 virus in 2020 introduced numerous economic and operational challenges for many industries and businesses however the outbreak has also accelerated the use of electronic payments the need for development of technologies and electronicbased solutions and expansion of ecommerce omnichannel and contactless payment solutions we believe that the number of electronic payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies as a result we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies 

we also believe new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paperbased transactions we expect industries such as education government and healthcare as well as recurring payments and businesstobusiness payments to continue to see transactions migrate to electronicbased solutions we anticipate that the continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future

senior unsecured credit facilities 

we have a term loan credit agreement term loan credit agreement and a revolving credit agreement unsecured revolving credit agreement in each case with bank of america na as administrative agent and a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and other agents the term loan credit agreement provides for a senior unsecured 20 billion term loan facility and the unsecured revolving credit agreement provides for a senior unsecured 30 billion revolving credit facility borrowings under the term loan facility were made in us dollars and borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available to be made in us dollars euros sterling canadian dollars and subject to certain conditions certain other currencies at our option borrowings in us dollars and certain other london interbank offered rate liborquoted currencies will bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either 1 the rate adjusted for any statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities for eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market 2 a floating rate of interest set forth on the applicable libor screen page designated by bank of america or 3 the highest of a the federal funds effective rate plus 05 b the rate of interest as publicly announced by bank of america as its prime rate or c libor plus 10 in each case plus an applicable margin as of december 31 2020 borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility were 20 billion and 360 million respectively 

we continue to monitor developments related to the anticipated transition from libor to an alternative benchmark reference rate such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr beginning january 1 2022 additionally we maintain contact with our lenders and other stakeholders to evaluate the potential effects of these changes on any future financing activities 

as of december 31 2020 the interest rates on the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility were 152 and 148 respectively  in addition we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee with respect to the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at an applicable rate per annum ranging from 0125 to 0300 depending on our credit rating beginning on december 31 2022 and at the end of each quarter thereafter the term loan facility must be repaid in quarterly installments in the amount of 250 of original principal through the maturity date with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in september 2024 the revolving credit facility also matures in september 2024 

we may issue standby letters of credit of up to 250 million in the aggregate under the revolving credit facility outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us the amounts available to borrow under the revolving credit facility are also determined by a financial leverage covenant as of december 31 2020 the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility were 21 billion 

bridge facility 

on may 27 2019 in connection with our entry into the merger agreement with tsys we obtained commitments for a 275 billion 364day senior unsecured bridge facility the bridge facility on july 9 2019 upon our entry into the senior unsecured term loan and revolving credit facilities described below the aggregate commitments under the bridge facility were reduced to approximately 21 billion concurrently with the issuance of our senior unsecured notes the remaining aggregate commitments under the bridge facility were reduced to zero and terminated during the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized 117 million of fees associated with the bridge facility in interest expense 

compliance with covenants 

the senior unsecured term loan and revolving credit facilities contain customary conditions to funding affirmative covenants negative covenants financial covenants and events of default as of december 31 2020 financial covenants under the term loan facility required a leverage ratio of 350 to 100 and an interest coverage ratio of 300 to 100 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 31 2020 

settlement lines of credit 

in various markets where we do business we have specialized lines of credit which are restricted for use in funding settlement the settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may in some cases facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies for certain of our lines of credit the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender accordingly the amount of the outstanding line of credit may exceed the stated credit limit as of december 31 2020 and 2019 a total of 645 million an d 745 million respectively of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit 

as of december 31 2020 w e had 3587 million outs tanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity to fund settlement of 15076 million during the year ended december 31 2020 the maximum and average outstanding balances under these lines of credit wer e 7525 million and 3414 million respectively the weightedaverage interest rate on these borrowings was 235 at december 31 2020 

see note 6—leases and note 8—longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our borrowing agreements and our lease liabilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources other than the guarantee services described in note 1  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

binica agreements 

  

we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks these agreements allow us to use the banks identification numbers referred to as bank identification number bin for visa transactions and interbank card association ica number for mastercard transactions to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard certain of such agreements contain financial covenants and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2020 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes estimates of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2020 



1 interest on longterm debt is based on effective rates and amounts borrowed as of december 31 2020 and includes the estimated effect of interest rate swaps since the contractual rates for our longterm debt and settlements on our interest rate swaps are variable actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided 

2 operating lease obligations did not include approximately 1475 million for operating leases that had not yet commenced at december 31 2020 finance lease obligations did not include approximately 181 million for finance leases that has not yet commenced as of december 31 2020 

3 includes an estimate of future payments for noncancelable contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts 

the table above excludes other obligations that we may have such as employee benefit obligations and other noncurrent liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet because the timing of the related payments is not determinable or because there is no contractual obligation associated with the underlying obligations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management and as a result actual future developments may be different from those expected at the time that we make these critical judgments we have discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions therefore the following descriptions of our critical accounting policies are forwardlooking statements and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forwardlooking statements you should read the following in conjunction with note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the accompanying 

consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in item 1a  risk factors of this annual report on form 10k 

business combinations 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position the measurement principle for the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination is at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date with certain exceptions the excess of the total consideration transferred over the amount of the net identifiable assets acquired determined in accordance with the measurement guidance for such items is recorded as goodwill 

the estimates we use to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets the estimated fair values of customerrelated and contractbased intangible assets are generally determined using the income approach which is based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows the discount rates used represented a risk adjusted market participant weightedaverage cost of capital derived using customary market metrics these measures of fair value also require considerable judgments about future events including forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted customer attrition rates contract renewal estimates and technology changes acquired technologies are generally valued using the replacement cost method which requires us to estimate the costs to construct an asset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence trademarks and trade names are generally valued using the relieffromroyalty approach this method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenues for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weightedaverage cost of capital this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the period over which to recognize the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible assets as an expense certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill — we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 each year we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative assessment for impairment is necessary the option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit 

factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of our reporting units events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entityspecific events if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount a quantitative test would be required 

the quantitative assessment compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit when applying the quantitative assessment we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighted average of multiple valuation techniques principally a combination of an income approach and a market approach the income approach calculates a value based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows while the market approach uses earnings multiples of similarly situated guideline public companies determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions  

our reporting units consist of the following north america payment solutions integrated solutions vertical market software solutions europe merchant solutions spain merchant solutions asiapacific merchant solutions issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions as of october 1 2020 we performed a quantitative assessment of impairment for our issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions reporting units and a qualitative assessment for all other reporting units we determined on the basis of the quantitative assessment of our issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions reporting units that the fair value of each reporting unit is equal to or greater than its respective carrying amount additionally we determined on the basis of the qualitative factors that the fair value of other reporting units was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts our current year assessments also included consideration of the expected near term effects of the covid19 pandemic on revenues and our cost mitigation efforts as well as longer term performance expectations we believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount except for issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions for which the respective carrying amounts approximate fair value since they were recently acquired in the merger 

intangible and longlived assets — intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives the useful lives for customerrelated intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows which include estimates for the revenues expenses and customer attrition associated with the assets the useful lives of contractbased intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements the useful lives of amortizable trademarks and trade names are based on an estimate of the period over which we will earn revenues for the related brands including contemplation of any future plans to phase out the trademarks and trade names in the applicable markets 

we use the straightline method of amortization for our amortizable acquired technologies trademarks and trade names and contractbased intangibles amortization for most of our customerrelated intangible assets is determined using an accelerated method under this accelerated method the first step in determining the amortization expense for any period is that we divide the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquisitiondate fair value of the asset divided by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset we then multiply that ratio by the initial carrying amount of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates we adjust the amortization schedule prospectively we believe that our accelerated method reflects the expected pattern of the benefit to be derived from the acquired customer relationships we did not make any significant adjustments to the amortization schedules of our intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2020 

we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable when factors indicate that these longlived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such longlived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition the evaluation is performed at the asset group level which is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the carrying amount of the asset group is determined not to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recorded measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may warrant revision 

capitalization of internaluse software 

we develop software that is used in providing services to customers capitalization of internaluse software primarily associated with operating platforms occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage management authorizes the project management commits to funding the project it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives the evaluation of alternatives the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are recognized as expense as incurred currently unforeseen circumstances in software development such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs the carrying amount of internaluse software including workinprogress at december 31 2020 was 6063 million costs capitalized during the year ended december 31 2020 totaled 2303 million internaluse software is amortized over its estimated useful life which is typically 2 to 10 years in a manner that best reflects the pattern of economic use of the assets 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we preliminarily determined our target technology architecture for the combined company as a result we wroteoff capitalized software assets of 311 million related to legacy global payments technology that will no longer be utilized 

revenue recognition 

in accordance with accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 we apply judgment in the determination of performance obligations in particular related to large customer contracts within the issuer solutions segment performance obligations in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us and are distinct in the context of the contract whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract to the extent a contract includes multiple promised services we must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract if these criteria are not met the promised services are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation in addition a single performance obligation may comprise a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer 

income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using managements judgments estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable however we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized when facts and circumstances change including an effective settlement of an issue or statute of limitations expiration the effect is recognized in the period of change the unrecognized tax benefits that exist at december 31 2020 would affect our provision for income taxes in the future if recognized judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized to the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made 

effect of new accounting pronouncements  recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted 

from timetotime new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standards setting bodies that may affect our current andor future financial statements refer to note 1—basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies consequently a portion of our revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not historically hedged our translation risk on foreign currency exposure but we may do so in the future for the year ended december 31 2020 currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our consolidated revenues by approximately 49 million and reduced our operating income by approximately 05 million compared to the prior year calculated by converting revenues and operating income respectively for the current year excluding revenues and operating income from current year acquisitions in local currencies using exchange rates for the prior year 

generally the functional currency of our various subsidiaries is their local currency we are exposed to currency fluctuations on transactions that are not denominated in the functional currency gains and losses on such transactions are included in determining net income for the period we seek to mitigate our foreign currency risk through timely settlement of transactions and cash flow matching when possible for the year ended december 31 2020 our transaction gains and losses were insignificant 

additionally we are affected by currency fluctuations in our funds settlement process on merchant payment chargeback and card network settlement transactions that are not denominated in the currency of the underlying credit or debit card transaction gains and losses on these transactions are included in revenues for the period 

we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on our investments in foreign operations relative to our net investment in foreign operations the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the periodend rate of exchange the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and is included in shareholders equity transaction gains and losses on intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature are also recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on certain of our longterm borrowings and cash investments we invest our excess cash in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 

we have a senior unsecured 20 billion term loan facility and a senior unsecured 30 billion revolving credit facility as well as various lines of credit that we use to fund settlement in certain of our markets each of which bears interest at rates that are based on market rates and fluctuate accordingly as of december 31 2020 the amount outstanding under these variablerate debt arrangements and settlement lines of credit was 24 billion 

the interest earned on our invested cash and the interest paid on our debt are based on variable interest rates therefore the exposure of our net income to a change in interest rates is partially mitigated as an increase in rates would increase both interest income and interest expense and a reduction in rates would decrease both interest income and interest expense under our current policies we may selectively use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements to manage all or a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes we have entered into interest rate swaps that reduce a portion of our exposure to market interest rate risk on certain of our variablerate debt as discussed in note 8—longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

based on balances outstanding under variablerate debt agreements and invested cash balances at december 31 2020 a hypothetical increase of 50 basis points in applicable interest rates as of december 31 2020 would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 38 million and increase our annual interest income by approximately 19 million

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the internal control — integrated framework 2013  

based on the results of its evaluation management believes that as of december 31 2020 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk

credit and debit card transaction processing 

credit and debit card transaction processing includes the processing of the worlds major international card brands including american express discover card discover jcb mastercard unionpay international upi and visa as well as certain domestic debit networks such as interac in canada credit and debit networks establish uniform regulations that govern much of the payment card industry during a typical payment transaction the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other but instead rely on payments technology companies such as global payments to facilitate transaction processing services including authorization electronic draft capture file transfers to facilitate funds settlement and certain exceptionbased back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 

we process funds settlement under two models a sponsorship model and a direct membership model under the sponsorship model member clearing financial institutions members sponsor us and require our adherence to the standards of the networks in certain markets we have sponsorship or depository and clearing agreements with financial institution sponsors these agreements allow us to route transactions under the members control and identification numbers to clear card transactions through mastercard and visa in this model the standards of the card networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds and instead require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant has been funded 

under the direct membership model we are direct members in various payment networks allowing us to process and fund transactions without thirdparty sponsorship in this model we route and clear transactions directly through the card brand’s network and are not restricted from performing funds settlement otherwise we process these transactions similarly to how we process transactions in the sponsorship model we are required to adhere to the standards of the various networks in which we are direct members we maintain relationships with financial institutions which may also serve as our member sponsors for other card brands or in other markets to assist with funds settlement 

how a card transaction works 

a typical payment transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location where the card information is captured by a pointofsale pos terminal card reader or mobile device card reader which may be sold or leased to the merchant and serviced by us alternatively card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device or ecommerce portal by one of a number of services that we offer directly or through a valueadded reseller the card reader electronically records sales draft information such as the card identification number transaction date and transaction amount 

after the card and transaction information is captured the pos device automatically connects to our network through the internet or other communication channel in order to receive authorization of the transaction for a credit card transaction authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction amount will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits in a debit card transaction we obtain authorization for the transaction from the card issuer through the payment network verifying that the cardholder has access to sufficient funds for the transaction amount 

as an illustration shown below on a 10000 card transaction the card issuer may fund the member our sponsor indirectly through the card network 9850 after retaining approximately 150 referred to as an interchange fee the card issuer seeks reimbursement of 10000 from the cardholder in the cardholders monthly credit card statement the member would in turn pay the merchant 10000 the net settlement after this transaction would require us to advance the member 150 after the end of the month we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction amount or merchant discount to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our fee from the transaction if our discount rate for the merchant in the above example was 200 we would bill the merchant 200 after the end of the month for the transaction reimburse ourselves for 150 in interchange fees and retain 050 as our fees for the transaction under some arrangements we remit the net amount 

of 9800 to the merchant rather than funding the full 10000 and subsequently billing the merchant at the end of the month discount rates vary based on negotiations with merchants and the economic characteristics of transactions interchange rates also vary based on the economic characteristics of individual transactions accordingly our fee per transaction varies across our merchant base and is subject to change based on changes in discount rates and interchange rates our profit on the transaction reflects the fee received less payment network fees and operating expenses including systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or iso payment network fees are charged by the card brands in part based on the value of transactions processed through their networks

competition 

our merchant solutions segment competes with financial institutions and merchant acquirers who provide businesses with merchant acquiring services and related services we believe that as of december 31 2019 we were one of the largest merchant acquirers in the small and mediumsized business segment merchants who have less than 5 million in annual bankcard sales volume in the united states in the united states we compete primarily with fiserv inc and its alliances fiserv fidelity national information services inc fis chase paymentech solutions llc elavon inc a subsidiary of us bancorp wells fargo bank na and square inc while these are our primary competitors some of our vertically focused business in the united states compete with other organizations 

internationally financial institutions remain the primary providers of payment technology services to merchants although the outsourcing of these services to thirdparty service providers is becoming more prevalent payment services have become increasingly complex requiring significant capital commitments to develop maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at competitive prices in addition to financial institutions competitors in europe include ayden nv and fis 

our issuer solutions segment encounters competition from credit card processing firms thirdparty card processing software vendors and various other firms that provide products and services to credit card issuers in the united states and internationally the united states market for thirdparty processing for credit card issuers is primarily serviced by three vendors including tsys with our largest competitor being a subsidiary of fiserv we believe that as of december 31 2019 we were the largest thirdparty processor for credit card issuers in north america and one of the largest in europe based on net revenue derived from solutions for credit card issuers 

our business and consumer solutions segment primarily competes with other demand deposit account and prepaid debit account program managers to provide financial service solutions to the underbanked and other consumers and businesses our primary competitors in this space include green dot corporation incomm and fiserv as of december 31 2019 we believe that we were one of the two largest prepaid program managers in the united states based on gross dollar volume total spending on the accounts we manage processed during 2019

doddfrank act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act restricts the amounts of debit card fees that certain institutions can charge merchants pursuant to regulations promulgated by the federal reserve board debit interchange rates for card issuers with assets of 10 billion or more are capped at 021 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuers fraud losses plus for qualifying issuers an additional 001 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs 

in addition the doddfrank act limits the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions because it allows merchants to i set minimum dollar amounts not to exceed 10 for the acceptance of a credit card and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and ii provide discounts or incentives to encourage consumers to pay with cash checks debit cards or credit cards 

the rules also contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions that require a card issuer to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements and restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements the prohibition on network exclusivity has not significantly affected our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our customers nor do we expect it to in the future 

the doddfrank act also created the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws and the financial stability oversight council which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company such as us should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve on the ground that it is systemically important to the us financial system accordingly we may be subject to additional systemic riskrelated oversight

in many countries we are legally or contractually required to comply with the antimoney laundering laws and regulations such as in the united states the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act collectively the bank secrecy act and similar laws of other countries which require that customer identifying information be obtained and verified in some countries we are directly subject to these requirements in other countries we have contractually agreed to assist our sponsor financial institutions with their obligation to comply with antimoney laundering requirements that apply to them in addition we and our sponsor financial institutions are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by the office of foreign assets control ofac which prohibit us persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons or entities similar requirements apply in other countries we have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments and that allow our customers to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries individuals or entities

risks related to our business and operations 

our ability to protect our systems and data from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks could affect our reputation among our customers and cardholders adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial institution sponsorship and may expose us to penalties fines liabilities and legal claims 

in order to provide our services we process and store sensitive business information and personal information which may include credit and debit card numbers bank account numbers social security numbers driver’s license numbers names and addresses and other types of personal information or sensitive business information some of this information is also processed and stored by financial institutions merchants and other entities as well as thirdparty service providers to whom we outsource certain functions and other agents which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties we may have responsibility to the card networks financial institutions and in some instances our merchants isos andor individuals for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties as applicable to protect this information 

we are a regular target of malicious thirdparty attempts to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities andor penetrate or bypass our security measures in order to gain unauthorized access to our networks and systems or those of our associated third parties such access could lead to the compromise of sensitive business personal or confidential information as a result we follow a defenseindepth model for cybersecurity meaning we proactively seek to employ multiple methods at different layers to defend our systems against intrusion and attack and to protect the data we collect however we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats 

our computer systems andor our associated third parties’ computer systems could be subject to penetration and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect and continually evolve and become more sophisticated threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties including statesponsored organizations with significant financial and technological resources computer viruses and other malware can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities our defensive measures may not prevent downtime unauthorized access or use of sensitive data while we maintain first and thirdparty insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses companies we acquire may require postclosing implementation of additional cyber defense methods to align with our standards and as a result there may be a period of increased risk between the closing of an acquisition and the completion of such implementation further certain of our thirdparty relationships are subject to our vendor management program and governed by written contracts however we do not control the actions of our associated third parties and any problems experienced by these third parties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in the services provided by such parties or cyberattacks and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to service our customers or otherwise conduct our business 

in addition we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to use security and privacy that we impose on our associated third parties who have access to this data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the misuse of this data any misuse or compromise of personal information or failure to adequately enforce these contractual requirements could result in liability protracted and costly litigation and with respect to misuse of personal information of our customers lost revenue and reputational harm 

any type of security breach attack or misuse of data described above or otherwise whether experienced by us or an associated third party could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services or from making electronic payments generally increase our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the incident expose us to unanticipated or uninsured liability disrupt our operations including potential service interruptions distract our management increase our risk of litigation or regulatory scrutiny result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state federal and foreign laws or by the card networks and adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial institution 

sponsorship our removal from networks lists of payment card industry data security standard compliant service providers could mean that existing customers sales partners or other third parties may cease using or referring our services also prospective merchant customers financial institutions sales partners or other third parties may choose to terminate negotiations with us or delay or choose not to consider us for their processing needs in addition the card networks could refuse to allow us to process through their networks 

the payments technology industry is highly competitive and some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do which may give them an advantage with respect to the pricing of services offered to customers and the ability to develop new technologies 

we operate in the payments technology industry which is highly competitive in this industry our primary competitors include other independent payment processors credit card processing firms as well as financial institutions isos prepaid programs managers and potentially card networks we compete with many larger companies that have greater financial and operational resources than we have our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a direct member for participation in the card networks as we do in certain jurisdictions and may be able to settle transactions more quickly for merchants than we can these financial institutions may also provide payment processing services to merchants at a loss in order to generate banking fees from the merchants it is also possible that larger financial institutions could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide these attributes may provide them with a competitive advantage in the market 

additionally the market for prepaid cards demand deposit accounts and alternative financial services is similarly highly competitive and competition is increasing as more companies endeavor to address the needs of underbanked consumers we anticipate increased competition from alternative financial services providers who are often well positioned to service the underbanked and who may wish to develop their own prepaid card or demand deposit account programs we also face strong price competition to stay competitive we may have to increase the incentives that we offer to our distributors and reduce the prices of our services which could adversely affect our financial position operating results or cash flows 

furthermore we are facing increasing competition from nontraditional competitors including new entrant technology companies who offer certain innovations in payment methods some of these competitors utilize proprietary software and service solutions some of these nontraditional competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers in addition some nontraditional competitors such as private companies or startup companies may be less risk averse than we are and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to market demands if these nontraditional competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these competitors may compete in ways that minimize or remove the role of traditional card networks acquirers issuers and processors in the electronic payments process 

in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings we must continually and quickly update our services a process that could result in higher costs and the loss of revenues earnings and customers if the new services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 

the payments technology industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in a number of projects including the development of a new authorization platform mobile payment applications ecommerce services and other new offerings emerging in the payments technology industry these projects carry the risks associated with any development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance problems in the payments technology markets these risks are even more acute any delay in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate our services could render our services less desirable to customers or possibly even obsolete furthermore as the market for alternative payment processing services evolves it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new services targeted at this market 

in addition certain of the services we deliver to the payments technology markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions all at very high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses as a result of these factors our development efforts could result in higher costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenues and earnings if promised new services are not delivered timely to our customers or do not perform as anticipated we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies 

our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa cards and mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registrations financial institution sponsorship and in some cases continued membership in certain card networks 

  

in order to provide our visa and mastercard transaction processing services we must be either a direct member or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of visa and mastercard respectively registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of each organization in certain jurisdictions if our sponsor financial institution in any market should stop providing sponsorship for us we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers and potential customers in that market which would negatively affect our revenues earnings and cash flows furthermore some agreements with our financial institution sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants our sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in connection with direct membership the rules and regulations of various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would limit our use of capital for other purposes 

the termination of our registration or any changes in the visa or mastercard rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing visa and mastercard payment processing services which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale the rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issuers and some of those issuers also provide acquiring services and are our competitors or our customers in both the merchant solutions and issuer solutions segments if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks the card networks could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations or membership the termination of our registrations or our membership or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows if a merchant or an iso fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks we or the merchant or iso could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks if we cannot collect or pursue collection of such amounts from the applicable merchant or iso we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties resulting in lower earnings for us 

our business and consumer solutions segment relies on certain relationships with issuing banks distributors marketers and brand partners the loss of such relationships or if we are unable to maintain such relationships on terms that are favorable to us may materially adversely affect our business financial position operating results or cash flows 

our business and consumer solutions segment relies on arrangements that we have with issuing banks to provide us with critical products and services including the fdicinsured depository accounts tied to the cards and accounts we manage access to the atm networks membership in the card associations and network organizations and other banking services the majority of our active business and consumer solutions cards and accounts are issued or opened through meta payment systems metabank if any material adverse event were to affect metabanks or another of our critical issuing banks or we were to lose metabank or another critical bank or metabank or another critical bank grew to a size such that it was no longer able to avail itself of certain regulatory exemptions for small banks we would be forced to find an alternative provider for these critical banking services it may not be possible to find a replacement bank on terms that are acceptable to us or at all any change in the issuing banks could disrupt the business or result in arrangements with new banks that are less favorable to us than those we have with our existing issuing banks either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial position operating results or cash flows 

furthermore our business and consumer solutions segment depends in large part on establishing agreements with distributors marketers and brand partners primarily alternative financial services providers as well as grocery and convenience stores and other traditional retailers some of these companies may endeavor to internally develop their own programs or enter into exclusive relationships with our competitors to distribute or market their products the loss of or a substantial decrease in revenues from one or more of our top distributors marketers or brand partners could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position operating results or cash flows 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement our business may be adversely affected 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services we must find other financial institutions to provide those services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers which could negatively affect our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our systems or our thirdparty providers systems may fail which could interrupt our service cause us to lose business increase our costs and expose us to liability 

we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems software data centers and telecommunications networks as well as the systems and services of third parties a system outage or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows not only would we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss but we may also be liable to third parties many of our contractual agreements with financial institutions require the payment of penalties if we do not meet certain operating standards our systems and operations or those of our thirdparty providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from among other things fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure terrorist acts war unauthorized entry human error and computer viruses or other defects defects in our systems or those of third parties errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions telecommunications failures or other difficulties including those related to system relocation could result in loss of revenues loss of customers loss of merchant and cardholder data harm to our business or reputation exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities negative publicity additional operating and development costs fines and other sanctions imposed by card networks andor diversion of technical and other resources 

we may experience software defects undetected errors and development delays which could damage customer relations decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability 

our services are based on software and computing systems that often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software services and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation and exposure to liability claims 

in addition we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

increased merchant referral partner or iso attrition could cause our financial results to decline 

we experience attrition in merchant credit and debit card processing volume resulting from several factors including business closures transfers of merchants accounts to our competitors unsuccessful contract renewal negotiations and account closures that we initiate for various reasons such as heightened credit risks or contract breaches by merchants if an iso partner switches to another transaction processor terminates our services internalizes payment processing functions that we perform merges with or is acquired by one of our competitors or shuts down or becomes insolvent we may no longer receive new merchant referrals from the iso and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the iso we cannot predict the level of attrition in the future and it could increase our referral partners are a significant source of new business higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our future growth depends in part on the continued expansion within markets in which we already operate the emergence of new markets and the continued availability of alliance relationships and strategic acquisition opportunities 

our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate the further expansion of these markets the emergence of other markets for payment technology and software solutions and our ability to penetrate these markets as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion we look for acquisition opportunities investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration technological capabilities product offerings and distribution capabilities we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition investment and alliance candidates in the future and if we do they may not provide us with the value and benefits we anticipate 

our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets if we fail to expand into new and existing markets for payment technology and software solutions we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 

  

there may be a decline in the use of cards and other electronic payments as a payment mechanism for consumers or other adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general 

if consumers do not continue to use credit debit or gpr prepaid debit cards or other electronic payment methods of the type we process as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash checks credit cards and debit or gpr prepaid debit cards which is adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows consumer credit risk may make it more difficult or expensive for consumers to gain access to credit facilities such as credit cards regulatory changes may result in financial institutions seeking to charge their customers additional fees for use of credit or debit cards such fees may result in decreased use of credit or debit cards by cardholders in each case our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected we believe future growth in the use of credit debit and gpr prepaid debit cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to use electronic payment methods that we process including credit debit and gpr prepaid debit cards 

consolidation among financial institutions or among retail customers including the merger of our customers with entities that are not our customers or the sale of portfolios by our customers to entities that are not our customers could materially affect our financial position results of operation or cash flows 

our issuer solutions segment has many longterm customer contracts with card issuers consolidation among financial institutions particularly in the area of credit card operations and consolidation in the retail industry is a risk that could negatively affect our existing agreements and future revenues with these customers in addition consolidation among financial institutions has led to an increasingly concentrated customer base which results in a changing customer mix toward larger customers continued consolidation among financial institutions could increase the bargaining power of our current and future customers and further increase our customer concentration consolidation among financial institutions and retail customers and the resulting loss of any significant customer by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

if we do not renew or renegotiate our agreements on favorable terms with our customers within the issuer solutions segment our business will suffer 

a significant amount of our issuer solutions segment revenues is derived from longterm contracts with large customers the financial position of these customers and their willingness to pay for our products and services are affected by general market positions competitive pressures and operating margins within their industries when our longterm contracts expire the time of renewal or renegotiation presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers transition all or a portion of the services we provide inhouse or seek lower rates for our services the loss of our contracts with existing customers or renegotiation of contracts at reduced rates or reduced service levels could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operation or cash flows 

in addition the timing of the conversion of card portfolios of new payment processing customers to our processing systems and the deconversion of existing customers to other systems impacts our revenues and expenses due to a variety of factors conversions and deconversions may not occur as scheduled and this may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

we incur chargeback losses when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse us for chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder if we are unable to collect such amounts from the merchants account or reserve account if applicable or if the merchant refuses or is unable due to closure bankruptcy or other reasons to reimburse us for a chargeback we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder the risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than 

delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment we may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have policies to manage merchantrelated credit risk and often mitigate such risk by requiring collateral and monitoring transaction activity notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

fraud by merchants prepaid cardholders or others and losses from overdrawn cardholder accounts could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others and our prepaid card programs expose us to threats involving the misuse of cards collusion fraud and identity theft criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback losses or cause us to incur other liabilities it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future increases in chargebacks or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to economic and geopolitical risk the business cycles and credit risk of our customers and the overall level of consumer business and government spending which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global payments technology industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer business and government spending we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence consumer spending consumer discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions made using electronic payments a reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenues and profits if our merchants make fewer sales to consumers using electronic payments or consumers using electronic payments spend less per transaction we will have fewer transactions to process or lower transaction amounts each of which would contribute to lower revenues additionally credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

a downturn in the economy could force retailers to close or file bankruptcy resulting in lower revenue and earnings for us and greater exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines we also have a certain amount of fixed and other costs including rent debt service and salaries which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy changes in economic conditions could also adversely affect our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

reject losses arise from the fact that in most markets we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period this results in the buildup of a substantial receivable from our customers if a merchant has gone out of business during the billing period we may be unable to collect such fees which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition our business growth financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic conditions inflation changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict or action by the united states or foreign governments that may restrict our ability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities such as sanctions by or against the russian federation a possible slowdown in global trade caused by increasing tariffs or other restrictions could decrease consumer or corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending in countries inside or outside the united states which could adversely affect our operations 

the referendum in the united kingdom in favor of the united kingdom leaving the european union commonly referred to as brexit has caused and may continue to cause economic uncertainty including volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange fluctuations which may adversely affect the profitability of our uk operations in addition brexit could lead to increased regulatory complexities including without limitation regulation relating to data security privacy and taxation on january 31 2020 the united kingdom ceased to be a member state of the european union as a result of its exit from the eu the uk lost access to the eu single market and to eu trade deals negotiated with other jurisdictions at that time so the longterm effects of brexit will depend on the agreements or arrangements with the european union for the united kingdom to retain 

access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently consequently no assurance can be given about the effect of the outcome on our uk business and its financial conditions results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

increases in card network fees may result in the loss of customers andor a reduction in our earnings 

  

from timetotime the card networks including visa and mastercard increase the fees that they charge processors we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers but this strategy might result in the loss of customers to our competitors who may not pass along the increases thereby reducing our revenues and earnings if competitive practices prevent us from passing along the higher fees to our merchant customers in the future we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby increase our operating costs and reducing our earnings 

any new implementation of or changes made to laws regulations or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable effect on our financial results and our cash flows 

our business is affected by laws and regulations and examinations that affect us and our industry in the countries in which we operate regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years failure to comply with regulations or guidelines may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration the limitation suspension or termination of service and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties including fines or may cause customers or potential customers to be reluctant to do business with us any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition for example we are subject to applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate the payment services directive in europe the code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry in canada issued by canadas department of finance the housing assistance tax act of 2008 in the united states hipaa and other health privacy regulations and a myriad of us federal and state consumer protection laws and state escheat regulations in addition the uk payment systems regulator is conducting a market review of the card acquiring industry we are also subject to examination by the ffiec as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions 

interchange fees are subject to intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide for instance the doddfrank act restricts the amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing institutions can charge merchants and allowing merchants to set minimum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts for different payment methods these types of restrictions could negatively affect the number of debit transactions which would adversely affect our business the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws and the financial stability oversight council which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company such as us should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve on the ground that it is systemically important to the us financial system any such designation would result in increased regulatory burdens on our business which increases our risk profile and may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

all persons offering or providing financial services or products to consumers directly or indirectly can be subject to prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices under the doddfrank act more generally all persons engaged in commerce including but not limited to us and our merchant and financial institution customers are also subject to section 5 of the federal trade commission ftc act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap in addition there are other laws rules and or regulations including the telemarketing sales act that may directly impact us or the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us to investigations fees fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the ftc the cfpb and the states’ attorneys general have the authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in udap or violate other laws rules or regulations and to the extent we are processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities 

in many countries we are legally or contractually required to comply with the antimoney laundering laws and regulations such as in the united states the bank secrecy act and similar laws of other countries which require that customer identifying information be obtained and verified in some countries we are directly subject to these requirements in other countries we have contractually agreed to assist our financial institution customers with their obligation to comply with antimoney laundering requirements that apply to them in addition we and our sponsor financial institutions are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by ofac which prohibit us persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons or entities similar requirements apply in other countries our failure to comply with any of these contractual requirements or laws could adversely affect our business financial credit results of operations and cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of foreign and domestic laws and their implementing regulations which establish requirements for the collection processing storage use and disclosure of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information regulatory authorities around the world are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data privacy and use including the eu general data protection regulation and the california consumer protection act and the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws is increasingly uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data privacy practices or operations model which could result in potential liability for fines damages or a need to incur substantial costs to modify our operations compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming adding a layer of complexity to business practices and innovation as with other regulatory schemes our failure to comply could result in public or private enforcement action and accompanying litigation costs losses fines and penalties 

portions of our business may be subject to the fdcpa the fcra and similar state laws these debt collection laws are designed to eliminate abusive deceptive and unfair debt collection practices and may require licensing at the state level if we fail to comply with any of these laws to the extent they are applicable to us we may be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

with respect to our business and consumer solutions segment because each distributor offers prepaid cards reload services andor money remittance services as an agent of business and consumer solutions or another third party we do not believe that the distributors themselves are required to become licensed as money transmitters in order to engage in such activity however there is a risk that a federal or state regulator will take a contrary position and initiate enforcement or other proceedings against a distributor us our issuing banks or our other service providers if we are unsuccessful in making a persuasive argument that a distributor should not be subject to such licensing requirements and it is therefore deemed to be in violation of one or more of the state money transmitter statutes it could result in the imposition of fines the suspension of the distributor’s ability to offer some or all of our products and related services in the relevant jurisdiction civil liability and criminal liability each of which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations furthermore if the federal government or one or more state governments impose additional legislative or regulatory requirements on our business and consumer solutions segment the issuing banks or the distributors or prohibit or limit the activities of our business and consumer solutions segment as currently conducted we may be required to modify or terminate some or all of our business and consumer solutions products and services offered in the relevant jurisdiction or certain of the issuing banks may terminate their relationship with us moreover as a number of our business and consumer solutions distributors are engaged in offering payday title andor installment loans current and future legislative and regulatory restrictions that negatively impact their ability to continue their operations could have a corresponding negative impact on our revenue and earnings from these relationships potentially resulting in a significant decline in revenue from the business and consumer solutions segment 

changes to legal rules and regulations or interpretation or enforcement thereof even if not directed at us may require significant efforts to change our systems and services and may require changes to how we price our services to customers adversely affecting our business even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness could damage our business or our reputation furthermore we are subject to tax laws in each jurisdiction where we conduct business changes in such laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive the value of tax losses and tax credit carry forwards recorded on our balance sheet and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows and we may not effectively hedge against these risks 

a portion of our current indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate and we may incur additional variablerate indebtedness in the future increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or dividends 

we are also subject to risks related to the changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar revenues and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in currency exchange rates volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results 

in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currencies into us dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates through the use of hedging arrangements to the extent that we hedge our interest rate or currency exchange rate exposures we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates or currency exchange rates were to change in our favor developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and currency exchange rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition a counterparty to the arrangement could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate these arrangements 

a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 

in connection with the merger we achieved an investment grade debt structure unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively affect our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the capital markets could become restricted future tightening in the credit markets and a reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt additionally our credit facilities include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded 

changes in the method for determining the london interbank offered rate libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a portion of our current indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor and we may incur additional variable indebtedness based on libor furthermore we have entered into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the libor benchmark interest rate in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the united kingdom stated that they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor interest rates indices the fca has indicated they will support the libor indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 sofr is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities 

we are evaluating the potential effect of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate including the possibility of sofr as the dominant replacement the market transition away from libor and towards sofr is expected to be gradual and complicated including the development of term and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between libor and sofr introduction of an alternative rate also may introduce additional basis risk for market participants as an alternative index is utilized along with libor there can be no guarantee that sofr will become widely used and that alternatives may or may not be developed with additional complications we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021 whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the effect of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions if any could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 

the acquisition integration and conversion of businesses and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve a number of risks core risks are in the area of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited diligence and integration and conversion managing the complex process of integrating the acquired companys people services information security and technology and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition in addition international acquisitions and alliances often involve additional or increased risks including for example managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures complying with foreign regulatory requirements fluctuations in currency exchange rates enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries difficulty entering new foreign markets due to among other things customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets and general economic and political conditions 

if the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly the following factors among others could reduce our revenues and earnings increase our operating costs and result in us not achieving projected synergies 

 

the costs and effects of pending and future litigation investigations or similar matters or adverse facts and developments related thereto could materially affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

we are from timetotime involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and any claims asserted against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome may harm our reputation furthermore there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims 

in our rapidly developing legal framework we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or may develop software or technology that competes with ours our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property rights we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights trade secrets and knowhow or to determine their scope validity or enforceability which is expensive and could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove to be successful the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete 

we may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our services and technology infringe upon another party’s proprietary rights third parties may have or may eventually be issued patents that would be infringed by our services or technology any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our services or technology we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright trademark or license usage rights any such claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could limit our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and require us to design around a third party’s patent which may not be possible or to license alternative technology from another party which may be costly in addition litigation is often time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our employees 

new or revised tax regulations unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense 

changes in tax laws or their interpretations could result in changes to enacted tax rates and may require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the new or revised tax regulations and significant estimates in calculations as well as the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced future changes in enacted tax rates could negatively affect our results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows we have recognized estimated liabilities on the balance sheet for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks there can be no assurance that in all instances an 

issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial amount no more than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we may become subject to additional us state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our customers in which case our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected 

  

we are or may be subject in various jurisdictions to certain taxes that are not derived based on earnings eg sales gross receipts property valueadded and other business taxes application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and the taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on certain of these topics if we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax cost through to our customers our earnings and cash flows would be negatively affected 

we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations of such laws which have been confirmed through either tax rulings or opinions obtained in various jurisdictions including those related to valueadded taxes in europe changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive and the amount of our cash flows and have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to the merger with tsys 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs in connection with integration activities related to the merger 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial costs and charges in connection with integration activities related to the merger including costs associated with employee termination benefits consulting and other advisory fees as well as asset writeoffs there are a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that may need to be integrated including our business operating platforms and other operational matters as well as integrating our purchasing accounting and finance sales payroll pricing and benefits and other administrative processes while we have assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs moreover many of the costs that will continue to be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these costs could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings these integration costs may result in significant charges against earnings and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present 

combining with tsys may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the success of the merger will depend in part on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining our business with the acquired operations of tsys to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the merger we must successfully integrate and combine our businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized if we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected in addition the actual cost savings and anticipated benefits of the merger could be less than anticipated 

it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers commercial counterparties and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources these integration matters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period 

our future results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations 

following the completion of the merger the size of our business increased significantly our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage this expanded business which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity we may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of our business there can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger 

risks related to our organizational and capital structure 

if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow our business could be adversely affected 

  

all of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological social economic and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital to successfully compete and grow we must recruit develop and retain the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of intellectual capital needs in addition we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital however the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors in addition the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to retain key employees it is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with us we cannot assure that key personnel including executive officers will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect us and limit our business flexibility 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness our level of debt and the covenants to which we agreed could have negative consequences on us including among other things 1 requiring us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of the debt 2 limiting funds available for strategic initiatives and opportunities working capital and other general corporate needs and 3 limiting our ability to incur certain kinds or amounts of additional indebtedness which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our business our industry and economic conditions 

we may not be able to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs 

we may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs including developing new products and technologies or to fund future acquisitions or operating needs if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock we may also decide to issue securities including debt securities that have rights preferences and privileges senior to our common stock we may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all if financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our future needs this may prevent us from increasing our market share capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry

emerging trends 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could affect our continuing operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a in this annual report on form 10k 

the payments technology industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result certain large payment technology companies including us have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures we expect to 

continue to expand into new markets internationally and increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing additional acquisitions and joint ventures 

we believe that the number of electronic payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies as a result we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies however we do not expect our aggregate capital spending to support such technologies to increase materially from our current level of spending 

we also believe new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paperbased transactions we expect industries such as education government and healthcare as well as recurring payments and businesstobusiness payments to continue to see transactions migrate to electronicbased solutions we anticipate that the continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future

prior to completion of the merger we were party to a credit facility agreement with bank of america na as administrative agent and a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and other agents the credit facility provided for secured financing comprised of i a 150 billion revolving credit facility ii a 15 billion term loan iii a 137 billion term loan iv a 1140 billion term loan and v a 5000 million term loan upon the consummation of the merger all borrowings outstanding and other amounts due under the credit facility were repaid and this credit facility was terminated 

compliance with covenants 

the senior unsecured term loan and revolving credit facilities contain customary conditions to funding affirmative covenants negative covenants financial covenants and events of default as of december 31 2019  financial covenants under the term loan facility required a leverage ratio of 350 to 100 and an interest coverage ratio of 300 to 100  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december 31 2019  

settlement lines of credit 

in various markets where we do business we have specialized lines of credit which are restricted for use in funding settlement the settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may in some cases facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies for certain of our lines of credit the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender accordingly the amount of the outstanding line of credit may exceed the stated credit limit as of december 31 2019 and 2018  a total of 745 million and 706 million  respectively of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit 

as of december 31 2019  we had 4632 million outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity to fund settlement of 9818 million  during the year ended december 31 2019  the maximum and average outstanding balances under these lines of credit were 8826 million and 4232 million  respectively the weightedaverage interest rate on these borrowings was 316 at december 31 2019  

see note 6 —leases and note 7 —longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information about our borrowing agreements and our lease liabilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources other than the guarantee services described in note 1 —basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

binica agreements 

  

we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks these agreements allow us to use the banks identification numbers referred to as bank identification number bin for visa transactions and interbank card association ica number for mastercard transactions to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard certain of such agreements contain financial covenants and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2019  

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes estimates of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2019  



1 interest on longterm debt is based on effective rates and amounts borrowed as of december 31 2019 and includes the estimated effect of interest rate swaps since the contractual rates for our longterm debt and settlements on our interest rate swaps are variable actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided 

2 operating lease obligations did not include approximately 640 million for operating leases that had not yet commenced at december 31 2019  

3 includes an estimate of future payments for noncancelable contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts 

the table above excludes other obligations that we may have such as employee benefit obligations and other noncurrent liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet because the timing of the related payments is not determinable or because there is no contractual obligation associated with the underlying obligations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management and as a result actual future developments may be different from those expected at the time that we make these critical judgments we have discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions therefore the following descriptions of our critical accounting policies are forwardlooking statements and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forwardlooking statements you should read the following in conjunction with note 1 —basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in item 1a  risk factors of this annual report on form 10k 

business combinations 

from time to time we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position we record the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date the excess amount of the total consideration paid over the estimated fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

the estimates we use to determine the fair value of longlived assets such as intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgments we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired longlived assets the estimated fair values of customerrelated and contractbased intangible assets are generally determined using the income approach which is based on projected cash flows discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows the discount rates used represented the average estimated value of a market participant’s cost of capital and debt derived using customary market metrics these measures of fair value also require considerable judgments about future events including forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted customer attrition rates contract renewal estimates and technology changes acquired technologies are generally valued using the replacement cost method which requires us to estimate the costs to construct an asset of equivalent utility at prices available at the time of the valuation analysis with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional and economic obsolescence trademarks and trade names are generally valued using the relieffromroyalty approach this method assumes that trademarks and trade names have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenues for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weightedaverage cost of capital this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value a market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefits associated with the trade name 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods the determination of asset lives affects our results of operations as different types of assets have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 

goodwill —we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 each year we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative assessment for impairment is necessary the option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit 

factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of our reporting units events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entityspecific events if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount a quantitative test would be required 

prior to the merger our reporting units consisted of north america payments integrated solutions and vertical markets united kingdom asiapacific central and eastern europe russia and spain as of october 1 2019  we elected to perform a quantitative assessment of impairment for each of these reporting units and determined on the basis of those assessments that the 

fair value of each reporting unit is equal to or greater than its respective carrying amount as of october 1 2019  we had not allocated goodwill associated with the merger to any of our reporting units however no indicators of impairment existed that warranted further evaluation of the provisional goodwill 

after october 1 2019  as a result of the merger we realigned our reporting units based on new executive management and organizational structures so that they consisted of north america payment solutions integrated solutions vertical market software solutions europe merchant solutions spain merchant solutions asiapacific merchant solutions issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions after the reorganization of our reporting units we performed a quantitative assessment of impairment for each of our new reporting units and determined on the basis of those assessments that the fair value of each reporting unit is equal to or greater than its respective carrying amount we believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount except for issuer solutions and business and consumer solutions for which the respective carrying amounts approximate fair value since they were recently acquired in the merger 

intangible and longlived assets —intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives the useful lives for customerrelated intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows which include estimates for the revenues expenses and customer attrition associated with the assets the useful lives of contractbased intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements the useful lives of amortizable trademarks and trade names are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks and trade names in the applicable markets we use the straightline method of amortization for our amortizable acquired technologies trademarks and trade names and contractbased intangibles 

amortization for most of our customerrelated intangible assets is determined using an accelerated method the first step in determining the amortization expense for any period is that we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquisitiondate fair value of the asset divided by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset we then multiply that percentage by the initial carrying amount of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates we adjust the amortization schedule prospectively these cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant number of asset interdependencies that exist in our business we believe that our accelerated method reflects the expected pattern of the benefit to be derived from the acquired customer relationships we did not make any significant adjustments to the amortization schedules of our intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2019  

we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable when factors indicate that these longlived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such longlived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition the evaluation is performed at the asset group level which is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the carrying amount of the asset group is determined not to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recorded measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may warrant revision 

capitalization of internaluse software 

we develop software that is used in providing services to customers capitalization of internaluse software primarily associated with operating platforms occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage management authorizes the project management commits to funding the project it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives the evaluation of alternatives the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred currently unforeseen circumstances in software development such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs the carrying amount of internaluse software including workinprogress at december 31 2019 was 4527 million  costs capitalized during the year ended december 31 2019 totaled 959 million  internaluse software is amortized over its estimated useful life which is typically 2 to 10 years in a manner that best reflects the pattern of economic use of the assets 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 we preliminarily determined our target technology architecture for the combined company as a result we wroteoff capitalized software assets of 311 million related to legacy global payments technology that will no longer be utilized 

revenue recognition 

we adopted accounting standards update 201409 revenues from contracts with customers as well as other clarifications and technical guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board related to this new revenue standard asc 606 and asc subtopic 34040 other assets and deferred costs  contracts with customers on january 1 2018 we apply judgment in the determination of performance obligations in accordance with asc 606 in particular related to large customer contracts within the issuer solutions segment performance obligations in a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us and are distinct in the context of the contract whereby the transfer of the services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract to the extent a contract includes multiple promised services we must apply judgment to determine whether promised services are capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract if these criteria are not met the promised services are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation in addition a single performance obligation may comprise a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer 

income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using managements judgments estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable however we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized when facts and circumstances change including an effective settlement of an issue or statute of limitations expiration the effect is recognized in the period of change the unrecognized tax benefits that exist at december 31 2019 would affect our provision for income taxes in the future if recognized judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized to the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made 

effect of new accounting pronouncements  recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted 

refer to note 1 —basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies consequently a portion of our revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not historically hedged our translation risk on foreign currency exposure but we may do so in the future for the year ended december 31 2019  currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our consolidated revenues by approximately 44 million and reduced our operating income by approximately 21 million compared to the prioryear period calculated by converting revenues and operating income respectively for the current year excluding revenues and operating income from current year acquisitions in local currencies using exchange rates for the prioryear period 

generally the functional currency of our various subsidiaries is their local currency we are exposed to currency fluctuations on transactions that are not denominated in the functional currency gains and losses on such transactions are included in determining 

net income for the period we seek to mitigate our foreign currency risk through timely settlement of transactions and cash flow matching when possible for the year ended december 31 2019  our transaction gains and losses were insignificant 

additionally we are affected by currency fluctuations in our funds settlement process on merchant payment chargeback and card network settlement transactions that are not denominated in the currency of the underlying credit or debit card transaction gains and losses on these transactions are included in revenues for the period 

we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on our investments in foreign operations relative to our net investment in foreign operations the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the periodend rate of exchange the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and is included in shareholders equity transaction gains and losses on intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature are also recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on certain of our longterm borrowings and cash investments we invest our excess cash in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 

we have a senior unsecured 20 billion term loan facility and a senior unsecured 30 billion revolving credit facility as well as various lines of credit that we use to fund settlement in certain of our markets each of which bears interest at rates that are based on market rates and fluctuate accordingly as of december 31 2019  the amount outstanding under these variablerate debt arrangements and settlement lines of credit was 34 billion  

the interest earned on our invested cash and the interest paid on our debt are based on variable interest rates therefore the exposure of our net income to a change in interest rates is partially mitigated as an increase in rates would increase both interest income and interest expense and a reduction in rates would decrease both interest income and interest expense under our current policies we may selectively use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements to manage all or a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes we have entered into interest rate swaps that reduce a portion of our exposure to market interest rate risk on certain of our variablerate debt as discussed in note 7 —longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

based on balances outstanding under variablerate debt agreements and invested cash balances at december 31 2019  a hypothetical increase of 50 basis points in applicable interest rates as of december 31 2019 would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 74 million and increase our annual interest income by approximately 28 million

 item 9a  controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2019  management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2019  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the internal control — integrated framework 2013  

on september 18 2019  we consummated our merger with total system services inc tsys as permitted by the sec rules and regulations managements assessment did not include the internal control of the acquired operations of tsys which are included in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2019 and for the period from the acquisition date through december 31 2019  in accordance with our integration efforts we plan to incorporate the acquired operations of tsys into our internal control over financial reporting program within the time period provided by applicable sec rules and regulations the assets excluding goodwill of the acquired operations of tsys constituted approximately 32 of our total consolidated assets as of december 31 2019  operating results of the acquired operations of tsys comprised approximately 25 of our total consolidated revenues and approximately of 10 our consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31 2019  

based on the results of its evaluation which excluded assessments of the internal control of the acquired operations of tsys management believes that as of december 31 2019  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk

we process funds settlement under two models a sponsorship model and a direct membership model under the sponsorship model we are designated as an iso by mastercard and visa to be designated as a certified processor member clearing financial institutions members sponsor us and require our adherence to the standards of the networks in certain markets we have sponsorship or depository and clearing agreements with financial institution sponsors these agreements allow us to route transactions under the members control and identification numbers to clear card transactions through mastercard and visa in this model the standards of the card networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds and instead require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant has been funded 

under the direct membership model we are direct members in various payment networks allowing us to process and fund transactions without thirdparty sponsorship in this model we route and clear transactions directly through the card brand’s network and are not restricted from performing funds settlement otherwise we process these transactions similarly to how we process transactions in the sponsorship model we are required to adhere to the standards of the various networks in which we are direct members we maintain relationships with financial institutions which may also serve as our member sponsors for other card brands or in other markets to assist with funds settlement

a typical payment transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location where the card information is captured by a pos terminal card reader or mobile device card reader which may be sold or leased to the merchant and serviced by us alternatively card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device or ecommerce portal by one of a number of services that we offer directly or through a valueadded reseller the card reader electronically records sales draft information such as the card identification number transaction date and transaction amount 

after the card and transaction information is captured the pos device automatically connects to our network through the internet or other communication channel in order to receive authorization of the transaction for a credit card transaction authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction amount will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits in a debit card transaction we obtain authorization for the transaction from the card issuer through the payment network verifying that the cardholder has access to sufficient funds for the transaction amount 

as an illustration shown below on a 10000 card transaction the card issuer may fund the member our sponsor indirectly through the card network 9850 after retaining approximately 150 referred to as an interchange fee the card issuer seeks reimbursement of 10000 from the cardholder in the cardholders monthly credit card statement the member would in turn pay the merchant 10000 the net settlement after this transaction would require us to advance the member 150 after the end of the month we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction amount or merchant discount to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our fee from the transaction if our discount rate for the merchant in the above example was 200 we would bill the merchant 200 after the end of the month for the transaction reimburse ourselves for 150 in interchange fees and retain 050 as our fees for the transaction under some arrangements we remit the net amount of 9800 to the merchant rather than funding the full 10000 and subsequently billing the merchant at the end of the month discount rates vary based on negotiations with merchants and the economic characteristics of transactions interchange rates also vary based on the economic characteristics of individual transactions accordingly our fee per transaction varies across our merchant base and is subject to change based on changes in discount rates and interchange rates our profit on the transaction reflects the fee received less payment network fees and operating expenses including systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or iso payment network fees are charged by the card brands in part based on the value of transactions processed through their networks

industry overview 

the payment technology services industry provides merchants with credit debit gift and loyalty card and other payment processing services along with related information services the industry continues to grow as a result of wider merchant acceptance increased consumer use of credit and debit cards and advances in payment processing and telecommunications technology the proliferation of credit and debit cards has made the acceptance of cardbased payments a virtual necessity for many businesses regardless of size in order to remain competitive this increased use of cards and the availability of more sophisticated technology services to all market segments has resulted in a highly competitive and specialized industry 

competition 

we are a leading provider of payments technology and software solutions in north america where we compete primarily with bank of america merchant services llc a joint venture between first data corporation and bank of america corporation chase paymentech solutions llc elavon inc a subsidiary of us bancorp first data corporation total system services inc wells fargo bank na and worldpay inc while these are our primary competitors some of our vertically focused business in the united states compete with other organizations 

in europe and the asiapacific region financial institutions remain the primary providers of payment technology services to merchants although the outsourcing of these services to thirdparty service providers is becoming more prevalent payment services have become increasingly complex requiring significant capital commitments to develop maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at competitive prices 

competitors in europe include ayden nv barclays bank plc spanish banking institutions and worldpay inc financial institutions that offer merchant acquiring services are our primary competitors in asiapacific 

emerging trends 

the payments technology industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result certain large payment technology companies including us have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures we expect to continue to expand into new markets internationally and increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing further acquisitions and joint ventures 

we believe that the number of electronic payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies as a result we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies however we do not expect our aggregate capital spending to increase materially from our current level of spending as a result of this 

we also believe new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paperbased transactions we expect industries such as education government and healthcare as well as recurring payments and businesstobusiness payments to continue to see transactions migrate to electronicbased solutions we anticipate that the continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future 

strategy 

we seek to leverage the adoption of and transition to card electronic and digitalbased payments by expanding share in our existing markets through our distribution channels and service innovation as well as through acquisitions to improve our offerings and scale we also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions alliances and joint ventures around the world we intend to continue to invest in and leverage our technology infrastructure and our people to increase our penetration in existing markets 

the key tenets of our strategy include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

 

   

 

 

 

safeguarding our business 

in order to provide our services we obtain and store sensitive business information and personal information about our merchants merchants’ customers merchants’ employees vendors partners and other parties which may include credit and debit card numbers bank account numbers social security numbers drivers license numbers names and addresses and other types of personal information or sensitive business information some of this information is also processed and stored by our thirdparty service providers and other agents which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties as well as merchants and isos we have responsibility to the card networks their member financial institutions and in some instances our merchants isos andor individuals for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties or merchants as applicable to protect this information 

we are subject to cyber security and information theft risks in our operations which we seek to manage through a cyber and information security programs training and insurance coverage to strengthen our security and cyber defenses we continue to deploy multiple methods at different layers to defend our systems against misuse intrusions and cyberattacks and to protect the data we collect further we work with information security and forensics firms and employ advanced technologies to help prevent investigate and address issues relating to processing system security and availability we also collaborate with industry third parties regulators and law enforcement when appropriate to resolve security incidents and assist in efforts to prevent unauthorized access to our processing systems 

intellectual property 

our intellectual property is an important part of our strategy to be a leading provider of payment technology and software solutions we use a combination of internal policies intellectual property laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies and brands in addition to protect our various brands we seek and maintain registration of us and international trademarks service marks and domain names that align with our brand strategy we also enforce our trademarks against potential sources of confusion that could harm our brand and ability to compete 

employees and labor 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 11000  employees many of whom are highly skilled in technical areas specific to payment technology and software solutions 

regulation 

various aspects of our business are subject to regulation and supervision under federal state and local laws in the united states such as the california consumer privacy act the ccpa and foreign laws regulations and rules including directive 200764ec in the european union the payment services directive as well as local escheat laws and privacy and information security regulations in addition we are subject to rules promulgated by the various payment networks including american express discover interac mastercard upi and visa in addition because we provide data processing services to banks and other financial institutions we are subject to examination by the federal financial institutions examination council the ffiec set forth below is a brief summary of some of the significant laws and regulations that apply to us these descriptions are not exhaustive and these laws regulations and rules frequently change and are increasing in number 

doddfrank act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act which was signed into law in the united states in 2010 resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry the doddfrank act directed the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal reserve board to regulate the debit interchange transaction fees that a card issuer or payment card network receives or charges for an electronic debit transaction pursuant to the socalled durbin amendment to the doddfrank act these fees must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing clearing and settling the transaction pursuant to regulations promulgated by the federal reserve board debit interchange rates for card issuers with assets of 10 billion or more are capped at 021 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuers fraud losses plus for qualifying issuers an additional 001 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs the cap on interchange fees has not had a material direct effect on our results of operations 

in addition the doddfrank act limits the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions because it allows merchants to i set minimum dollar amounts not to exceed 10 for the acceptance of a credit card and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and ii provide discounts or incentives to encourage consumers to pay with cash checks debit cards or credit cards 

the rules also contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions that require a card issuer to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements and restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements the prohibition on network exclusivity has not significantly affected our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our customers nor do we expect it to in the future 

the doddfrank act also created the financial stability oversight council the fsoc which was established to among other things identify risks to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc has the authority to require supervision and regulation of nonbank financial companies that the fsoc determines pose a systemic risk to the us financial system accordingly we may be subject to additional systemic riskrelated oversight 

payment network rules 

we are subject to the rules of american express discover interac mastercard upi and visa and other payment networks in order to provide our services several of our subsidiaries are either registered as service providers for member institutions with mastercard visa and other networks or are direct members of mastercard visa and other networks accordingly we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions 

banking laws and regulations 

the ffiec is an interagency body comprised of federal bank and credit union regulators such as the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation the national credit union administration the office of the comptroller of the currency and the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb the ffiec examines large data processors in order to identify and mitigate risks associated with systemically significant service providers including specifically the risks they may pose to the banking industry in addition we are subject to the payment services directive which was implemented in most european union member states through national legislation as a result of this legislation we are subject to regulation and oversight in certain european union member nations including the requirement that we maintain specified regulatory capital however these regulatory capital requirements are generally insignificant to our total assets and total equity and have no material effect on our liquidity 

privacy information security and healthcare technology laws 

we provide services that may be subject to various state federal and foreign privacy laws and regulations and as a result of our recent acquisition of advancedmd certain healthcare technology laws including the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 as amended “hipaa” and the health information technology for economic and clinical health act these laws and regulations also include the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 which applies to a broad range of financial institutions and to companies that provide services to financial institutions in the united states including our gaming business and the ccpa which requires companies that process personal information of california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection and use and will grant consumers specific access rights to their data outside the united states these laws include without limitation the eu general data protection regulation canada’s personal 

information protection and electronic documents act hong kong’s personal data privacy ordinance cap 486 the taiwan personal data protection law the philippines’ data privacy act of 2012 and australia’s federal privacy act of 1988 see item 1a risk factors   any new implementation of or changes made to laws regulations card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable effect on our financial results and our cash flows    

antimoney laundering and counter terrorist requirements 

in many countries we are legally or contractually required to comply with antimoney laundering laws and regulations such as in the united states the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 collectively the bsa and the bsa implementing regulations of the financial crimes enforcement network fincen a bureau of the us department of the treasury a variety of similar antimoney laundering requirements apply in other countries in some countries we are directly subject to these requirements in other countries we have contractually agreed to assist our sponsor banks with their obligation to comply with antimoney laundering requirements that apply to them these laws typically require organizations to 

 

 

 

 

regulations issued by the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us department of treasury place prohibitions and restrictions on all us citizens and entities including the company with respect to transactions by us persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on ofacs specially designated nationals list for example individuals and companies owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions as well as terrorists terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by ofac under programs that are not country specific similar requirements apply to transactions and dealings with persons and entities specified in lists maintained in other countries we have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments and that allow our customers to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries individuals or entities 

escheat laws 

we are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property state laws in the united states and in certain foreign countries that require us to transfer to certain government authorities the unclaimed property of others that we hold when that property has been unclaimed for a certain period of time moreover we are subject to audit by state and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to our escheatment practices 

foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to foreign laws and regulations that affect the payment technology services industry in each of the foreign countries in which we operate some of these countries such as the russian federation india and the united kingdom have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years in these countries there is a greater risk of new unforeseen changes that could result from among other things instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic conditions changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict or action by the european union or the united states canada or other governments that may restrict our ability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities such as sanctions by or against the russian federation 

debt collection and credit reporting laws 

portions of our business may be subject to the fair debt collection practices act the fair credit reporting act and similar state laws these debt collection laws are designed to eliminate abusive deceptive and unfair debt collection practices and may require licensing at the state level the fair credit reporting act regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also imposes disclosure requirements on entities that take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies

risks related to our business and operations 

our ability to protect our systems and data from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks could affect our reputation among our customers and cardholders adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial institution sponsorship and may expose us to penalties fines liabilities and legal claims 

in order to provide our services we process and store sensitive business information and personal information about our merchants merchants’ customers merchants’ employees isos vendors partners and other parties this information may include credit and debit card numbers bank account numbers social security numbers driver’s license numbers names and addresses and other types of personal information or sensitive business information some of this information is also processed and stored by our thirdparty service providers and other agents which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties as well as merchants and isos we have responsibility to the card networks their member financial institutions and in some instances our merchants isos andor individuals for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties or merchants as applicable to protect this information 

we are a regular target of malicious thirdparty attempts to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities andor penetrate or bypass our security measures in order to gain unauthorized access to our networks and systems or those of our associated third parties such access could lead to the compromise of sensitive business personal or confidential information as a result we follow a defenseindepth model for cybersecurity meaning we proactively seek to employ multiple methods at different layers to defend our systems against intrusion and attack and to protect the data we collect however we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats 

our computer systems andor our associated third parties’ computer systems could be subject to penetration and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect and continually evolve and become more sophisticated threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties including statesponsored organizations with significant financial and technological resources computer viruses and other malware can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities our defensive measures may not prevent downtime unauthorized access or use of sensitive data while we maintain first and thirdparty insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses companies we acquire may require postclosing implementation of additional cyber defense methods to align with our standards and as a result there may be a period of increased risk between the closing of an acquisition and the completion of such implementation further our thirdparty relationships are subject to our vendor management program and governed by written contracts however we do not control the actions of our associated third parties and any problems experienced by these third parties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in the services provided by such parties or cyberattacks and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to service our merchant customers or otherwise conduct our business 

we also could be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information in violation of contractual obligations or data privacy laws regulatory authorities around the world are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and use and the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe the asiapacific region and elsewhere is increasingly uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices or operations model which could result in potential liability for fines damages or a need to incur substantial costs to modify our operations in addition we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to use security and privacy that we impose on our associated third parties who have access to this data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the misuse of this data any misuse or compromise of personal information or failure to adequately enforce these contractual requirements could result in liability protracted and costly litigation and with respect to misuse of personal information of our merchants and consumers lost revenue and reputational harm in addition as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly 

rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs 

any type of security breach attack or misuse of data described above or otherwise whether experienced by us or an associated third party could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services or from making electronic payments generally increase our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the incident expose us to unanticipated or uninsured liability disrupt our operations including potential service interruptions distract our management increase our risk of litigation or regulatory scrutiny result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state federal and foreign laws or by the card networks and adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial institution sponsorship our removal from networks lists of payment card industry data security standard compliant service providers could mean that existing merchant customers sales partners or other third parties may cease using or referring our services also prospective merchant customers sales partners or other third parties may choose to terminate negotiations with us or delay or choose not to consider us for their processing needs in addition the card networks could refuse to allow us to process through their networks 

the payment technology services industry is highly competitive and some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do which may give them an advantage with respect to the pricing of services offered to customers and the ability to develop new technologies 

we operate in the payment technology services industry which is highly competitive in this industry our primary competitors include other independent payment processors as well as financial institutions isos and potentially card networks many of our competitors are companies that are larger than we are with greater financial and operational resources than we have our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a direct member for participation in the card networks as we do in certain jurisdictions and may be able to settle transactions more quickly for merchants than we can these financial institutions may also provide payment processing services to merchants at a loss in order to generate banking fees from the merchants it is also possible that larger financial institutions could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide these attributes may provide them with a competitive advantage in the market 

furthermore we are facing increasing competition from nontraditional competitors including new entrant technology companies who offer certain innovations in payment methods some of these competitors utilize proprietary software and service solutions some of these nontraditional competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers in addition some nontraditional competitors such as private companies or startup companies may be less risk averse than we are and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to market demands if these nontraditional competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these competitors may compete in ways that minimize or remove the role of traditional card networks processors andor pointofsale software in the electronic payments process 

in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings we must continually and quickly update our services a process that could result in higher costs and the loss of revenues earnings and customers if the new services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 

the payment technology services industry in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in a number of projects including the development of a new authorization platform mobile payment applications ecommerce services and other new offerings emerging in the payment technology services industry these projects carry the risks associated with any development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance problems in the payment technology services markets these risks are even more acute any delay in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate our services could render our services less desirable to customers or possibly even obsolete furthermore as the market for alternative payment processing services evolves it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new services targeted at this market 

in addition the services we deliver to the payment technology services markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions all at very high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses as a result of these factors our development efforts could result in higher costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenues and earnings if promised new services are not delivered 

timely to our customers or do not perform as anticipated we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies 

our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa cards and mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registrations financial institution sponsorship and in some cases continued membership in certain card networks 

  

in order to provide our visa and mastercard transaction processing services we must be either a direct member or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of visa and mastercard respectively registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of each organization in certain jurisdictions if our sponsor financial institution in any market should stop providing sponsorship for us we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers and potential customers in that market which would negatively affect our revenues earnings and cash flows furthermore some agreements with our financial institution sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants our sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in connection with direct membership the rules and regulations of various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would limit our use of capital for other purposes 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement our business may be adversely affected 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services we must find other financial institutions to provide those services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers which could negatively affect our revenues earnings and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations or membership if we incur fines or penalties for which our merchants or isos are responsible that we cannot collect or pursue collection from them we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties 

we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions the rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issuers and some of those issuers are our competitors with respect to these processing services many banks directly or indirectly sell processing services to merchants in direct competition with us these banks could attempt by virtue of their influence on the networks to alter the networks rules or policies to the detriment of nonmembers including us in certain jurisdictions the termination of our registrations or our membership or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows if a merchant or an iso fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks we or the merchant or iso could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks if we cannot collect or pursue collection of such amounts from the applicable merchant or iso we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties resulting in lower earnings for us the termination of our registration or any changes in the visa or mastercard rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing visa and mastercard payment processing services which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale 

our systems or our thirdparty providers systems may fail which could interrupt our service cause us to lose business increase our costs and expose us to liability 

we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems software data centers and telecommunications networks as well as the systems and services of third parties a system outage or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows not only would we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss but we may also be liable to third parties our systems and operations or those of our thirdparty providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from among other things fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure terrorist acts war unauthorized entry human error and computer viruses or other defects 

defects in our systems or those of third parties errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions telecommunications failures or other difficulties including those related to system relocation could result in loss of revenue loss of customers loss of merchant and cardholder data harm to our business or reputation exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities negative publicity additional operating and development costs fines and other sanctions imposed by card networks andor diversion of technical and other resources 

we may experience software defects undetected errors and development delays which could damage customer relations decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability 

our services are based on software and computing systems that often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software services and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation and exposure to liability claims 

in addition we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased merchant referral partner or iso attrition could cause our financial results to decline 

we experience attrition in merchant credit and debit card processing volume resulting from several factors including business closures transfers of merchants accounts to our competitors unsuccessful contract renewal negotiations and account closures that we initiate for various reasons such as heightened credit risks or contract breaches by merchants if an iso partner switches to another transaction processor terminates our services internalizes payment processing functions that we perform merges with or is acquired by one of our competitors or shuts down or becomes insolvent we may no longer receive new merchant referrals from the iso and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the iso we cannot predict the level of attrition in the future and it could increase our referral partners are a significant source of new business higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our future growth depends in part on the continued expansion within markets in which we already operate the emergence of new markets and the continued availability of alliance relationships and strategic acquisition opportunities 

our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate the further expansion of these markets the emergence of other markets for payment technology and software solutions and our ability to penetrate these markets as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion we look for acquisition opportunities investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration technological capabilities product offerings and distribution capabilities we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition investment and alliance candidates in the future and if we do they may not provide us with the value and benefits we anticipate 

our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets if we fail to expand into new and existing markets for payment technology and software solutions we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 

  

there may be a decline in the use of cards and other electronic payments as a payment mechanism for consumers or adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general 

if consumers do not continue to use credit or debit cards or other electronic payment methods as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash checks credit cards and debit cards which is adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows consumer credit risk may make it more difficult or expensive for consumers to gain access to credit facilities such as credit cards regulatory changes may result in financial institutions seeking to charge their customers additional fees for use of credit or debit cards such fees may result in decreased use of credit or debit cards by cardholders in each case our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected we believe future growth in the use of credit and debit cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to use electronic payment methods that we process including credit and debit cards 

we incur chargeback losses when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse us for chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder if we are unable to collect such amounts from the merchants account or reserve account if applicable or if the merchant refuses or is unable due to closure bankruptcy or other reasons to reimburse us for a chargeback we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder the risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment we may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have policies to manage merchantrelated credit risk and often mitigate such risk by requiring collateral and monitoring transaction activity notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

fraud by merchants or others could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit or debit card card number or other credentials to record a false sales or credit transaction processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback losses or cause us to incur other liabilities it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future increases in chargebacks or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to economic and political risk the business cycles and credit risk of our customers and the overall level of consumer business and government spending which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global payment technology services industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer business and government spending we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence consumer spending consumer discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions made using electronic payments a reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenues and profits if our merchants make fewer sales to consumers using electronic payments or consumers using electronic payments spend less per transaction we will have fewer transactions to process or lower transaction amounts each of which would contribute to lower revenues 

a downturn in the economy could force retailers to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines furthermore credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and be more selective with respect to whom they issue credit cards we also have a certain amount of fixed and other costs including rent debt service and salaries which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy changes in economic conditions could also adversely affect our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition a recessionary economic environment could affect our merchants through a higher rate of bankruptcy filings resulting in lower revenues and earnings for us our associated third parties are also liable for any fines or penalties that may be assessed by any card networks in the event that we are not able to collect such amounts from our merchants or the associated third parties due to fraud breach of contract insolvency bankruptcy or any other reason we may be liable for any such charges 

reject losses arise from the fact that in most markets we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period this results in the buildup of a substantial receivable from our customers if a merchant has gone out of business during the billing period we may be unable to collect such fees which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increases in card network fees may result in the loss of customers andor a reduction in our earnings 

  

from timetotime the card networks including visa and mastercard increase the fees that they charge processors we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers but this strategy might result in the loss of customers to our competitors who may not pass along the increases thereby reducing our revenues and earnings if competitive practices prevent us from passing along the higher fees to our merchant customers in the future we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby increase our operating costs and reducing our earnings 

any new implementation of or changes made to laws regulations card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable effect on our financial results and our cash flows 

our business is affected by laws and regulations and examinations that affect us and our industry in the countries in which we operate regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years failure to comply with regulations or guidelines may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration the limitation suspension or termination of service and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties including fines or may cause customers or potential customers to be reluctant to do business with us any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition for example we are subject to the card network rules of visa mastercard and other card networks interac and various debit networks applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate and of the card networks the payment services directive in europe the code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry in canada issued by canadas department of finance the housing assistance tax act of 2008 in the united states which requires information returns to be made for each calendar year by merchant acquiring entities and a myriad of us federal and state consumer protection laws and state escheat regulations we are also subject to examination by the ffiec as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions additionally we manage a membership discount program that is billed to customers annually on a recurring basis change in regulation of this type of billing could negatively affect our revenue 

interchange fees which are retained by the card issuer in connection with transactions are subject to intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide for instance the doddfrank act which was signed into law in july 2010 significantly changed the us financial regulatory system changes affecting the payment processing industry include restricting amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing institutions can charge merchants and allowing merchants to set minimum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts for different payment methods these types of restrictions could negatively affect the number of debit transactions which would adversely affect our business the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws and the financial stability oversight council which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company such as us should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve on the ground that it is systemically important to the us financial system any such designation would result in increased regulatory burdens on our business which increases our risk profile and may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

all persons offering or providing financial services or products to consumers directly or indirectly can be subject to prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap under the doddfrank act the cfpb has enforcement authority to prevent an entity that offers or provides consumer financial services or products or a service provider from committing or engaging in udaap including the ability to engage in joint investigations with other agencies issue subpoenas and civil investigative demands conduct hearings and adjudication proceedings commence a civil action grant relief eg limit activities or functions rescission of contracts and refer matters for criminal proceedings more generally all persons engaged in commerce including but not limited to us and our merchant and financial institution customers are also subject to section 5 of the federal trade commission ftc act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap in addition there are other laws rules and or regulations including the telemarketing sales act that may directly impact the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us as the merchants payment processor to investigations fees fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the ftc the cfpb and the states’ attorneys general have the authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in udap or violate other laws rules or regulations and to the extent we are processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities 

in many countries we are legally or contractually required to comply with the antimoney laundering laws and regulations such as in the united states the bsa as amended by the usa patriot act and similar laws of other countries which require that customer identifying information be obtained and verified in some countries we are directly subject to these requirements in other countries we have contractually agreed to assist our sponsor financial institutions with their obligation to comply with 

antimoney laundering requirements that apply to them in addition we and our sponsor financial institutions are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by ofac which prohibit us persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons or entities similar requirements apply in other countries our failure to comply with any of these contractual requirements or laws could adversely affect our business financial credit results of operations and cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of foreign and domestic laws and their implementing regulations which establish requirements for the collection processing storage use and disclosure of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information outside the united states these laws include without limitation the eu general data protection regulation as a result of our acquisition of advancedmd we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry including but not limited to false or fraudulent claim laws hipaa and other health privacy regulations prescribing laws electronic health record laws claims and transmission laws and prompt pay laws under hipaa covered entities and business associates must establish administrative physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming adding a layer of complexity to business practices and innovation as with other regulatory schemes our failure to comply could result in public or private enforcement action and accompanying litigation costs losses fines and penalties 

portions of our business may be subject to the fair debt collection practices act the fair credit reporting act and similar state laws these debt collection laws are designed to eliminate abusive deceptive and unfair debt collection practices and may require licensing at the state level the fair credit reporting act regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also imposes disclosure requirements on entities that take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies if we fail to comply with any of these laws to the extent they are applicable to us we may be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

changes to legal rules and regulations or interpretation or enforcement thereof even if not directed at us may require significant efforts to change our systems and services and may require changes to how we price our services to customers adversely affecting our business even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness could damage our business or our reputation furthermore we are subject to tax laws in each jurisdiction where we conduct business changes in such laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive the value of tax losses and tax credit carry forwards recorded on our balance sheet and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows and we may not effectively hedge against these risks 

a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate and we may incur additional variablerate indebtedness in the future increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or dividends 

we are also subject to risks related to the changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar revenues and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in currency exchange rates volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results 

in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currencies into us dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates through the use of hedging arrangements to the extent that we hedge our interest rate or currency exchange rate exposures we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates or currency exchange rates were to change in our favor developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and currency exchange rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition a counterparty to the arrangement could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate these arrangements 

changes in the method for determining libor and the potential replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on libor furthermore we have entered into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the libor benchmark interest rate in july 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the united kingdom stated that they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of libor interest rates indices the fca has indicated they will support the libor indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate the alternative reference rates committee has proposed the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its recommended alternative to libor and the federal reserve bank of new york began publishing sofr rates in april 2018 sofr is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities 

we are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate including the possibility of sofr as the dominant replacement the market transition away from libor and towards sofr is expected to be gradual and complicated including the development of term and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between libor and sofr introduction of an alternative rate also may introduce additional basis risk for market participants as an alternative index is utilized along with libor there can be no guarantee that sofr will become widely used and that alternatives may or may not be developed with additional complications we are not able to predict whether libor will cease to be available after 2021 whether sofr will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of libor or what the impact of such a possible transition to sofr may be on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we conduct a portion of our business in various foreign countries where the risk of continued political economic and regulatory change that could affect our operating results is greater than in the united states 

we expect to continue to expand our operations in north america europe and the asiapacific region some of the countries in which we operate such as the russian federation india and the united kingdom have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years and the risk of new unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the united states our business growth financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic conditions inflation changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict or action by the european union or the united states canada or other governments that may restrict our ability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities such as sanctions by or against the russian federation a possible slowdown in global trade caused by increasing tariffs or other restrictions could decrease consumer or corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending in countries outside the united states which could adversely affect our foreign operations 

in addition maintenance of certain types of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in many countries changes in these regulations such as taxation or limitations on transfers of data between countries or the type of permission that must be obtained in conjunction with the use of such data could have a material adverse effect on our business growth financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit and on march 29 2017 notified the european union that it intended to exit as provided in article 50 of the treaty on european union in march 2018 the parties agreed to a transition period of 21 months  from march 29 2019 until the end of 2020  before the united kingdom leaves the european union completely assuming approval of the negotiated withdrawal agreement the terms of the withdrawal are subject to ongoing negotiation that has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union 

brexit has caused and may continue to cause economic uncertainty including volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations which may adversely affect the profitability of our uk operations in addition brexit could lead to increased regulatory complexities including without limitation regulation relating to data security privacy and taxation with a range of outcomes still possible the full effect of brexit is uncertain and depends on any agreements the united kingdom may make to retain access to european union markets consequently no assurance can be given about the effect of the outcome on our uk business and its financial conditions results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions if any could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 

the acquisition integration and conversion of businesses such as but not limited to the recent acquisitions of advancedmd and sicom and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve a number of risks core risks are in the area of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited diligence and integration and conversion managing the complex process of integrating the acquired companys people services information security and technology and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition in addition international acquisitions and alliances often involve additional or increased risks including for example managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures complying with foreign regulatory requirements fluctuations in currency exchange rates enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries difficulty entering new foreign markets due to among other things customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets and general economic and political conditions 

if the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly the following factors among others could reduce our revenues and earnings increase our operating costs and result in us not achieving projected synergies 

 

the costs and effects of pending and future litigation investigations or similar matters or adverse facts and developments related thereto could materially affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

we are from timetotime involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and any claims asserted against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome may harm our reputation furthermore there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims 

in our rapidly developing legal framework we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or may develop software or technology that competes with ours our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property rights we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights trade secrets and knowhow or to determine their scope validity or enforceability which is expensive and could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove to be successful the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete 

we may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our services and technology infringe upon another party’s proprietary rights third parties may have or may eventually be issued patents that would be infringed by our services or technology any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our services or technology we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright trademark or license usage rights any such claims and any resulting 

litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could limit our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and require us to design around a third party’s patent which may not be possible or to license alternative technology from another party which may be costly in addition litigation is often time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees 

new or revised tax regulations unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense 

changes in tax laws or their interpretations could result in changes to enacted tax rates and may require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the new or revised tax regulations and significant estimates in calculations as well as the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced future changes in enacted tax rates could negatively affect our results of operations 

the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 us tax act significantly changed the taxation of usbased multinational corporations the us treasury department the us internal revenue service and state tax authorities have issued and are expected to continue to issue guidance on how the provisions of the 2017 us tax act will be applied or otherwise administered the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections any of which could materially change certain effects of the legislation as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the 2017 us tax act and as we gather information and perform more analysis our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows we have recognized estimated liabilities on the balance sheet for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial amount no more than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we may become subject to additional us state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our customers in which case our earnings could be adversely affected 

  

we are or may be subject in various jurisdictions to certain taxes that are not derived based on earnings eg sales gross receipts property valueadded and other business taxes application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and the taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on certain of these topics if we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax cost through to our customers our earnings and cash flows would be negatively affected 

we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations of such laws which have been confirmed through either tax rulings or opinions obtained in various jurisdictions including those related to valueadded taxes in europe changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive and the amount of our cash flows and have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our organizational and capital structure 

if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow our business could be adversely affected 

  

all of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological social economic and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital to successfully compete and grow we must recruit develop and retain the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of intellectual capital needs in addition we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital however the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors we cannot assure that key personnel including executive officers will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect us and decrease our business flexibility 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness our level of debt and the covenants to which we have agreed in connection with this and other financing transactions could among other things i require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of the debt ii reduce funds available for strategic initiatives and opportunities working capital capital investment and other general corporate needs and iii limit our ability to incur certain kinds or amounts of additional indebtedness which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our business our industry and economic conditions 

the companys debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to return capital to our shareholders 

our credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability in certain circumstances to among other things 

 

our credit facility also contains customary financial covenants based on our leverage ratio and our interest coverage ratio 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of cross default provisions and in the case of the revolving credit facility described in note 8 —longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements permit the lenders to cease making loans to us upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our credit facility could accelerate the repayment of borrowings and we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness 

we may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs which may prevent us from growing our business 

we may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs including developing new products and technologies or to fund future acquisitions or operating needs if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock we may also decide to issue securities including debt securities that have rights preferences and privileges senior to our common stock we may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all if financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our future needs this may prevent us from increasing our market share capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a portion of these assets could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a result of our acquisitions a significant portion of our total assets are intangible assets including goodwill goodwill and intangible assets net of amortization together accounted for approximately 67  of our total assets as of december 31 2018  we expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired under current accounting rules any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to record an impairment charge which would negatively affect our earnings an impairment of a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may not be able or permitted to or we may decide not to pay dividends or repurchase shares at a level anticipated by our shareholders which could reduce shareholder returns 

  

the extent to which we pay dividends on our common stock and repurchase our common stock in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on among other factors our results of operations financial condition capital requirements compliance with debt covenants and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant our credit facility may prohibit 

us from i repurchasing an amount more than the greater of 350 million or 3 of our total assets of our common stock in any year and ii paying quarterly dividends in excess of 001 per share no assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends or repurchase any shares in the foreseeable future 

our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk 

we operate in a rapidly changing industry accordingly our risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective to identify monitor and manage our risks if our policies and procedures are not fully effective or if we are not always successful in identifying and mitigating all risks to which we are or may be exposed we may suffer uninsured liability harm to our reputation or be subject to litigation or regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

  

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including but not limited to preventing unauthorized access to our systems we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act furthermore this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we may complete 

in certain markets including without limitation china the republic of malta and spain our member sponsors perform payment processing operations and related support services pursuant to services agreements we expect that the member sponsors will continue to provide these services until such time as we may integrate these functions into our operations accordingly we rely on our member sponsors to provide financial data such as amounts billed to merchants to assist us with compiling our accounting records as such our internal control over financial reporting could be materially affected or is reasonably likely to be materially affected by the internal control and procedures of our member sponsors in these markets 

while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective internal control over financial reporting failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the markets perception of our business and on our stock price 

antitakeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of georgia law could delay or prevent a change in control that individual shareholders favor 

  

provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of applicable georgia law may discourage delay or prevent a merger or other change in control that individual shareholders may consider favorable the provisions of our articles and bylaws among other things

emerging trends 

for a further discussion of trends uncertainties and other factors that could affect our continuing operating results see the section entitled risk factors in item 1a in this annual report on form 10k 

the payments technology industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result certain large payment technology companies including us have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures we expect to continue to expand into new markets internationally and increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing further acquisitions and joint ventures 

we believe that the number of electronic payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies as a result we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies however we do not expect our aggregate capital spending to increase materially from our current level of spending as a result of this 

we also believe new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paperbased transactions we expect industries such as education government and healthcare as well as recurring payments and businesstobusiness payments to continue to see transactions migrate to electronicbased solutions we anticipate that the continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future

at december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 12109 million  of this amount we consider 4345 million  to be available for general purposes of which approximately 18 million  is undistributed foreign earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states under the 2017 us tax act a companys foreign earnings accumulated under legacy tax laws are deemed repatriated and the 2017 us tax act generally eliminates us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries the available cash of 4345 million  does not include the following i settlementrelated cash balances ii funds held as collateral for merchant losses merchant reserves and iii funds held for customers settlementrelated cash balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant settlementrelated cash balances are not restricted however these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day merchant reserves serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement while this cash is not restricted in its use we believe that designating this cash to collateralize merchant reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks funds held for customers and the corresponding liability that we record in customer deposits include amounts collected prior to remittance on our customers behalf 

operating activities provided net cash of 11061 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  which was primarily attributable to net income of 4847 million  adjusted for noncash items including depreciation and amortization expense of 5228 million  partially offset by a decrease in operating assets and liabilities of 445 million  

fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities are affected primarily by timing of monthend and transaction volume especially changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities and by the effects of businesses we acquire that have different working capital requirements changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by 835 million  during the year ended december 31 2018  and decreased operating cash flows by 3617 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by 356 million  during the 2016 fiscal transition period and 2181 million  during the year ended may 31 2016 

operating activities provided net cash of 5124 million  5158 million  and 5929 million  respectively during the year ended december 31 2017 the transition period ended december 31 2016 and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities since 2016 during which time we completed the acquisitions of heartland active network advancedmd and sicom among others was primarily due to our revenue growth and corresponding increase in operating income the increase in operating cash flows from our growing business during this period was partially offset by investments made to integrate the acquired businesses during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 we incurred 561 million  946 million  916 million  and 513 million  respectively of acquisition and 

integration expenses primarily related to the acquired businesses in addition during that same period of time our interest expense has increased as a result of longterm debt we have issued primarily to help fund these acquisitions as well as increases in interest rates during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 cash paid for interest expense was 1775 million  1542 million  936 million  and 587 million  respectively based on the recent increase in our level of indebtedness to fund acquisitions together with recent increases in interest rates we expect our interest expense for the year ending december 31 2019 to increase compared to interest expense for the year ended december 31 2018 which could affect our cash flows and earnings 

we used net cash in investing activities of 14763 million  7360 million  867 million  and 21272 million  during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively cash used for investing activities represents primarily cash used to fund business acquisitions and capital expenditures 

during the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively we used cash of 12597 million  5627 million  339 million  and 20344 million  to complete acquisitions in addition to cash we used our common stock to fund a portion of the consideration for both the heartland and active network acquisitions see note 2 —acquisitions in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our business acquisitions and how we funded acquired businesses 

we made capital expenditures of 2133 million  1819 million  889 million  and 916 million  to purchase property and equipment including internaluse capitalized software development projects during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively these investments include software and hardware to support the development of new technologies continued consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms and infrastructure to support our growing business 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we sold our operating facility in jeffersonville indiana for 375 million  in addition during the 2016 fiscal transition period we exchanged all of our membership interest in visa europe to visa for upfront consideration including cash of approximately 377 million  

financing activities include borrowings and repayments made under our credit facility described in note 8 —longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as borrowings and repayments made under specialized lines of credit to fund daily settlement activities our borrowing arrangements are further described below under longterm debt and lines of credit financing activities also include cash flows associated with common stock repurchase programs and sharebased compensation programs as well as cash distributions made to noncontrolling interests and our shareholders cash flows from financing activities provided net cash of 2869 million  and 3523 million  during the years ended december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively during the 2016 fiscal transition period we used net cash in financing activities of 2788 million  during the year ended may 31 2016 cash flows from financing activities provided net cash of 19576 million  

proceeds from longterm debt were 28 billion  20 billion  13 billion  and 61 billion  for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively repayments of longterm debt were 23 billion  18 billion  14 billion  and 37 billion  for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively proceeds from longterm debt include borrowings that we make from timetotime under our revolving credit facility including those we have made to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for acquired businesses repayments of longterm debt include repayments that we make from timetotime under our revolving credit facility as well as scheduled principal repayments made under our term loans debt issuance costs reflect the amount of fees we paid to complete these borrowing activities during the year ended december 31 2018  we repatriated 4577 million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries and used the cash to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

because we often receive funding from the payment networks after we fund our merchants we have specialized lines of credit in various markets where we do business to fund settlement activity under our settlement lines of credit is affected primarily by timing of monthend and transaction volume during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 and the 2016 fiscal transition period we had net proceeds from settlement lines of credit of 708 million  2215 million  and 206 million  respectively during the year ended may 31 2016 we had net repayments of settlement lines of credit of 2060 million  

we make repurchases of our common stock mainly through open market repurchase plans and at times through accelerated share repurchase programs during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 we invested cash of 2082 million  348 million  1782 million  and 1360 million  respectively to repurchase shares of our common stock as of december 31 2018  we had 3878 million  of share repurchase authority remaining under a program authorized by the board of directors announced on february 6 2018  on february 5 2019  the board of directors increased its authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock to 750 million  inclusive of prior share repurchase programs authorized by the board and repurchases made thereunder 

we believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our longterm debt and lines of credit described below together with future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future

settlement lines of credit 

in various markets where we do business we have specialized lines of credit which are restricted for use in funding settlement the settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may in some cases facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies for certain of our lines of credit the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender accordingly the amount of the outstanding line of credit may exceed the stated credit limit as of december 31 2018  and 2017  a total of 706 million  and 593 million  respectively of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we had 7005 million  and 6352 million  outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity of 7103 million  as of december 31 2018  to fund settlement the weightedaverage interest rate on these borrowings was 297  and 197  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively

see note 8 —longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our borrowing arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition revenues results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources other than the guarantee services described in note 1 —basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

binica agreements 

  

we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks these agreements allow us to use the banks identification numbers referred to as bank identification number bin for visa transactions and interbank card association ica number for mastercard transactions to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard certain of such agreements contain financial covenants and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2018  

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2018  



1 interest on longterm debt is based on rates effective and amounts borrowed as of december 31 2018  the estimated effect of interest rate swaps is included in interest on longterm debt since the contractual rates for our longterm debt and settlements on our interest rate swaps are variable actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided 

2 operating lease obligations include approximately 70 million  for operating lease agreements not commenced at december 31 2018 

3 includes estimate of future payments for noncancelable contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts 

the table above excludes other obligations that we may have such as employee benefit obligations and other noncurrent liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet because the timing of the related payments is not determinable or because there is no contractual obligation associated with the underlying obligations 

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management and as a result actual future developments may be different from those expected at the time that we make these critical judgments we have discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions therefore the following descriptions of our critical accounting policies are forwardlooking statements and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forwardlooking statements you should read the following in conjunction with note 1 —basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in item 1a  risk factors of this annual report on form 10k 

goodwill 

we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of october 1 we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative assessment for impairment is necessary the option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit 

factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of our reporting units events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entityspecific events if we elect to 

bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount a quantitative test would be required 

we have seven  reporting units north america payments integrated solutions and vertical markets united kingdom asiapacific central and eastern europe russia and spain as of october 1 2018  we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for each of our reporting units we determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of each reporting unit was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts we believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount 

intangible and longlived assets 

other intangible assets include customerrelated intangible assets such as customer lists and merchant contracts contractbased intangible assets such as noncompete agreements referral agreements and processing rights acquired technologies and trademarks and trade names associated with business combinations these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives the useful lives for customerrelated intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows which include estimates for the revenues expenses and customer attrition associated with the assets the useful lives of contractbased intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements the useful lives of amortizable trademarks and trade names are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks and trade names in the applicable markets we use the straightline method of amortization for our amortizable acquired technologies trademarks and trade names and contractbased intangibles 

amortization for most of our customerrelated intangible assets is calculated using an accelerated method in determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset we multiply that percentage by the initial carrying amount of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates we adjust the amortization schedule prospectively these cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business we believe that our accelerated method better approximates the expected distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships we did not make any significant adjustments to the amortization schedules of our intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2018  

we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable when factors indicate that these longlived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such longlived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recorded measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may warrant revision 

capitalization of internaluse software 

we develop software that is used in providing services to customers capitalization of internaluse software primarily associated with operating platforms occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage management authorizes the project management commits to funding the project it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives the evaluation of alternatives the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred currently unforeseen circumstances in software development such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs the carrying amount of internaluse software including workinprogress at december 31 2018  was 4046 million  costs capitalized during the year ended december 31 2018  the year ended december 31 2017  the 2016  fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016  totaled 979 million  793 million  377 million  and 365 million  respectively internaluse software is amortized over its estimated useful life which is typically 2  to 10  years in a manner that best reflects the pattern of economic use of the assets 

income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using managements judgments estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

accounting standards codification asc topic 740 income taxes asc 740 requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment to address the application of gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 us tax act which was enacted on december 22 2017  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 which in march 2018 was codified by the fasb in asc 740 sab 118 provides guidance for registrants regarding the application of asc topic 740 in the reporting period that includes december 22 2017  including reporting provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 us tax act for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined in addition sab 118 requires provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts identified in the measurement period as defined to be included as an adjustment to tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the period the amounts are determined 

as a result of the enactment of the 2017 us tax act our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017 included a net benefit of 1587 million  reflecting provisional amounts for specific income tax effects as a result of the enactment of the 2017 us tax act for which our accounting was incomplete but could be reasonably estimated as of december 31 2017 during the year ended december 31 2018  we continued to analyze our foreign tax pools and resulting foreign tax credits and reduced the estimated transition tax liability which resulted in an income tax benefit of 233 million  as of december 31 2018 we have completed our accounting for the transition effects of the 2017 us tax act 

we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable however we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized when facts and circumstances change including an effective settlement of an issue or statute of limitations expiration the effect is recognized in the period of change the unrecognized tax benefits that exist at december 31 2018  would affect our provision for income taxes in the future if recognized judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized to the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made 

effect of new accounting pronouncements  recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted   

as more fully described in note 1 —basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2019 we will adopt a new lease accounting standard that requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases the application of the new lease accounting standard will also require several new disclosures we have made substantial progress in the execution of our implementation plan and we are substantially complete with our evaluation of the effect of asu 201602 on our consolidated financial statements we currently estimate that we will recognize lease liabilities on the balance sheet of approximately 275 million  at adoption for our operating leases we expect right of use assets will be approximately 235 million  reflecting adjustments for the net amount of leaserelated items previously recognized on the balance sheet we do not expect adoption to have a material effect on any line items in our consolidated statement of income or on our cash flows from operating activities investing activities or financing activities included in our consolidated statement of cash flows 

refer to note 1 —basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on the new lease accounting standard and other recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies consequently a portion of our revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not historically hedged our translation risk on foreign currency exposure but we may do so in the future for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 and the 2016 fiscal transition period currency rate fluctuations calculated by converting revenues and expenses for the current year in local currency using the prioryear period rates had an immaterial effect on our revenues and operating income for the year ended may 31 2016  currency rate fluctuations reduced our revenues by 1170 million  and our operating income by 436 million  as compared to the prioryear period calculated by converting revenues and expenses for the year ended may 31 2016  in local currency using prioryear period rates 

generally the functional currency of our various subsidiaries is their local currency we are exposed to currency fluctuations on transactions that are not denominated in the functional currency gains and losses on such transactions are included in determining net income for the period we seek to mitigate our foreign currency risk through timely settlement of transactions and cash flow matching when possible for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 our transaction gains and losses were insignificant 

additionally we are affected by currency fluctuations in our funds settlement process on merchant payment chargeback and card network settlement transactions that are not denominated in the currency of the underlying credit or debit card transaction gains and losses on these transactions are included in revenues for the period 

we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on our investments in foreign operations relative to our net investment in foreign operations the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the periodend rate of exchange the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and is included in shareholders equity transaction gains and losses on intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature are also recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our longterm debt and cash investments we invest our excess cash in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 

we have a credit facility for general corporate purposes as well as various lines of credit that we use to fund settlement in certain of our markets interest rates on these debt instruments and settlement lines of credit are based on market rates and fluctuate accordingly as of december 31 2018  the amount outstanding under these variablerate debt arrangements and settlement lines of credit was 59 billion  

the interest earned on our invested cash and the interest paid on our debt are based on variable interest rates therefore the exposure of our net income to a change in interest rates is partially mitigated as an increase in rates would increase both interest income and interest expense and a reduction in rates would decrease both interest income and interest expense under our current policies we may selectively use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements to manage all or a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes we have interest rate swaps that reduce a portion of our exposure to market interest rate risk on our liborbased debt as discussed in note 8 —longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

based on balances outstanding under variablerate debt agreements and invested cash balances at december 31 2018  a hypothetical increase of 50  basis points in applicable interest rates as of december 31 2018  would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 175 million  and increase our annual interest income by approximately 33 million

 item 9a  controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2018  management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2018  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in the  internal control —  integrated framework 2013  

we completed acquisitions of advancedmd and sicom in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 respectively as permitted by the sec rules and regulations managements assessment did not include the internal control of the acquired operations of these acquired businesses which are included in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2018  and for the periods from the acquisition dates through december 31 2018  in accordance with our integration efforts we plan to incorporate the operations of the acquired businesses into our internal control over financial reporting program within the time period provided by applicable sec rules and regulations the assets excluding goodwill of these acquired businesses constituted approximately 5  of our total consolidated assets as of december 31 2018  these acquired businesses comprised less than 2  of our total consolidated revenues and did not contribute to our consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31 2018  

based on the results of its evaluation which excluded assessments of the internal control of the acquired operations of advancedmd and sicom management believes that as of december 31 2018  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria

direct distribution 

our primary business model is to actively market and provide our payment services enterprise software solutions and other valueadded services directly to our customers through a variety of distribution channels we offer high touch services that provide our customers with reliable and secure solutions coupled with high quality and responsive support services through our direct sales force worldwide as well as bank partnerships we offer our payment technology services software and other valueadded solutions directly to customers in the markets we serve see business segments below for a description of our direct sales forces located around the world 

many of our payment solutions are technologyenabled in that they incorporate or are incorporated into innovative technologydriven solutions including enterprise software solutions designed to enable merchants to better manage their businesses our primary technologyenabled solutions include integrated and vertical markets ecommerce and omnichannel and gaming solutions each as described below 

integrated and vertical markets  our integrated and vertical market solutions provide advanced payments technology that is deeply integrated into business enterprise software solutions either owned by us or by our partners we grow our business when new merchants implement our enterprise software solutions and when new or existing merchants enable payments services through enterprise software solutions sold by us or by our partners we distribute our integrated payment solutions primarily through the following businesses 

 

 

 

 

 

ecommerce and omnichannel  we offer ecommerce and omnichannel solutions to our customers that seamlessly blend payment gateway services retail payment acceptance infrastructure and payment technology service capabilities to allow merchants to accept various payment methods through any channel across our geographical footprint we sell ecommerce and omnichannel solutions to customers of all sizes from small businesses accepting payments in a single country to enterprise and multinational businesses that have complex payment needs and operate retail and online businesses in multiple countries

wholesale distribution 

although our primary business model is to build high quality direct relationships with merchants we also provide our services through a wholesale distribution channel where we do not maintain the facetoface relationship with the merchant through our wholesale channel we provide payment services to merchants through independent sales organizations isos the isos act as thirdparty sales groups selling our payment technology services directly to enduser merchant customers 

credit and debit card transaction processing 

credit and debit card transaction processing includes the processing of the worlds major international card brands including american express discover card discover jcb mastercard unionpay international upi visa and nontraditional payment methods as well as certain domestic debit networks such as interac in canada credit and debit networks establish uniform regulations that govern much of the payment card industry during a typical payment transaction the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other but instead rely on payments technology companies such as global payments to facilitate transaction processing services including authorization electronic draft capture file transfers to facilitate funds settlement and certain exceptionbased back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 

we process funds settlement under two models a sponsorship model and a direct membership model under the sponsorship model we are designated as a merchant service provider by mastercard and as an iso by visa to be designated as a certified processor member clearing financial institutions member sponsor us and require our adherence to the standards of the networks in certain markets we have sponsorship or depository and clearing agreements with financial institution sponsors these agreements allow us to route transactions under the members control and identification numbers to clear card transactions through mastercard and visa in this model the standards of the card networks restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds and instead require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant has been funded 

under the direct membership model we are direct members in various payment networks allowing us to process and fund transactions without thirdparty sponsorship in this model we route and clear transactions directly through the card brand’s network and are not restricted from performing funds settlement otherwise we process these transactions similarly to how we process transactions in the sponsorship model we are required to adhere to the standards of the various networks in which we are direct members we maintain relationships with financial institutions which may also serve as our member sponsors for other card brands or in other markets to assist with funds settlement 

how a card transaction works 

a typical payment transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location where the card information is captured by a pos terminal card reader or mobile device card reader which may be sold or leased to the merchant and serviced by us alternatively card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device or ecommerce portal by one of a number of services that we offer directly or through a valueadded reseller the card reader electronically records sales draft information such as the card identification number transaction date and transaction amount 

after the card and transaction information is captured the pos device automatically connects to our network through the internet or other communication channel in order to receive authorization of the transaction for a credit card transaction authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction amount will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits in a debit card transaction we obtain authorization for the transaction from the card issuer through the payment network verifying that the cardholder has sufficient funds for the transaction amount 

as an illustration shown below on a 10000 card transaction the card issuer may fund the member our sponsor indirectly through the card network 9850 after retaining approximately 150 referred to as an interchange fee the card issuer seeks reimbursement of 10000 from the cardholder in the cardholders monthly credit card statement the member would in turn pay the merchant 10000 the net settlement after this transaction would require us to advance the member 150 after the end of the month we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction amount or merchant discount to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our fee from the transaction if our discount rate for the merchant in the above example was 200 we would bill the merchant 200 after the end of the month for the transaction reimburse ourselves for 150 in interchange fees and retain 050 as our fees for the transaction under some arrangements we remit the net amount of 9850 to the merchant rather than funding the full 10000 and subsequently billing the merchant at the end of the month discount rates vary based on negotiations with merchants and the economic characteristics of transactions interchange rates also vary based on the economic characteristics of individual transactions accordingly our fee per transaction varies across our merchant base and is subject to change based on changes in discount rates and interchange rates our profit on the transaction reflects the fee received less operating expenses including payment network fees systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or iso payment network fees are charged by the card brands based on the value of transactions processed through their networks

industry overview 

the payment technology services industry provides merchants with credit debit gift and loyalty card and other payment processing services along with related information services the industry continues to grow as a result of wider merchant acceptance increased consumer use of credit and debit cards and advances in payment processing and telecommunications technology the proliferation of credit and debit cards has made the acceptance of cardbased payments a virtual necessity for many businesses regardless of size in order to remain competitive this increased use of cards and the availability of more sophisticated technology services to all market segments has resulted in a highly competitive and specialized industry 

competition 

we are a leading provider of payments technology services in north america where we compete primarily with bank of america merchant services llc a joint venture between first data corporation and bank of america corporation chase paymentech solutions llc elavon inc a subsidiary of us bancorp first data corporation total system services inc wells fargo bank na and worldpay inc while these are our primary competitors some of our vertically focused business in the united states compete with other organizations 

in europe and the asiapacific region financial institutions remain the primary providers of payment services to merchants although the outsourcing of these services to thirdparty service providers is becoming more prevalent payment services have become increasingly complex requiring significant capital commitments to develop maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at competitive prices 

competitors in europe include barclays bank plc spanish banking institutions and worldpay inc financial institutions that offer merchant acquiring services are our primary competitors in asiapacific 

emerging trends 

the payments industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result certain large payment technology companies including us have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures we expect to continue to expand into new markets internationally or increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing further acquisitions and joint ventures 

we believe that the number of electronic payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies as a result we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies however we do not expect our aggregate capital spending to increase materially from our current level of spending as a result of this 

we also believe new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paperbased transactions we expect industries such as education government and healthcare as well as recurring payments and businesstobusiness payments to continue to see transactions migrate to electronicbased solutions we anticipate that the continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future 

strategy 

we seek to leverage the adoption of and transition to card electronic and digitalbased payments by expanding share in our existing markets through our distribution channels and service innovation as well as through acquisitions to improve our offerings and scale while also seeking to enter new markets through acquisitions alliances and joint ventures around the world we intend to continue to invest in and leverage our technology infrastructure and our people to increase our penetration in existing markets 

our key objectives include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

competitive strengths 

we believe that our competitive strengths include the following 

 

   

 

 

 

safeguarding our business 

privacy and security are central to our services we work with information security and forensics firms and employ advanced technologies to prevent investigate and address issues relating to processing system security and availability we also collaborate with industry third parties regulators and law enforcement to resolve security incidents and assist in efforts to prevent unauthorized access to our processing systems 

employees and labor 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 10000  employees many of whom are highly skilled in technical areas specific to payment technology services 

regulation 

various aspects of our business are subject to regulation and supervision under federal state and local laws in the united states as well as foreign laws regulations and rules in addition we are subject to rules promulgated by the various payment networks including american express discover interac mastercard upi and visa directive 200764ec in the european union the payment services directive as well as a variety of other regulations including escheat laws and applicable privacy and information security regulations in addition because we provide data processing services to banks and other financial institutions we are subject to examination by the federal financial institutions examination council the ffiec set forth below is a brief summary of some of the significant laws and regulations that apply to us these descriptions are not exhaustive and these laws regulations and rules frequently change 

doddfrank act 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act which was signed into law in the united states in 2010 resulted in significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the financial services industry the doddfrank act directed the board of governors of the federal reserve the federal reserve board to regulate the debit interchange transaction fees that a card issuer or payment card network receives or charges for an electronic debit transaction pursuant to the socalled durbin amendment to the doddfrank act these fees must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing clearing and settling the transaction pursuant to regulations promulgated by the federal reserve board debit interchange rates for card issuers with assets of 10 billion or more are capped at 021 per transaction and an ad valorem component of 5 basis points to reflect a portion of the issuers fraud losses plus for qualifying issuers an additional 001 per transaction in debit interchange for fraud prevention costs the cap on interchange fees has not had a material direct effect on our results of operations 

in addition the doddfrank act limits the ability of payment card networks to impose certain restrictions because it allows merchants to i set minimum dollar amounts not to exceed 10 for the acceptance of a credit card and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and ii provide discounts or incentives to encourage consumers to pay with cash checks debit cards or credit cards 

the rules also contain prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions that require a card issuer to enable at least two unaffiliated networks on each debit card prohibit card networks from entering into exclusivity arrangements and restrict the ability of issuers or networks to mandate transaction routing requirements the prohibition on network exclusivity has not significantly affected our ability to pass on network fees and other costs to our customers nor do we expect it to in the future 

the doddfrank act also created the financial stability oversight council the fsoc which was established to among other things identify risks to the stability of the us financial system the fsoc has the authority to require supervision and regulation of nonbank financial companies that the fsoc determines pose a systemic risk to the us financial system accordingly we may be subject to additional systemic riskrelated oversight 

payment network rules 

we are subject to the rules of american express discover interac mastercard upi and visa and other payment networks in order to provide our services several of our subsidiaries are either registered as service providers for member institutions with mastercard visa and other networks or are direct members of mastercard visa and other networks accordingly we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions 

banking laws and regulations 

the ffiec is an interagency body comprised of federal bank and credit union regulators such as the federal reserve board the federal deposit insurance corporation the national credit union administration the office of the comptroller of the currency and the bureau of consumer financial protection the ffiec examines large data processors in order to identify and mitigate risks associated with systemically significant service providers including specifically the risks they may pose to the banking industry in addition we are subject to the payment services directive which was implemented in most european union member states through national legislation as a result of this legislation we are subject to regulation and oversight in certain european union member nations including the requirement that we maintain specified regulatory capital however these regulatory capital requirements are generally insignificant to our total assets and total equity and have no material effect on our liquidity 

privacy and information security laws 

we provide services that may be subject to various state federal and foreign privacy laws and regulations these laws and regulations include the federal grammleachbliley act of 1999 which applies to a broad range of financial institutions and to companies that provide services to financial institutions in the united states including our gaming business we are also subject to a variety of foreign data protection and privacy laws including without limitation directive 9546ec as implemented in each member state of the european union and its successor the general data protection regulation which becomes effective in may 2018 among other things these foreign and domestic laws and their implementing regulations in certain cases restrict the collection processing storage use and disclosure of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information these laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and removal or elimination of personal information 

antimoney laundering and counter terrorist requirements 

in many countries we are legally or contractually required to comply with antimoney laundering laws and regulations such as in the united states the bank secrecy act as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 collectively the bsa and the bsa implementing regulations of the financial crimes enforcement network fincen a bureau of the us department of the treasury a variety of similar antimoney laundering requirements apply in other countries in some countries we are directly subject to these requirements in other countries we have contractually agreed to assist our sponsor banks with their obligation to comply with antimoney laundering requirements that apply to them these laws typically require organizations to 

 

 

 

 

regulations issued by the office of foreign assets control ofac of the us department of treasury place prohibitions and restrictions on all us citizens and entities including the company with respect to transactions by us persons with specified countries and individuals and entities identified on ofacs specially designated nationals list for example individuals and companies owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of countries subject to certain economic and trade sanctions as well as terrorists terrorist organizations and narcotics traffickers identified by ofac under programs that are not country specific similar requirements apply to transactions and dealings with persons and entities specified in lists maintained in other countries we have developed procedures and controls that are designed to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments and that allow our customers to protect against having direct business dealings with such prohibited countries individuals or entities 

escheat laws 

we are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property state laws in the united states and in certain foreign countries that require us to transfer to certain government authorities the unclaimed property of others that we hold when that property has 

been unclaimed for a certain period of time moreover we are subject to audit by state and foreign regulatory authorities with regard to our escheatment practices 

foreign laws and regulations 

we are subject to foreign laws and regulations that affect the electronic payments industry in each of the foreign countries in which we operate some of these countries such as the russian federation and the united kingdom have undergone significant political economic and social change in recent years in these countries there is a greater risk of new unforeseen changes that could result from among other things instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic conditions changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict or action by the european union or the united states canada or other governments that may restrict our ability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities such as sanctions by or against the russian federation 

debt collection and credit reporting laws 

portions of our business may be subject to the fair debt collection practices act the fair credit reporting act and similar state laws these debt collection laws are designed to eliminate abusive deceptive and unfair debt collection practices and may require licensing at the state level the fair credit reporting act regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also imposes disclosure requirements on entities that take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies we have procedures in place to comply with the requirements of these laws

risks related to our business and operations 

our ability to protect our systems and data from continually evolving cybersecurity risks or other technological risks could affect our reputation among our customers and cardholders adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial institution sponsorship and may expose us to penalties fines liabilities and legal claims 

in order to provide our services we process and store sensitive business information and personal information about our merchants merchants’ customers merchants’ employees isos vendors partners and other parties this information may include credit and debit card numbers bank account numbers social security numbers driver’s license numbers names and addresses and other types of personal information or sensitive business information some of this information is also processed and stored by our thirdparty service providers to whom we outsource certain functions and other agents which we refer to collectively as our associated third parties as well as merchants and isos we have responsibility to the card networks their member financial institutions and in some instances our merchants isos andor individuals for our failure or the failure of our associated third parties to protect this information 

we are a regular target of malicious thirdparty attempts to identify and exploit system vulnerabilities andor penetrate or bypass our security measures in order to gain unauthorized access to our networks and systems or those of our associated third parties such access could lead to the compromise of sensitive business personal or confidential information as a result we follow a defenseindepth model for cybersecurity meaning we proactively seek to employ multiple methods at different layers to defend our systems against intrusion and attack and to protect the data we collect however we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful and will be sufficient to counter all current and emerging technology threats 

our computer systems andor our associated third parties’ computer systems could be subject to penetration and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect threats to our systems and our associated third parties’ systems can derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure computer viruses and other malware can be distributed and could infiltrate our systems or those of our associated third parties in addition denial of service or other attacks could be launched against us for a variety of purposes including to interfere with our services or create a diversion for other malicious activities our defensive measures may not prevent downtime unauthorized access or use of sensitive data while we maintain first and thirdparty insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses further while we select our associated third parties carefully we do not control their actions any problems experienced by these third parties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in the services provided by such parties or cyberattacks and security breaches could adversely affect our ability to service our merchant customers or otherwise conduct our business 

we also could be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information in violation of contractual obligations or data privacy laws regulatory authorities around the world are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection and use and the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the united states europe the asiapacific region and elsewhere is increasingly uncertain it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices or operations model which could result in potential liability for fines damages or a need to incur substantial costs to modify our operations in addition we cannot provide assurance that the contractual requirements related to use security and privacy that we impose on our associated third parties who have access to this data will be followed or will be adequate to prevent the misuse of this data any misuse or compromise of personal information or failure to adequately enforce these contractual requirements could result in liability protracted and costly litigation and with respect to misuse of personal information of our merchants and consumers lost revenue and reputational harm 

any type of security breach attack or misuse of data described above or otherwise whether experienced by us or an associated third party could harm our reputation and deter existing and prospective customers from using our services or from making electronic payments generally increase our operating expenses in order to contain and remediate the incident expose us to unanticipated or uninsured liability disrupt our operations including potential service interruptions distract our management 

increase our risk of litigation or regulatory scrutiny result in the imposition of penalties and fines under state federal and foreign laws or by the card networks and adversely affect our continued card network registration or membership and financial institution sponsorship our removal from networks lists of payment card industry data security standard compliant service providers could mean that existing merchant customers sales partners or other third parties may cease using or referring our services also prospective merchant customers sales partners or other third parties may choose to terminate negotiations with us or delay or choose not to consider us for their processing needs in addition the card networks could refuse to allow us to process through their networks 

the payment processing industry is highly competitive and some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do which may give them an advantage with respect to the pricing of services offered to customers and the ability to develop new technologies 

we operate in the electronic payments market which is highly competitive in this market our primary competitors include other independent payment processors as well as financial institutions isos and potentially card networks many of our competitors are companies that are larger than we are with greater financial and operational resources than we have our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a direct member for participation in the card networks as we do in certain jurisdictions and may be able to settle transactions more quickly for merchants than we can these financial institutions may also provide payment processing services to merchants at a loss in order to generate banking fees from the merchants it is also possible that larger financial institutions could decide to perform inhouse some or all of the services that we currently provide or could provide these attributes may provide them with a competitive advantage in the market 

furthermore we are facing increasing competition from nontraditional competitors including new entrant technology companies who offer certain innovations in payment methods some of these competitors utilize proprietary software and service solutions some of these nontraditional competitors have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers in addition some nontraditional competitors such as private companies or startup companies may be less risk averse than we are and therefore may be able to respond more quickly to market demands if these nontraditional competitors gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows these competitors may compete in ways that minimize or remove the role of traditional card networks processors andor pointofsale software in the electronic payments process 

in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings we must continually and quickly update our services a process that could result in higher costs and the loss of revenues earnings and customers if the new services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 

the electronic payments markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change new product introductions evolving industry standards and changing customer needs in order to remain competitive we are continually involved in a number of projects including the development of a new authorization platform mobile payment applications ecommerce services and other new offerings emerging in the electronic payments industry these projects carry the risks associated with any development effort including cost overruns delays in delivery and performance problems in the electronic payments markets these risks are even more acute any delay in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate our services could render our services less desirable to customers or possibly even obsolete furthermore as the market for alternative payment processing services evolves it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new services targeted at this market 

in addition the services we deliver to the electronic payments markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions all at very high volumes and processing speeds any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses as a result of these factors our development efforts could result in higher costs that could reduce our earnings in addition to a loss of revenues and earnings if promised new services are not delivered timely to our customers or do not perform as anticipated we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors and potential competitors for the development of and access to new technologies 

our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa cards and mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard registrations financial institution sponsorship and in some cases continued membership in certain card networks 

  

in order to provide our visa and mastercard transaction processing services we must be either a direct member or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of visa and mastercard respectively registration as a merchant processor 

or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of each organization in certain jurisdictions if our sponsor financial institution in any market should stop providing sponsorship for us we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers and potential customers in that market which would negatively affect our revenues earnings and cash flows furthermore some agreements with our financial institution sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices including our solicitation application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants our sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in connection with direct membership the rules and regulations of various card associations and networks prescribe certain capital requirements any increase in the capital level required would limit our use of capital for other purposes 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement our business may be adversely affected 

we rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities if such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services we must find other financial institutions to provide those services if we are unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers which could negatively affect our revenues earnings and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks they could seek to fine us suspend us or terminate our registrations or membership if we incur fines or penalties for which our merchants or isos are responsible that we cannot collect or pursue collection from them we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties 

we are subject to card association and network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card networks for certain acts or omissions the rules of the card networks are set by their boards which may be influenced by card issuers and some of those issuers are our competitors with respect to these processing services many banks directly or indirectly sell processing services to merchants in direct competition with us these banks could attempt by virtue of their influence on the networks to alter the networks rules or policies to the detriment of nonmembers including us in certain jurisdictions the termination of our registrations or our membership or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor or any changes in card association or other network rules or standards including interpretation and implementation of the rules or standards that increase the cost of doing business or limit our ability to provide transaction processing services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows if a merchant or an iso fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks we or the merchant or iso could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks if we cannot collect or pursue collection of such amounts from the applicable merchant or iso we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties resulting in lower earnings for us the termination of our registration or any changes in the visa or mastercard rules that would impair our registration could require us to stop providing visa and mastercard payment processing services which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale 

our systems or our thirdparty providers systems may fail which could interrupt our service cause us to lose business increase our costs and expose us to liability 

we depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer systems software data centers and telecommunications networks as well as the systems and services of third parties a system outage or data loss could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows not only would we suffer damage to our reputation in the event of a system outage or data loss but we may also be liable to third parties our systems and operations or those of our thirdparty providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from among other things fire natural disaster power loss telecommunications failure terrorist acts war unauthorized entry human error and computer viruses or other defects defects in our systems or those of third parties errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions telecommunications failures or other difficulties including those related to system relocation could result in loss of revenue loss of customers loss of merchant and cardholder data harm to our business or reputation exposure to fraud losses or other liabilities negative publicity additional operating and development costs fines and other sanctions imposed by card networks andor diversion of technical and other resources 

we may experience software defects undetected errors and development delays which could damage customer relations decrease our potential profitability and expose us to liability 

our services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays and the underlying software may contain undetected errors viruses or defects defects in our software services and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts loss of credibility with current or potential customers harm to our reputation and exposure to liability claims 

in addition we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased merchant referral partner or iso attrition could cause our financial results to decline 

we experience attrition in merchant credit and debit card processing volume resulting from several factors including business closures transfers of merchants accounts to our competitors unsuccessful contract renewal negotiations and account closures that we initiate for various reasons such as heightened credit risks or contract breaches by merchants if an iso partner switches to another transaction processor terminates our services internalizes payment processing functions that we perform merges with or is acquired by one of our competitors or shuts down or becomes insolvent we may no longer receive new merchant referrals from the iso and we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the iso we cannot predict the level of attrition in the future and it could increase our referral partners are a significant source of new business higher than expected attrition could negatively affect our results which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our future growth depends in part on the continued expansion of markets in which we already operate the emergence of new markets and the continued availability of alliance relationships and strategic acquisition opportunities 

our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate the further expansion of these markets the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction payment processing and our ability to penetrate these markets as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion we look for acquisition opportunities investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration technological capabilities product offerings and distribution capabilities we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition investment and alliance candidates in the future and if we do they may not provide us with the value and benefits we anticipate 

our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets if we fail to expand into new and existing electronic payments markets we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 

  

there may be a decline in the use of cards and other electronic payments as a payment mechanism for consumers or adverse developments with respect to the card industry in general 

if consumers do not continue to use credit or debit cards or other electronic payment methods as a payment mechanism for their transactions or if there is a change in the mix of payments between cash checks credit cards and debit cards which is adverse to us it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows consumer credit risk may make it more difficult or expensive for consumers to gain access to credit facilities such as credit cards regulatory changes may result in financial institutions seeking to charge their customers additional fees for use of credit or debit cards such fees may result in decreased use of credit or debit cards by cardholders in each case our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected we believe future growth in the use of credit and debit cards and other electronic payments will be driven by the cost easeofuse and quality of services offered to consumers and businesses in order to consistently increase and maintain our profitability consumers and businesses must continue to use electronic payment methods that we process including credit and debit cards 

we incur chargeback losses when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse us for chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the event a dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant the transaction is normally charged back to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder if we are unable to collect 

such amounts from the merchants account or reserve account if applicable or if the merchant refuses or is unable due to closure bankruptcy or other reasons to reimburse us for a chargeback we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder the risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment we may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have policies to manage merchantrelated credit risk and often mitigate such risk by requiring collateral and monitoring transaction activity notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business 

fraud by merchants or others could have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit or debit card card number or other credentials to record a false sales or credit transaction processes an invalid card or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as counterfeiting and fraud failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback losses or cause us to incur other liabilities it is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future increases in chargebacks or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to economic and political risk the business cycles and credit risk of our customers and the overall level of consumer business and government spending which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global electronic payments industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer business and government spending we are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence consumer spending consumer discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits a sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or increases in interest rates may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions made using electronic payments a reduction in the amount of consumer spending could result in a decrease in our revenues and profits if our merchants make fewer sales to consumers using electronic payments or consumers using electronic payments spend less per transaction we will have fewer transactions to process or lower transaction amounts each of which would contribute to lower revenues 

a downturn in the economy could force retailers to close resulting in exposure to potential credit losses and future transaction declines furthermore credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and be more selective with respect to whom they issue credit cards we also have a certain amount of fixed and other costs including rent debt service and salaries which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy changes in economic conditions could also adversely affect our future revenues and profits and cause a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition a recessionary economic environment could affect our merchants through a higher rate of bankruptcy filings resulting in lower revenues and earnings for us our associated third parties are also liable for any fines or penalties that may be assessed by any card networks in the event that we are not able to collect such amounts from our merchants or the associated third parties due to fraud breach of contract insolvency bankruptcy or any other reason we may be liable for any such charges 

reject losses arise from the fact that in most markets we collect our fees from our merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period this results in the buildup of a substantial receivable from our customers if a merchant has gone out of business during the billing period we may be unable to collect such fees which could negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increases in card network fees may result in the loss of customers andor a reduction in our earnings 

  

from timetotime the card networks including visa and mastercard increase the fees that they charge processors we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers but this strategy might result in the loss of customers to our competitors who may not pass along the increases thereby reducing our revenues and earnings if competitive practices prevent us from passing along the higher fees to our merchant customers in the future we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby increase our operating costs and reducing our earnings 

any new implementation of or changes made to laws regulations card network rules or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable effect on our financial results and our cash flows 

our business is affected by laws and regulations and examinations that affect us and our industry in the countries in which we operate regulation and proposed regulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years failure to comply with regulations or guidelines may result in the suspension or revocation of a license or registration the limitation suspension or termination of service and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties including fines or may cause customers or potential customers to be reluctant to do business with us any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition for example we are subject to the card network rules of visa mastercard and other card networks interac and various debit networks applicable privacy and information security regulations in the regions where we operate and of the card networks the payment services directive in europe the code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry in canada issued by canadas department of finance the housing assistance tax act of 2008 in the united states which requires information returns to be made for each calendar year by merchant acquiring entities and a myriad of us federal and state consumer protection laws and state escheat regulations we are also subject to examination by the ffiec as a result of our provision of data processing services to financial institutions additionally we manage a membership discount program that is billed to customers annually on a recurring basis change in regulation of this type of billing could negatively affect our revenue 

interchange fees which are retained by the card issuer in connection with transactions are subject to intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide for instance the doddfrank act which was signed into law in july 2010 significantly changed the us financial regulatory system changes affecting the payment processing industry include restricting amounts of debit card fees that certain issuing institutions can charge merchants and allowing merchants to set minimum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards and to offer discounts for different payment methods these types of restrictions could negatively affect the number of debit transactions which would adversely affect our business the doddfrank act also created the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb which has assumed responsibility for enforcing federal consumer protection laws and the financial stability oversight council which has the authority to determine whether any nonbank financial company such as us should be supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve on the ground that it is systemically important to the us financial system any such designation would result in increased regulatory burdens on our business which increases our risk profile and may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

all persons offering or providing financial services or products to consumers directly or indirectly can be subject to prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices udaap under the doddfrank act the cfpb has enforcement authority to prevent an entity that offers or provides consumer financial services or products or a service provider from committing or engaging in udaap including the ability to engage in joint investigations with other agencies issue subpoenas and civil investigative demands conduct hearings and adjudication proceedings commence a civil action grant relief eg limit activities or functions rescission of contracts and refer matters for criminal proceedings more generally all persons engaged in commerce including but not limited to us and our merchant and financial institution customers are also subject to section 5 of the federal trade commission ftc act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices udap in addition there are other laws rules and or regulations including the telemarketing sales act that may directly impact the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us as the merchants payment processor to investigations fees fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the ftc the cfpb and the states’ attorneys general have the authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in udap or violate other laws rules or regulations and to the extent we are processing payments for a merchant that may be in violation of these laws rules or regulations we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities 

in many countries we are legally or contractually required to comply with the antimoney laundering laws and regulations such as in the united states the bsa as amended by the usa patriot act and similar laws of other countries which require that customer identifying information be obtained and verified in some countries we are directly subject to these requirements in other countries we have contractually agreed to assist our sponsor financial institutions with their obligation to comply with antimoney laundering requirements that apply to them in addition we and our sponsor financial institutions are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by the office of foreign assets control ofac which prohibit us persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons or entities similar requirements apply in other countries our failure to comply with any of these contractual requirements or laws could adversely affect our business financial credit results of operations and cash flows 

we are also subject to a variety of foreign and domestic laws and their implementing regulations including without limitation directive 9546ec as implemented in each member state of the european union and its successor the general data protection regulation which becomes effective in may 2018 that govern the collection processing storage use and disclosure of personal information require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent use and disclosure of protected information compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming adding a layer of complexity to business practices and innovation as with other regulatory schemes our failure to comply could result in public or private enforcement action and accompanying litigation costs losses fines and penalties 

on july 26 2011 the financial crimes enforcement network of the us department of the treasury or fincen issued a final rule regarding the applicability of the bank secrecy act’s regulations to prepaid access products and services this rulemaking clarifies the antimoney laundering obligations for entities engaged in the provision and sale of prepaid services such as prepaid cards this rule increases our regulatory risks and as with other regulatory requirements violations of the rule could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

portions of our business may be subject to the fair debt collection practices act the fair credit reporting act and similar state laws these debt collection laws are designed to eliminate abusive deceptive and unfair debt collection practices and may require licensing at the state level the fair credit reporting act regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and also imposes disclosure requirements on entities that take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies if we fail to comply with any of these laws to the extent they are applicable to us we may be subject to fines penalties and litigation 

changes to legal rules and regulations or interpretation or enforcement thereof even if not directed at us may require significant efforts to change our systems and services and may require changes to how we price our services to customers adversely affecting our business even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness could damage our business or our reputation furthermore we are subject to tax laws in each jurisdiction where we conduct business changes in such laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive the value of tax losses and tax credit carry forwards recorded on our balance sheet and have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows 

we are subject to risks associated with changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows and we may not effectively hedge against these risks 

a substantial portion of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate and we may incur additional variablerate indebtedness in the future increases in interest rates will reduce our operating cash flows and could hinder our ability to fund our operations capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or dividends we are also subject to risks related to the changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments in foreign operations and from revenues generated in currencies other than the us dollar revenues and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in currency exchange rates volatility in currency exchange rates has affected and may continue to affect our financial results 

in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currencies into us dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions the occurrence of any of these factors could decrease the value of revenues we receive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may seek to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or currency exchange rates through the use of hedging arrangements to the extent that we hedge our interest rate or currency exchange rate exposures we forgo the benefits we would otherwise experience if interest rates or currency exchange rates were to change in our favor developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates and currency exchange rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations in addition a counterparty to the arrangement could default on its obligation thereby exposing us to credit risk we may have to repay certain costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs if we terminate these arrangements finally our interest rate and currency exchange rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial losses if such rates move materially differently from our expectations 

we conduct a portion of our business in various foreign countries where the risk of continued political economic and regulatory change that could affect our operating results is greater than in the united states 

we expect to continue to expand our operations in north america europe and the asiapacific region some of the countries in which we operate such as the russian federation and the united kingdom have undergone significant political economic and 

social change in recent years and the risk of new unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the united states our business growth financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by instability or changes in a country’s or region’s economic conditions changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise increased difficulty of conducting business in a country or region due to actual or potential political or military conflict or action by the european union or the united states canada or other governments that may restrict our ability to transact business in a foreign country or with certain foreign individuals or entities such as sanctions by or against the russian federation 

in addition maintenance of certain types of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in many countries changes in these regulations such as taxation or limitations on transfers of data between countries or the type of permission that must be obtained in conjunction with the use of such data could have a material adverse effect on our business growth financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

on june 23 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union commonly referred to as brexit and on march 29 2017 notified the european union that it intended to exit as provided in article 50 of the treaty on european union the terms of the withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from the withdrawal notification date nevertheless the referendum has caused and may continue to cause volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting in a decline in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar in addition brexit could lead to increased regulatory complexities including without limitation regulation relating to data security privacy and taxation these changes may adversely affect our operations financial results and cash flows 

the integration and conversion of our acquired operations or other future acquisitions if any could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating these businesses as one are not achieved a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 

the acquisition integration and conversion of businesses such as the acquisition of active network involve a number of risks core risks are in the area of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited diligence and integration and conversion managing the complex process of integrating the acquired companys people services technology and other assets to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition in addition international acquisitions often involve additional or increased risks including for example managing geographically separated organizations systems and facilities integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures complying with foreign regulatory requirements fluctuations in currency exchange rates enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries difficulty entering new foreign markets due to among other things customer acceptance and business knowledge of those new markets and general economic and political conditions 

if the integration and conversion process does not proceed smoothly the following factors among others could reduce our revenues and earnings increase our operating costs and result in not achieving projected synergies 

 

the costs and effects of pending and future litigation investigations or similar matters or adverse facts and developments related thereto could materially affect our business financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

we are from timetotime involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and any claims asserted against us regardless of merit or eventual outcome may harm our reputation furthermore there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under 

various laws should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage they could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims 

in our rapidly developing legal framework we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or may develop software or technology that competes with ours our competitors may independently develop similar technology duplicate our services or design around our intellectual property rights we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights trade secrets and knowhow or to determine their scope validity or enforceability which is expensive and could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove to be successful the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete 

we may also be subject to costly litigation in the event our services and technology infringe upon another party’s proprietary rights third parties may have or may eventually be issued patents that would be infringed by our services or technology any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our services or technology we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright trademark or license usage rights any such claims and any resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages an adverse determination in any litigation of this type could limit our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims and require us to design around a third party’s patent which may not be possible or to license alternative technology from another party which may be costly in addition litigation is often time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees 

new or revised tax regulations unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies or changes to enacted tax rates could adversely affect our tax expense 

changes in tax laws or their interpretations could result in changes to enacted tax rates and may require complex computations to be performed that were not previously required significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the new or revised tax regulations and significant estimates in calculations as well as the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced future changes in enacted tax rates could negatively affect our results of operations 

as a result of the recently enacted us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 us tax act we remeasured our us deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are now expected to reverse due to the change in the us federal income tax rate we also recorded a transition tax payable on our previously deferred foreign earnings as a result of a new onetime tax established by the 2017 us tax act to address the application of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in situations in which a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting under the 2017 us tax act the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 that provides for the reporting of provisional amounts that may change during a measurement period and the deferral of recognition of any amounts in other instances until a reasonable estimate can be made the us treasury department the us internal revenue service and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 us tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation changes in the provisional amounts that we recorded could negatively affect our results of operations 

our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal state local and international taxing authorities an unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense thereby negatively affecting our results of operations and cash flows we have recognized estimated liabilities on the balance sheet for material known tax exposures relating to deductions transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks there can be no assurance that in all instances an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial amount no more than any related liability an unfavorable resolution therefore could negatively affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows in the current andor future periods 

we may become subject to additional us state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our customers in which case our earnings could be adversely affected 

  

we are or may be subject in various jurisdictions to certain taxes that are not derived based on earnings eg sales gross receipts property valueadded and other business taxes application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and the 

taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on certain of these topics if we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax cost through to our customers our earnings and cash flows would be negatively affected 

we have structured our business in accordance with existing tax laws and interpretations of such laws which have been confirmed through either tax rulings or opinions obtained in various jurisdictions including those related to valueadded taxes in europe changes in tax laws or their interpretations could decrease the value of revenues we receive and the amount of our cash flows and have a material adverse effect on our business 

risks related to our organizational and capital structure 

if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow our business could be adversely affected 

  

all of our businesses function at the intersection of rapidly changing technological social economic and regulatory developments that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital to successfully compete and grow we must recruit develop and retain the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of intellectual capital needs in addition we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital however the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors we cannot assure that key personnel including executive officers will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect us and decrease our business flexibility 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of december 31 2017  the outstanding balance under our credit facility was 47 billion  our increased level of debt and the covenants to which we have agreed in connection with this and other financing transactions could among other things i require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of the debt ii reduce funds available for strategic initiatives and opportunities working capital capital investment and other general corporate needs and iii limit our ability to incur certain kinds or amounts of additional indebtedness which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our business our industry and economic conditions 

the companys debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business and our ability to return capital to our shareholders 

our credit facility contains various covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability in certain circumstances to among other things 

 

our credit facility also contains customary financial covenants based on our leverage ratio and our fixed charge coverage ratio 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements including as a result of cross default provisions and in the case of the revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults under certain of our other indebtedness if we are unable to repay those amounts the lenders under our credit facility could accelerate the repayment of borrowings and we may not have sufficient assets to repay our credit facility as well as our other indebtedness 

we may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs which may prevent us from growing our business 

we may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs including developing new products and technologies or to fund future acquisitions or operating needs if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock we may also decide to issue securities including debt securities that have rights preferences and privileges senior to our common stock we may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all if financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms we may be unable to fund our future needs this may prevent us from increasing our market share capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry 

our balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets the impairment of a portion of these assets could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a result of our acquisitions a significant portion of our total assets are intangible assets including goodwill goodwill and intangible assets net of amortization together accounted for approximately 61  of the total assets on our balance sheet as of december 31 2017  we expect to engage in additional acquisitions which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets may be impaired under current accounting rules any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to record an impairment charge which would negatively affect our earnings an impairment of a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

we were incorporated in georgia as global payments inc in 2000 and spunoff from our former parent company in 2001  including our time as part of our former parent company we have been in the payment technology services business since 1967  since our spinoff we have grown our annual revenues from 353 million for the year ended may 31 2001 to 40 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  through internal expansion of existing operations and through acquisitions 

we provide payment technology and software solutions to customers globally our payment solutions are similar around the world in that we enable our customers to accept card electronic check and digitalbased payments our comprehensive offerings include terminal sales and deployment authorization processing settlement and funding processing customer support and helpdesk functions chargeback resolution industry compliance payment security services consolidated billing and statements and online reporting 

in addition we offer a wide array of enterprise software solutions that streamline business operations to customers in numerous vertical markets we also provide a variety of valueadded services including analytic and engagement tools payroll services and reporting that assist our customers with driving demand and operating their businesses more efficiently 

the majority of our revenues is generated by services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction depending on the card type or the vertical we also earn software licensing and subscription fees and other fees based on specific valueadded services that may be unrelated to the number or value of transactions 

our primary business model is to actively market and provide our payment services enterprise software solutions and other valueadded services directly to our customers through a variety of distribution channels we offer high touch services that provide our customers with reliable and secure solutions coupled with high quality and responsive support services through our direct sales force worldwide as well as bank partnerships we offer our payment technology services software and other valueadded solutions directly to customers in the markets we serve in addition we also provide certain of our services through a wholesale distribution channel where we do not maintain the facetoface relationship with the customer 

we seek to leverage the continued shift to electronic payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in north america europe and the asiapacific region and investing in and leveraging technology and people thereby maximizing shareholder value we also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions in europe the asiapacific region and the latin america region 

our business has not had pronounced seasonality in which more than 30 of our revenues occurred in one fiscal quarter however each geographic channel has somewhat higher and lower quarters given the nature of the merchant portfolio 

in 2016 we changed our fiscal year end from may 31 to december 31 as a result the period consisting of the seven months ended december 31 2016 is considered the 2016 fiscal transition period when our financial results for the year ended december 31 2017 and the 2016 fiscal transition period are compared to our financial results for the prioryear periods the results compare the twelvemonth period from january 1 2017 through december 31 2017 to the twelvemonth period from january 1 2016 through december 31 2016 and compare the sevenmonth period from june 1 2016 through december 31 2016 to the sevenmonth period from june 1 2015 through december 31 2015 the results for the twelve months ended december 31 2016 and the seven months ended december 31 2015 are unaudited 

executive overview 

we experienced strong business and financial performance around the world during the year ended december 31 2017  highlights related to our financial condition and results of operations as of december 31 2017  and for the year then ended include the following 

 

 

 

 

emerging trends 

the payments industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result certain large payment technology companies including us have expanded operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures we expect to continue to expand into new markets internationally or increase our scale and improve our competitiveness in existing markets by pursuing further acquisitions and joint ventures 

we believe that the number of electronic payment transactions will continue to grow and that an increasing percentage of these will be facilitated through emerging technologies as a result we expect an increasing portion of our future capital investment will be allocated to support the development of new and emerging technologies however we do not expect our aggregate capital spending to increase materially from our current level of spending as a result of this 

we also believe new markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paperbased transactions we expect industries such as education government and healthcare as well as payment types such as recurring payments and businesstobusiness payments to continue to see transactions migrate to electronicbased solutions we anticipate that the continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business and our revenue in the future 

acquisitions 

on september 1 2017 we acquired active network for total purchase consideration of 12 billion  consisting of approximately 600 million  in cash and 64 million  shares of our common stock active network delivers cloudbased enterprise software including payment technology solutions to event organizers in the communities and health and fitness vertical markets this acquisition aligns with our technologyenabled software driven strategy and adds an enterprise software business operating in two additional vertical markets that we believe offer attractive growth fundamentals 

on april 22 2016  we merged with heartland in a cashandstock transaction for total purchase consideration of 39 billion  the merger significantly expanded our small and mediumsized enterprise distribution merchant base and vertical reach in the united states 

on june 1 2015  we acquired certain assets of certegy check services inc a whollyowned subsidiary of fidelity national information services inc fis under the purchase arrangement we acquired substantially all of the assets of its gaming business related to licensed gaming operators the fis gaming business including relationships with gaming clients in approximately 260  locations as of the acquisition date for 2375 million

visa europe 

through certain of our subsidiaries in europe we were a member and shareholder of visa europe on june 21 2016  visa acquired all of the membership interests in visa europe including ours upon which we recorded a gain of 412 million  included in interest and other income in our consolidated statement of income for the seven months ended december 31 2016 we received upfront consideration comprised of € 335 million   377 million  equivalent at june 21 2016  in cash and series b and c convertible preferred shares whose initial conversion rate equates to visa common shares valued at 229 million  as of june 21 2016  however the preferred shares were assigned a value of zero  based on transfer restrictions visas ability to adjust the conversion rate and the estimation uncertainty associated with those factors the fair value of the preferred shares was determined using inputs classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to the absence of quoted market prices lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment the preferred shares will convert into visa common shares at periodic intervals over a 12 year period based on the outcome of potential litigation involving visa europe in the united kingdom and elsewhere in europe the conversion rate of the preferred shares could be adjusted down such that the number of visa common shares we ultimately receive could be as low as zero and approximately € 256 million   288 million  equivalent at june 21 2016  of the upfront cash consideration could be refundable on the third anniversary of the closing of the acquisition by visa we are contractually entitled to receive € 31 million   35 million  at june 21 2016  of deferred consideration plus compounded interest at a rate of 40  per annum 

results of operations

that have lowered our average outstanding borrowings and we have lowered the leveragebased margins we pay on interest rates through refinancing activities that we completed in october 2016 and may 2017 the savings in interest expense that we realized during the second half of 2017 due to these refinancing activities were partially offset by increases in london interbank offered rate libor during the intervening time frame and additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility to complete the acquisition of active network

interest and other expense increased by 768 million  for the seven months ended december 31 2016  compared to the prior 

year period primarily due to an increase in interest expense incurred resulting from an increase in the outstanding borrowings to fund the merger with heartland 

income tax provision 

our effective income tax rates were 206  and 253  respectively for the seven months ended december 31 2016  and 2015 the decrease in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to a higher percentage of income generated in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates primarily as a result of the mergerrelated expenses incurred in the united states

revenues 

for the year ended may 31 2016  revenues increased by 45  to 28982 million  compared to the prior year reflecting growth in each of our operating segments in spite of the unfavorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended may 31 2016  currency exchange rate fluctuations reduced our revenues by 1170 million  compared to the prior year calculated by converting revenues for the year ended may 31 2016  in local currencies using exchange rates for the year ended may 31 2015 

north america segment  for the year ended may 31 2016  revenues from our north america segment increased by 837 million  or 43  compared to the prior year to 20526 million  the increase was due to growth of 1244 million primarily in our us business partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations in canada of 407 million  the growth in revenues was primarily due to additional revenues from our merger with heartland and the acquisition of the fis gaming business as well as organic growth in our direct distribution business 

europe segment for the year ended may 31 2016  revenues from our europe segment increased by 159 million  or 26  compared to the prior year to 6319 million  the increase reflects revenue growth in local currencies generally due to an increase in the number of card transactions and volume growth in the united kingdom and spain partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations in europe of 626 million  

asiapacific segment for the year ended may 31 2016  revenues from our asiapacific segment increased by 248 million  or 131  compared to the prior year to 2136 million  the increase was primarily due to additional revenues of 296 million associated with recent acquisitions and organic growth partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations

operating income and operating margin 

  

north america segment operating income in our north america segment increased by 49  to 3076 million  for the year ended may 31 2016  compared to the prior year despite the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations of 205 million  the operating margin was 150  and 149  for the years ended may 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in operating income was primarily due to revenue growth in our us business partially offset by additional intangible asset amortization related to our acquisitions and the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations 

europe segment operating income in our europe segment increased by 20  to 2448 million  for the year ended may 31 2016  compared to the prior year despite the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations of 197 million  the operating margin was 387  and 390  for the years ended may 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the increase in operating income was primarily driven by revenue growth partially offset by the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations

corporate  corporate expenses increased to 1783 million  for the year ended may 31 2016  compared to the prior year due primarily to expenses of 513 million  associated with our merger with heartland 

other incomeexpense net 

interest and other expense increased by 249 million  for the year ended may 31 2016  compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in borrowings to fund our merger with heartland 

income taxes provision 

the provision for income taxes decreased by 373 million  for the year ended may 31 2016  compared to the prior year due to a decrease in income before income taxes largely due to expenses of 513 million  in the us associated with our merger with heartland and a lower effective income tax rate the decrease in our effective income tax rate from 259  to 196  during the year ended may 31 2016  was primarily due to a higher percentage of the earnings before income taxes derived from foreign operations with lower income tax rates primarily as a result of the mergerrelated expenses incurred in the united states as well as the elimination of certain net deferred tax liabilities associated with undistributed earnings from canada as a result of management’s plans to reinvest these earnings outside of the united states indefinitely 

liquidity and capital resources 

in the ordinary course of our business a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows cash flow from operations is used to make planned capital investments in our business to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives to pay dividends to pay down debt and to repurchase shares of our common stock accumulated cash balances are invested in highquality marketable shortterm instruments 

our capital plan objectives are to support our operational needs and strategic plan for longterm growth while maintaining a low cost of capital we use our credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions in addition specialized lines of credit are also used in certain of our markets to fund merchant settlement prior to receipt of funds from the card network we regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future either through the issuance of debt equity or otherwise 

at december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 13359 million  of this amount we consider 6584 million  to be available for general purposes which does not include the following i settlementrelated cash balances ii funds held as collateral for merchant losses merchant reserves and iii funds held for customers settlementrelated cash balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant settlementrelated cash balances are not restricted however these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day merchant reserves serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement while this cash is not restricted in its use we believe that designating this cash to collateralize merchant reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks funds held for customers and the corresponding liability that we record in customer deposits include amounts collected prior to remittance on our customers behalf 

our available cash balance at december 31 2017  included 5951 million  of cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states prior to the enactment of the 2017 us tax act these cash balances reflected our capital investments in these subsidiaries and the accumulation of cash flows generated by their operations net of cash flows used to service debt locally and fund acquisitions outside of the united states under the 2017 us tax act a companys foreign earnings accumulated under legacy tax laws are deemed repatriated and the 2017 us tax act generally eliminates us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries as a result our provisional position is that we now only consider approximately 60 million  of our undistributed foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states as of december 31 2017  in february 2018 we repatriated approximately 300 million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries and used the cash to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

operating activities provided net cash of 5124 million  during the year ended december 31 2017  which was primarily attributable to net income of 4941 million  adjusted for noncash items including depreciation and amortization expense of 4512 million  partially offset by a decrease in working capital of 3589 million  

fluctuations in working capital are affected primarily by timing of monthend and transaction volume especially changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows by 3617 million  and 788 million  during the years ended december 31 2017  and may 31 2015 respectively changes in settlement processing assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows by 356 million  during the 2016 fiscal transition period and 2181 million  during the year ended may 31 2016 

operating activities provided net cash of 5158 million  during the 2016 fiscal transition period and 5929 million  and 4299 million  respectively during the years ended may 31 2016 and 2015 the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities since 2015 during which time we completed the acquisitions of heartland and active network among others was primarily due to our revenue growth and corresponding increase in operating income the increase in operating cash flows from our growing business during this period was partially offset by investments made to integrate the acquired businesses during the year ended december 31 2017  the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 we incurred 946 million  916 million  and 513 million  respectively of acquisition and integration expenses primarily related to heartland in addition during that same period of time our interest expense increased substantially as a result of longterm debt we have issued primarily to help fund these acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2017  the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 cash paid for interest expense was 1542 million  936 million  and 587 million  respectively 

we used net cash in investing activities of 7360 million  867 million  and 21272 million  during the year ended december 31 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively cash used for investing activities represents primarily cash used to fund business acquisitions and capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2017 we used cash of 5995 million  to acquire active network and during the year ended may 31 2016 we used cash of 20 billion  to acquire heartland in addition to cash we have used our common stock to fund a portion of the consideration for both the heartland and active network acquisitions see note 2 —acquisitions in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our business acquisitions and how we funded those acquired businesses 

we made capital expenditures of 1819 million  889 million  and 916 million  to purchase property and equipment including internaluse capitalized software development projects during the year ended december 31 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively these investments include software and hardware to support the development of new technologies continued consolidation and enhancement of our operating platforms and infrastructure to support our growing business 

during the year ended december 31 2017 we sold our operating facility in jeffersonville indiana for 375 million  in addition during the 2016 fiscal transition period we exchanged all of our membership interest in visa europe to visa for upfront consideration including cash of approximately 377 million  

financing activities include borrowings and repayments made under our credit facility as well as borrowings and repayments made under specialized lines of credit to fund daily settlement activities financing activities also include cash flows associated with common stock repurchase programs and sharebased compensation programs as well as cash distributions made to noncontrolling interests and our shareholders cash flows from financing activities provided net cash of 3523 million  and 20 billion  during the years ended december 31 2017 and may 31 2016 respectively during the 2016 fiscal transition period we used net cash in financing activities of 2788 million  

proceeds from longterm debt were 20 billion  13 billion  and 61 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively repayments of longterm debt were 18 billion  14 billion  and 37 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 respectively proceeds from longterm debt include borrowings that we make from timetotime under our revolving credit facility proceeds from longterm debt also include incremental borrowings we have made to fund a portion of the consideration paid for acquired businesses and the effect of various refinancing activities to optimize our borrowing programs repayments of longterm debt include repayments that we make from timetotime under our revolving credit facility as well as scheduled principal repayments made under our term loans debt issuance costs reflect the amount we paid to complete these financing activities during the year ended 

may 31 2016 we added incremental borrowings to the credit facility then in place of 18 billion to fund in part the cash consideration and mergerrelated costs associated with heartland and to repay certain portions of heartlands indebtedness 

because we often receive funding from the payment networks after we fund our merchants we have specialized lines of credit in various markets where we do business to fund settlement activity under our settlement lines of credit is affected primarily by timing of monthend and transaction volume during the year ended december 31 2017 and the 2016 fiscal transition period we had net proceeds from settlement lines of credit of 2215 million  and 206 million  during the year ended may 31 2016 we had net repayments of settlement lines of credit of 2060 million  

we make repurchases of our common stock mainly through the use of open market purchases and at times through accelerated share repurchase programs during the year ended december 31 2017 the 2016 fiscal transition period and the year ended may 31 2016 we invested 348 million  1782 million  and 1360 million  respectively to repurchase shares of our common stock on february 6 2018  the board increased its authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock to 600 million  

we believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our longterm debt and lines of credit described below together with future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future 

longterm debt and lines of credit 

we are party to a credit facility agreement with bank of america na as administrative agent and a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and other agents as amended from time to time this credit facility was most recently amended on may 2 2017 the fourth amendment and as amended provides for i a 125 billion  revolving credit facility ii a 15 billion  term loan iii a 13 billion  term loan and iv a 12 billion  term loan facility the fourth amendment increased the total financing capacity under the credit facility on may 2 2017  from 49 billion  to 52 billion  although the outstanding debt under the credit facility did not change as we repaid certain outstanding amounts under the term a loan the term a2 loan and the revolving credit facility in connection with the fourth amendment substantially all of the assets of our domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the credit facility 

the credit facility provides for an interest rate at our election of either libor or a base rate in each case plus a leveragebased margin as of december 31 2017  the interest rates on the term a loan the term a2 loan and the term b2 loan were 332  324  and 357  respectively and the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was 324  the credit facility also provides for a commitment fee with respect to borrowings under the revolving credit facility at an applicable rate per annum ranging from 020  to 030  depending on our leverage ratio as of december 31 2017  the aggregate outstanding balance on the term loans was 39 billion  and the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was 7650 million  

the term a loan and the term a2 loan mature and the revolving credit facility expires on may 2 2022  the term b2 loan matures on april 22 2023  the term a loan principal must be repaid in quarterly installments in the amount of 125  of principal through june 2019  increasing to 1875  of principal through june 2021  and increasing to 250  of principal through march 2022  with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in may 2022  the term a2 loan principal must be repaid in quarterly installments of 17 million  through june 2018  increasing to quarterly installments of 86 million  through march 2022  with the remaining balance due upon maturity in may 2022  the term b2 loan principal must be repaid in quarterly installments in the amount of 025  of principal through march 2023  with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in april 2023  

the credit facility allows us to issue standby letters of credit of up to 100 million in the aggregate under the revolving credit facility outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us borrowings available to us under the revolving credit facility are further limited by the covenants described below under compliance with covenants the total available commitments under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2017  were 4733 million  

settlement lines of credit 

in various markets where we do business we have lines of credit which are restricted for use in funding settlement the settlement lines of credit generally have variable interest rates are subject to annual review and are denominated in local currency but may in some cases facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies for certain of our lines of credit the available credit is increased 

by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender accordingly the amount of the outstanding line of credit may exceed the stated credit limit as of december 31 2017  and 2016 a total of 593 million  and 510 million  respectively of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had 6352 million  and 3921 million  respectively outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity of 6894 million  as of december 31 2017  to fund settlement the weightedaverage interest rate on these borrowings was 20  and 190  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

  

compliance with covenants 

the credit facility contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants including among others financial covenants based on our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as defined in the agreement as of december 31 2017  financial covenants under the credit facility required a leverage ratio no greater than i 450  to 100  as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period from july 1 2017 through june 30 2018 ii 425  to 100  as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period from july 1 2018 through june 30 2019 and iii 400  to 100  as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending thereafter the fixed charge coverage ratio is required to be no less than 225  to 100  

the credit facility and settlement lines of credit also include various other covenants that are customary in such borrowings the credit facility includes covenants subject in each case to exceptions and qualifications that may restrict certain payments including in certain circumstances the payment of cash dividends in excess of our current rate of 001  per share per quarter 

the credit facility also includes customary events of default the occurrence of which following any applicable cure period would permit the lenders to among other things declare the principal accrued interest and other obligations to be immediately due and payable we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of and for the year ended december 31 2017  

see note 7 —longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our borrowing arrangements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees subordinated retained interest derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks contingent liabilities or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing liquidity market or credit risk support other than the guarantee services described under critical accounting policies below 

binica agreements 

  

we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain banks these agreements allow us to use the banks identification numbers referred to as bank identification number bin for visa transactions and interbank card association ica number for mastercard transactions to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard certain of such agreements contain financial covenants and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december 31 2017  

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2017  



1 interest on longterm debt is based on rates effective and amounts borrowed as of december 31 2017  the estimated effect of interest rate swaps is included in interest on longterm debt since the contractual rates for our longterm debt and settlements on our interest rate swaps are variable actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided 

2 includes estimate of future payments for noncancelable contractual obligations related to service arrangements with suppliers for fixed or minimum amounts 

3 under the 2017 us tax act a companys foreign earnings accumulated under legacy tax laws are deemed repatriated with a onetime mandatory transition tax on foreign earnings not previously subjected to us income tax the transition tax on those deemed repatriated earnings may be paid over eight years the total amount of the transition tax payable and the payments due by future period are estimates as of december 31 2017  and subject to change see note 9 —income tax in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more discussion about the effects of the 2017 us tax act on our accounting for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017  

the table above excludes other obligations that we may have such as employee benefit obligations and other noncurrent liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet because the timing of the related payments is not determinable or because there is no contractual obligation associated with the underlying obligations 

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements because the application of these policies requires significant judgment on the part of management and as a result actual future developments may be different from those expected at the time that we make these critical judgments we have discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions therefore the following descriptions of our critical accounting policies are forwardlooking statements and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forwardlooking statements you should read the following in conjunction with note 1 —basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in item 1a  risk factors of this annual report on form 10k 

goodwill 

we have historically performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of january 1 as a result of the change in our fiscal year end from may 31 to december 31 we elected to change our annual goodwill impairment test date from january 1 to october 1 to give us sufficient time to complete our assessment in conjunction with our yearend reporting we performed an annual goodwill impairment test on january 1 2017 and on october 1 2017  

we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary the option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit 

factors we consider in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance of our reporting units events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of our reporting units sustained decrease in our share price and other relevant entityspecific events if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount a quantitative test would be required 

during the first quarter of 2017  we revised our reporting unit structure within our north america segment to reflect changes made in connection with the integration of heartland under the revised reporting unit structure we operate two reporting units in our north america segment i payments and ii integrated solutions and vertical markets we reassigned the goodwill previously allocated to north america merchant services and heartland to the two new reporting units using a relative fair value approach as a result of the change in reporting units we performed goodwill impairment tests immediately before and after this change in reporting units and determined that there was no impairment 

  

following the revision described above we now have seven  reporting units north america payments north america integrated solutions and vertical markets uk merchant services asiapacific merchant services central and eastern europe merchant services russia merchant services and spain merchant services as of october 1 2017  we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of impairment for each of our reporting units we determined on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of each reporting unit was not more likely than not less than the respective carrying amounts we believe that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount 

intangible and longlived assets 

other intangible assets include customerrelated intangible assets such as customer lists and merchant contracts contractbased intangible assets such as noncompete agreements referral agreements and processing rights acquired technology and trademarks associated with acquisitions these assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives the useful lives for customerrelated intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows which include estimates for the revenues expenses and customer attrition associated with the assets the useful lives of contractbased intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements the useful lives of amortizable trademarks and trade names are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks and trade names in the applicable markets acquired technology is amortized on a straightline basis over its estimated useful life 

amortization for most of our customerrelated intangible assets is calculated using an accelerated method in determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset we multiply that percentage by the initial carrying amount of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period if the cash flow patterns that we experience differ significantly from our initial estimates we adjust the amortization schedule prospectively these cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business we did not make any significant adjustments to the amortization schedules of our intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2017  

we believe that our accelerated method better approximates the expected distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships we use the straightline method of amortization for our contractbased intangibles and amortizable trademarks 

we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amount of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may not be recoverable when factors indicate that these longlived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying amount of such longlived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable and exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recorded measured as the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount fair values are determined based on quoted market prices 

or discounted cash flow analysis as applicable we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the useful lives of property and equipment and finitelife intangible assets may warrant revision 

capitalization of internaluse software 

we develop software that is used in providing services to customers capitalization of internaluse software primarily associated with operating platforms occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage management authorizes the project management commits to funding the project it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended the preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives the evaluation of alternatives the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred currently unforeseen circumstances in software development such as a significant change in the manner in which the software is intended to be used obsolescence or a significant reduction in revenues due to merchant attrition could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs the carrying amount of internaluse software including work in progress at december 31 2017  was 3272 million  costs capitalized during the year ended december 31 2017  the 2016  fiscal transition period and the years ended may 31 2016  and 2015  totaled 793 million  377 million  365 million  and 351 million  respectively internaluse software is amortized over its estimated useful life which is typically 2  to 10  years in a manner that best reflects the pattern of economic use of the assets 

income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using managements judgments estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 

accounting standards codification asc topic 740 income taxes asc 740 requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment to address the application of gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 us tax act which was enacted on december 22 2017  the sec staff issued sab 118 sab 118 provides guidance for registrants regarding the application of asc topic 740 in the reporting period that includes december 22 2017  including reporting provisional amounts for those specific income tax effects of the 2017 us tax act for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined in addition sab 118 requires provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts identified in the measurement period as defined to be included as an adjustment to tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the period the amounts are determined 

as a result of the enactment of the 2017 us tax act our income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2017  included a net benefit of 1587 million  reflecting provisional amounts for specific income tax effects as a result of the enactment of the 2017 us tax act for which our accounting is incomplete but could be reasonably estimated as of december 31 2017  we are in the process of determining the actual effect of the 2017 us tax act our reasonable estimates are based on provisional amounts that may be adjusted upon obtaining preparing or analyzing additional information we could make adjustments to the provisional amounts of the tax effects during subsequent periods in 2018 

sab 118 provides that the measurement period is complete when a companys accounting is complete and in no circumstances should the measurement period extend beyond one year from the enactment date due to the timing of enactment of this new tax legislation certain details of the 2017 us tax act may not be fully understood or operationalized by the time we issue this annual report on form 10k further guidance could be forthcoming from the us treasury the sec or the accounting profession that could give rise to further effects of the 2017 us tax act on our consolidated financial statements in future periods the effect of the 2017 us tax act on our consolidated financial statements and the status of our accounting for its effects is further described along with other disclosures required by sab 118 in note 9 —income taxes of the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

we believe our tax return positions are fully supportable however we recognize the benefit for tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on its technical merits issues raised by a tax authority may be resolved at an amount different than the related benefit recognized when facts and circumstances change including an effective settlement 

of an issue or statute of limitations expiration the effect is recognized in the period of change a portion of the unrecognized tax benefits that exist at december 31 2017  would affect our provision for income taxes in the future if recognized judgment is required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized to the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets then these deferred tax assets are adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made 

effect of new accounting pronouncements  recently issued pronouncements not yet adopted   

as more fully described in note 1 —basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements effective january 1 2018 we will adopt a new revenue accounting standard that will change the presentation of certain fees that we pay to third parties and currently present as an operating expense effective january 1 2018 our revenues will be presented net of such payments including payment network fees which represented approximately 23  of our total consolidated revenues in 2017 we expect a similar amount of payment network fees in 2018 this change in presentation of fees paid to third parties will reduce our reported revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and will have no effect on operating income 

the application of the new standard will also change the amount and timing of revenue and expenses to be recognized under certain of our customer arrangements for periods after december 31 2017 further we will also be required to capitalize additional costs to obtain contracts with customers as well as certain implementation and setup costs and in some cases will be required to amortize these costs and costs that we currently capitalize such as capitalized customer acquisition costs over a longer time period we currently estimate that the net effect of applying the provision of the new accounting standard will be an increase of less than 1 of our operating income in 2018

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

certain of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies consequently a portion of our revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not historically hedged our translation risk on foreign currency exposure but we may do so in the future for the year ended december 31 2017  currency rate fluctuations calculated by converting revenues and expenses for the year ended december 31 2017  in local currency using prioryear period rates had an immaterial effect on our revenues and operating income for the 2016  fiscal transition period currency rate fluctuations reduced our revenues by 353 million  and our operating income by 198 million  as compared to the prioryear period calculated by converting current period revenues and expenses in local currency using the prioryear period rates for the year ended may 31 2016  currency rate fluctuations reduced our revenues by 1170 million  and our operating income by 436 million  as compared to the prioryear period calculated by converting revenues and expenses for the year ended may 31 2016  in local currency using prioryear period rates 

generally the functional currency of our various subsidiaries is their local currency we are exposed to currency fluctuations on transactions that are not denominated in the functional currency gains and losses on such transactions are included in determining net income for the period we seek to mitigate our foreign currency risk through timely settlement of transactions and cash flow matching when possible for the year ended december 31 2017  the 2016  fiscal transition period and the years ended may 31 2016  and 2015 our transaction gains and losses were insignificant 

additionally we are affected by currency fluctuations in our funds settlement process on merchant payment chargeback and card network settlement transactions that are not denominated in the currency of the underlying credit or debit card transaction gains and losses on these transactions are included in revenues for the period 

we are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on our investments in foreign operations relative to our net investment in foreign operations the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is a foreign currency are translated at the periodend rate of exchange the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and 

is included in shareholders equity transaction gains and losses on intercompany balances of a longterm investment nature are also recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our longterm debt and cash investments we invest our excess cash in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term these investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 

we have a credit facility for general corporate purposes as well as various lines of credit that we use to fund settlement in certain of our markets interest rates on these debt instruments and settlement lines of credit are based on market rates and fluctuate accordingly as of december 31 2017  47 billion  was outstanding under these variablerate debt arrangements and settlement lines of credit 

the interest earned on our invested cash and the interest paid on our debt are based on variable interest rates therefore the exposure of our net income to a change in interest rates is partially mitigated as an increase in rates would increase both interest income and interest expense and a reduction in rates would decrease both interest income and interest expense under our current policies we may selectively use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements to manage all or a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes we have interest rate swaps that reduce a portion of our exposure to market interest rate risk on our liborbased debt as discussed in note 7 —longterm debt and lines of credit in the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 

based on balances outstanding under variablerate debt agreements and invested cash balances at december 31 2017  a hypothetical increase of 50 basis points in applicable interest rates as of december 31 2017  would increase our annual interest expense by approximately 202 million  and increase our annual interest income by approximately 35 million  




 item 9  changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

  

none 




 item 9a  controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as of december 31 2017  management carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based on this evaluation our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2017  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management including our principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

  

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in the  internal control  integrated framework 2013  

we completed our acquisition of active network on september 1 2017  as permitted by the sec rules and regulations managements assessment did not include the internal control of the acquired operations of active network which are included in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017 and for the period from the acquisition date through december 31 2017 in accordance with our integration efforts we plan to incorporate active networks operations into our internal control over financial reporting program within the time period provided by applicable sec rules and regulations the assets excluding goodwill of active network constituted approximately 43 of our total consolidated assets as of december 31 2017  active networks revenues were less than 15 of our total consolidated revenues and active network did not contribute to our consolidated operating income for the year ended december 31 2017  

based on the results of its evaluation which excluded an assessment of the internal control of the acquired operations of active network management believes that as of december 31 2017  our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in this annual report 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override due to such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate such risk 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

on april 22 2016  we completed our merger with heartland which we have since been integrating into our north america segment as part of our integration activities we have completed the incorporation of heartlands operations into our internal control over financial reporting program 

on september 1 2017  we completed our acquisition of active network which is being integrated into our north america segment as part of our ongoing integration activities we are continuing to apply our controls and procedures to the active network and to augment our companywide controls to reflect the risks inherent in an acquisition of this magnitude 

we also added internal controls over the disclosures related to the expected accounting and reporting effects of the new revenue accounting standard which is effective for us as of january 1 2018 as well as the provisional effects on our accounting and disclosure for income taxes during the year ended december 31 2017  as a result of the 2017 us tax act and the related accounting guidance issued by the sec 

there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of calendar 2017 as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting
