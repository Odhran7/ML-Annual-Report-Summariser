 item 1a risk factors tableend

the factors described below represent the companys principal risks 

climate change  related risks

the company is subject to increasing climaterelated risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of its control climate change may result in more frequent severe weather events potential changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns which can disrupt the operations of the company as well as those of its customers partners and vendors 

the transition to lower greenhouse gas emissions technology the effects of carbon pricing and changes in public sentiment regulations taxes public mandates or requirements and increases in climaterelated lawsuits insurance premiums and implementation of more robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans could increase costs to maintain or resume the company’s operations or achieve its sustainability commitments in the expected timeframes which would negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

in 2020 the company announced commitments to reduce its net annual greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 5 million metric tons or 15 percent compared with its 2020 baseline by 2030 the 2020 baseline represents a 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2005 and its intention to be carbon neutral by 2050 scopes 123 as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol plus product benefits execution and achievement of these commitments within the currently projected costs and expected timeframes are also subject to risks and uncertainties which include but are not limited to advancement availability development and affordability of technology necessary to achieve these commitments unforeseen design operational and technological difficulties availability of necessary materials and components adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions changes in public sentiment and political leadership the company’s ability to comply with changing regulations taxes mandates or requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions or other climaterelated matters and the pace of regional and global recovery from the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 given the focus on sustainable investing if the company fails to meet its climate change commitments within the committed timeframe and adopt policies and practices to enhance sustainability the company’s reputation and its customer and other stakeholder relationships could be negatively impacted and it may be more difficult for the company to compete effectively or gain access to financing on acceptable terms when needed which would have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

covid19 pandemic  related risks 

public health crisis a public health crisis or global outbreak of disease including the pandemic caused by covid19 has had and could continue to have a negative effect on the companys manufacturing operations supply chain and workforce creating business disruptions that could continue to have a substantial negative impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the pandemic caused by covid19 has impacted all geographic regions where dow products are produced and sold the global regional and local spread of covid19 including existing and new variants has resulted in significant global mitigation measures including governmentdirected quarantines social distancing and shelterinplace mandates travel restrictions andor bans mask and vaccination mandates restrictions on large gatherings and restricted access to certain corporate facilities and manufacturing sites uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic coupled with oil price fluctuations due in part to the global spread of covid19 and the continued increase in global cases has contributed to the volatility of financial markets while the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic in key geographic regions and endmarkets cannot be reasonably estimated at this time impacts to the company include but are not limited to fluctuations in the company’s stock price due to market volatility a decrease in demand for certain company products price declines reduced profitability supply chain disruptions impeding the company’s ability to ship andor receive product temporary idling or permanent closure of select manufacturing facilities andor manufacturing assets asset impairment charges interruptions or limitations to manufacturing operations imposed by local state or federal governments reduced market liquidity and increased borrowing costs workforce absenteeism and distraction labor shortages customer credit concerns increased cyber security risk and data accessibility disruptions due to remote working arrangements workforce reductions and fluctuations in foreign currency markets additional risks may include but are not limited to shortages of key raw materials potential impairment in the carrying value of goodwill additional asset impairment charges increased obligations related to the company’s pension and other 

postretirement benefit plans and tax valuation allowances business disruptions and market volatility resulting from the covid19 pandemic have had and could have a substantial negative impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this risk factors section 

macroeconomic risks 

financial commitments and credit markets market conditions could reduce the companys flexibility to respond to changing business conditions or fund capital needs 

adverse economic conditions could reduce the company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs the economic environment could result in a contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace and reduce sources of liquidity for the company this could result in higher borrowing costs 

global economic considerations the company operates in a global competitive environment which gives rise to operating and market risk exposure 

the company sells its broad range of products and services in a competitive global environment and competes worldwide for sales on the basis of product quality price technology and customer service increased levels of competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volume which could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations sales of the companys products are also subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws and regulations trade agreements import and export controls taxes and duties and tariffs the imposition of additional regulations controls taxes and duties and tariffs or changes to bilateral and regional trade agreements could result in lower sales volume which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

economic conditions around the world and in certain industries in which the company does business also impact sales price and volume as a result market uncertainty or an economic downturn driven by political tensions war terrorism epidemics pandemics or political instability in the geographic regions or industries in which the company sells its products could reduce demand for these products and result in decreased sales volume which could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

in addition volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit customers’ ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations which could result in a decrease in sales volume and have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations the company’s global business operations also give rise to market risk exposure related to changes in inflation foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices to manage such risks the company enters into hedging transactions where deemed appropriate pursuant to established guidelines and policies if the company fails to effectively manage such risks it could have a negative impact on its results of operations 

pension and other postretirement benefits increased obligations and expenses related to the companys defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations 

the company has defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans the “plans” in the united states and a number of other countries the assets of the companys funded plans are primarily invested in fixed income securities equity securities of us and foreign issuers and alternative investments including investments in real estate private equity and absolute return strategies changes in the market value of plan assets investment returns discount rates mortality rates regulations and the rate of increase in compensation levels may affect the funded status of the companys plans and could cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status of the plans a significant increase in the companys obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the companys financial condition 

supplydemand balance earnings generated by the companys products vary based in part on the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry 

the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry may be significantly impacted by the addition of new capacity especially for basic commodities where capacity is generally added in large increments as worldscale facilities are built this may disrupt industry balances and result in downward pressure on prices due to the increase in supply which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

environmental compliance the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the companys financial results actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment climate change greenhouse gas emissions and the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials in addition the company may have costs related to environmental remediation and restoration obligations associated with past and current sites as well as related to its past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling although management will estimate and accrue liabilities for these obligations it is reasonably possible that the company’s ultimate cost with respect to these matters could be significantly higher which could negatively impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the company’s operations or require modifications to its facilities accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities for additional information see part ii item 7 other matters environmental matters in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

health and safety increased concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on the environment has resulted in more restrictive regulations and could lead to new regulations 

concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection these concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance and continued pressure for more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation these concerns could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of the companys products its reputation and the cost to comply with regulations in addition terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution these concerns could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

local state federal and foreign governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals which could result in higher operating costs 

litigation the company is party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to product liability patent infringement employment matters governmental tax and regulation disputes contract and commercial litigation and other actions 

certain of the claims and lawsuits facing the company purport to be class actions and seek damages in very large amounts all such claims are contested with the exception of the possible effect of the asbestosrelated liability of union carbide corporation “union carbide” and chapter 11 related matters of dow silicones corporation dow silicones as described below it is the opinion of the company’s management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestosrelated suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades at december 31 2021 union carbides total asbestosrelated liability including future defense and processing costs was 1016 million 1098 million at december 31 2020 

in 1995 dow silicones a former 5050 joint venture voluntarily filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in order to resolve breast implant liabilities and related matters the “chapter 11 proceeding” dow silicones emerged from the chapter 11 proceeding on june 1 2004 and is implementing the joint plan of reorganization the “plan” the plan provides funding for the resolution of breast implant and other product liability litigation covered by the chapter 11 proceeding dow silicones’ liability for breast implant and other product liability claims was 130 million at december 31 2021 160 million at december 31 2020 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on litigation matters 

plastic waste increased concerns regarding plastic waste in the environment consumers selectively reducing their consumption of plastic products a lack of plastic waste collection and recycling infrastructure or new or more restrictive regulations and rules related to plastic waste could reduce demand for the company’s plastic products and could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

local state federal and foreign governments have been increasingly proposing regulations to address the global plastic waste challenge including but not limited to extended producer responsibility fees a global plastics treaty and bans on nonessential items these regulations on plastic waste drive demand toward plastic solutions that are recyclable reusable made with recycled content andor renewable raw materials in addition without proper waste collection and recycling infrastructure at scale plastics have faced increased public scrutiny due to negative coverage of plastic waste in the environment including the world’s oceans and rivers as dow is one of the world’s largest producers of plastics increased pressure on the use of plastics despite positive carbon benefits and essential functions such as food preservation and medical uses could cause reduced demand for the company’s polyethylene products which could negatively impact the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

operational and strategic risks 

company strategy implementing certain elements of the companys strategy could negatively impact its financial results 

the company currently has manufacturing operations sales and marketing activities and joint ventures in emerging geographic regions activities in these geographic regions are accompanied by uncertainty and risks including navigating different government regulatory environments relationships with new local partners project funding commitments and guarantees expropriation military actions war terrorism and political instability sabotage uninsurable risks suppliers not performing as expected resulting in increased risk of extended project timelines and determining raw material supply and other details regarding product movement in addition disruptions to supply chains distribution chains andor public and private infrastructure including those caused by industry capacity constraints material availability global logistics delays and constraints arising from among other things the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers and labor availability constraints could materially and adversely impact our business operations if the manufacturing operations supply chains sales and marketing activities andor implementation of these projects is not successful it could adversely affect the company’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

cyber threat the risk of loss of the company’s trade secrets knowhow or other sensitive business information or disruption of operations could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

cyberattacks or security breaches could compromise confidential business critical information cause a disruption in the company’s operations or harm the companys reputation the company has attractive information assets including trade secrets knowhow and other sensitive business critical information while the company has a comprehensive cybersecurity program that is continuously reviewed maintained and upgraded a significant cyberattack could result in the loss of critical business information andor could negatively impact operations which could have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

goodwill an impairment of goodwill could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

at least annually the company assesses goodwill for impairment if testing indicates that goodwill is impaired the carrying value is written down based on fair value with a charge against earnings where the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology in determining fair value continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment accordingly any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill could negatively impact the companys results of operations see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the companys goodwill impairment testing 

operational event a significant operational event could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

as a diversified chemical manufacturing company the companys operations the transportation of products cyberattacks pandemics and other public healthrelated events or severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena such as freezing drought hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods etc could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations neighbors or the public at large which could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

major hurricanes and other weatherrelated events have caused significant disruption in the companys operations on the us gulf coast logistics across the region and the supply of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of its products due to the companys substantial presence on the us gulf coast similar severe weather conditions or other natural phenomena in the future could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

raw materials availability of purchased feedstock and energy and the volatility of these costs impact dow’s operating costs and add variability to earnings 

purchased feedstock and energy costs account for a substantial portion of the company’s total production costs and operating expenses the company purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane propane butane naphtha and condensate as feedstocks and also purchases certain monomers primarily ethylene and propylene to supplement internal production as well as other raw materials the company also purchases natural gas primarily to generate electricity and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation 

feedstock and energy costs generally follow price trends in crude oil and natural gas which are sometimes volatile while the company uses its feedstock flexibility and financial and physical hedging programs to help mitigate feedstock cost increases the company is not always able to immediately raise selling prices ultimately the ability to pass on underlying cost increases is dependent on market conditions conversely when feedstock and energy costs decline selling prices generally decline as well as a result volatility in these costs could impact the company’s results of operations 

the company has a number of investments on the us gulf coast to take advantage of increasing supplies of lowcost natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls derived from shale gas including the st charles operations sco2 ethylene production facility which commenced operations in december 2012 an onpurpose propylene production facility which commenced operations in december 2015 an ethylene production facility in plaquemine louisiana which included expanding the facility’s ethylene production capacity and modifications to enable full ethane cracking flexibility completion of a new integrated worldscale ethylene production facility and a new elite™ enhanced polyethylene production facility both located in freeport texas in 2017 and a capacity expansion project which brought the facility’s total ethylene capacity to 2000 kilotonnes per annum in 2020 and the company commenced operations in 2018 on its new ldpe production facility and its new nordel™ metallocene epdm production facility both located in plaquemine louisiana as a result of these investments the company’s exposure to purchased ethylene and propylene is expected to decline offset by increased exposure to ethane and propanebased feedstocks 

while the company expects abundant and costadvantaged supplies of ngls in the united states to persist for the foreseeable future if ngls become significantly less advantaged than crude oilbased feedstocks it could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and future investments also if the company’s key suppliers of feedstock and energy are unable to provide the raw materials required for production it could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations

outlook 

operating segments  endmarket expectations 

in 2022 economic forecasts are projecting above average global gross domestic product gdp growth rates due to strong industrial and consumer demand trends which have the potential to positively impact sales volume inflationary impacts on natural gas and feedstocks driven by external macroeconomic and geopolitical factors remain a potential risk in the nearterm but are expected to be moderate as warmer weather lowers demand for heating supply the company anticipates constructive global demand for crude oil compared with 2021 due to ongoing recovery in travel and mobility crude oil fundamentals suggest global supply will lag the growing demand that provides support to oil prices and oiltogas spreads 

in packaging  specialty plastics supply improvements following significant weatherrelated disruptions in 2021 are expected to drive sales volume on continued underlying demand strength notably in flexible food and specialty packaging industrial and consumer packaging and functional polymers integrated margins are expected to stabilize with recent industry supply additions the company’s regional feedstock cost advantages will help offset elevated raw material and energy costs other important factors that will impact performance are raw material and logistics challenges industry operating rates and timing of additional industry capacity startups 

in industrial intermediates  infrastructure volume growth is expected across the portfolio driven by continued underlying demand strength for products used in furniture and bedding appliances automotive construction electronics and pharma applications the methylene diphenyl diisocyanate value chain is expected to remain tight with industry capacity additions trailing demand growth propylene oxide is expected to be impacted by new capacity entering the market particularly in asia pacific ethylene oxide supply is expected to remain tight with limited industry capacity additions in the nearterm and continued demand strength margins for the segment are expected to benefit from highvalue specialties aligned to strategic incremental growth capacity additions 

in performance materials  coatings sales growth is expected in downstream silicones particularly for products used in mobility and transportation high performance building and construction industrial consumer and electronics applications the company continues to pursue incremental downstream silicones capacity debottlenecking and growth projects to meet demand growth in consumerdriven endmarkets within siloxanes increased supply availability is expected to drive sales volume global demand strength in architectural and industrial coatings is expected to drive sales volume the company remains wellpositioned to benefit from its customers’ shift to sustainable chemistries where dow has unique technologies and solutions to offer in both business units 

other factors impacting operating segment profitability include 

• planned maintenance turnaround spending is expected to increase approximately 100 million compared with 2021 due to inflationary pressures on materials and labor

goodwill 

the company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level reporting units are the level at which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by business management on a regular basis the company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative andor quantitative testing procedures the separation from dowdupont on april 1 2019 did not impact the composition of the companys six reporting units coatings  performance monomers consumer solutions hydrocarbons  energy industrial solutions packaging and specialty plastics and polyurethanes  construction chemicals the ecp businesses received as part of the separation from dowdupont are included in the hydrocarbons  energy and packaging and specialty plastics reporting units at december 31 2021 goodwill was carried by five out of six of the companys reporting units 

the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rates longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices equity and credit market activity discount rates foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and new product launches cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete qualitative testing for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value additional quantitative testing is required 

quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value if the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units this valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the companys reporting units however where market comparables are available the company includes ebitebitda multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis the discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions projected revenue growth rates or compounded annual growth rates discount rates tax rates terminal values currency exchange rates and forecasted longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices by geographic region and by year which include the companys key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil due to its correlation to naphtha currency exchange rates and longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices are established for the company as a whole and applied consistently to all reporting units while revenue growth rates discount rates and tax rates are established by reporting unit to account for differences in business fundamentals and industry risk these key assumptions drive projected ebitebitda and ebitebitda margins which are key elements of management’s internal control over the reporting unit valuation analysis 

2021 goodwill impairment testing 

in 2021 there were no events or changes in circumstances that warranted interim goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2021 qualitative testing was performed for all reporting units carrying goodwill based on the results of the qualitative testing the company did not perform quantitative testing on any reporting units for the qualitative testing management considered factors at both the company level and the reporting unit level based on the qualitative testing for the reporting units management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled at december 31 2021 rate of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods the us pension plans represent 71 percent of the company’s pension plan assets and 70 percent of the pension obligations 

the company uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the us and other selected countries under the spot rate approach the company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual spot rates from the willis towers watson ratelink yield curve based on highquality corporate bond yields for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost service cost and interest cost for all other plans including all plans prior to adoption are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations 

the following information relates to the us plans only a similar approach is used for the company’s nonus plans 

the company determines the expected longterm rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the companys investment committee and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class the company’s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered the expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience the expected longterm rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year the weightedaverage longterm rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2021 was 796 percent the weightedaverage assumption to be used for determining 2022 net periodic pension expense is 795 percent future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company’s pension plans 

the discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the us plans are based on the yield on highquality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date future expected actuarially determined cash flows for the company’s us plans are individually discounted at the spot rates under the willis towers watson us ratelink 6090 corporate yield curve based on 60th to 90th percentile highquality corporate bond yields to arrive at the plan’s obligations as of the measurement date the weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations increased to 304 percent at december 31 2021 from 271 percent at december 31 2020 

at december 31 2021 the us taxqualified plans were underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis by 2585 million the underfunded amount decreased 3288 million compared with december 31 2020 the decrease in the underfunded amount in 2021 was primarily due to the impact of higher discount rates overall favorable asset returns a 1 billion contribution to the us taxqualified pension plans and plan design changes 

the assumption for the longterm rate for compensation levels for the us taxqualified plans was unchanged the company uses a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations 

the following discussion relates to the company’s significant pension plans 

the company bases the determination of pension expense on a marketrelated valuation of plan assets that reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets since the marketrelated value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded over the life of the plans both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized at december 31 2021 net gains of 1628 million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of plan assets these net gains will result in decreases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the net increase in the marketrelated value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains is presented in the following table 



exclusive of onetime curtailment gains recognized in 2021 the company expects pension expense to decrease in 2022 by approximately 25 million the decrease is driven by a reduction in the amortization of actuarial losses 

a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the longterm return on assets assumption would change the company’s total pension expense for 2022 by 62 million a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would decrease the companys total pension expense for 2022 by 53 million a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the companys total pension expense for 2022 by 55 million a 25 basis point change in the longterm return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for 2022 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence both positive and negative the company recognizes future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 

at december 31 2021 the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of 852 million after valuation allowances of 1391 million 

in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets the company relies on in order of increasing subjectivity taxable income in prior carryback years the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results 

at december 31 2021 the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of 1784 million 864 million of which is subject to expiration in the years 2022 through 2026 in order to realize the deferred tax assets for operating tax loss and tax credit carryforwards the company needs taxable income of approximately 25034 million across multiple jurisdictions the taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for operating tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration from 2022 through 2026 is approximately 14748 million 

the company files tax returns in multiple jurisdictions and is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world tax authorities have the ability to review and challenge matters that could be subject to differing interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount character timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of tax attributes the ultimate resolution of such uncertainties could last 

several years when an uncertain tax position is identified the company considers and interprets complex tax laws and regulations in order to determine the need for recognizing a provision in its financial statements significant judgment is required in determining the timing and measurement of uncertain tax positions the company utilizes internal and external expertise in interpreting tax laws to support the companys tax positions the company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination at december 31 2021 the company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of 580 million and 502 million for interest and penalties

climate change 

climate change matters for the company are likely to be driven by several categories of risks related to the transition to a lowercarbon economy “transition risks” and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change “physical risks” 

transition risks 

transition risks include carbon pricing mechanisms transition to lower greenhouse gas emissions technology increased cost of raw materials and mandates on and regulation of existing products and services carbon pricing is a marketbased strategy to address climate change by putting a monetary value on greenhouse gas emissions allowing for the costs of climate impacts and opportunities for lowcarbon energy options to be reflected in production and consumption choices approximately 35 percent of dow’s scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions are generated from operations in canada and the european union “eu” where carbon pricing is already in place as part of the european green deal the european commission proposed a 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 55 percent below 1990 levels with a goal for the eu to be carbon neutral by 2050 in china an emissions trading system initially proposed to cover the power sector only is expected to gradually expand to cover a total of eight sectors including the petrochemical and chemical industries though no specific timeline for implementation and expansion has been outlined 

these carbon pricing mechanisms will not only increase dow’s direct costs to operate but will also result in increased energy costs dow mitigates the direct cost impact of existing regulation through research and 

development projects designed to increase energy efficiency and capital investment projects that will reduce the company’s energy usage and carbon footprint the company is also exploring options for carbon capture utilization and storage “ccus” and electrification of dow’s processes dow sees ccus as a mechanism to help bridge the time period between the onset of increased carbon regulation and the technology available to economically reduce dow’s greenhouse gas emissions dow also incorporates a theoretical internal carbon price into its business planning and risk management strategies this theoretical price of carbon is also included in internal calculations used for prioritizing capital projects ultimately the goal of utilizing an internal carbon price is to mitigate the risk of dow’s carbon exposure to help ensure future resiliency 

physical risks 

operationally climate change may result in more frequent severe weather events potential changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns which can disrupt operations several of dow’s production facilities are located in waterscarce areas and water shortages could impact normal production changes in average precipitation could have an impact on the availability and price of water the company has engineered susceptible facilities particularly on the us gulf coast to better withstand severe weather and rising sea levels and continues to study the longterm implications of changing climate parameters on water availability plant siting issues and other impacts preparedness plans are developed that detail actions needed in the event of severe weather these measures have historically been in place and these activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness 

climate action 

the transition to a lowcarbon economy remains one of societys fundamental challenges the company continues to progress toward its defined 2025 sustainability goals which are the foundation of dows efforts to help lead the transition to a sustainable planet and society and is taking further action to lessen its carbon impact moving forward in 2020 the company announced a new multidecade target to reduce its net annual greenhouse gas emissions by 5 million metric tons by 2030 compared with its 2020 baseline a reduction of approximately 15 percent and announced its intention to be carbon neutral by 2050 scopes 123 as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol plus product benefits 

to achieve the 2030 carbon reduction target dow developed a climate protection action plan which includes the following elements 

• optimizing energy efficiency of facilities and processes 

• increasing renewables in purchased power mix 

• investments in ccus 

• developing lowcarbon technologies for emission reductions 

• deploying materials to enable greenhouse gas emissions reductions for customers and industries 

the action plan has resulted in new and expanded renewable power purchase agreements in 2020 dow increased its existing access to renewable power by more than 50 percent to over 800 megawatts of renewable power exceeding its 2025 sustainability goal target of 750 megawatts the company also initiated a joint development agreement with shell to develop electrified cracking technology powered by clean energy 

in 2021 dow announced additional renewable and cleaner power agreements that increase dows access to over 850 megawatts of renewable power and are expected to reduce scope 2 emissions by more than 600000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year dow also announced a plan to build the world’s first netzero carbon emissions with respect to scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide emissions including technology advancements site in alberta canada which will decarbonize 20 percent of dow’s global ethylene capacity while growing polyethylene supply with expected completion by 2030 at dows largest european manufacturing site in terneuzen the netherlands the company has outlined a multigenerational plan to reduce current carbon emissions at the site by more than 40 percent by 2030 as part of the companys goal to reduce companywide carbon emissions an additional 15 percent by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2050 other steps the company will take to achieve its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target include procuring more renewable energy at multiple sites modernizing louisiana operations energy assets completing us gulf coast flare recovery projects and advancing silicones feedstock capabilities in brazil the company expects to allocate approximately 1 billion of capital expenditures annually to decarbonize its global asset base in a phased sitebysite approach while driving growth 

the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures “tcfd” has developed a framework to help organizations more effectively disclose climaterelated risks and opportunities through existing reporting processes dow’s 2020 esg report includes disclosures aligned to the tcfd framework which includes four core pillars governance strategy risk management and metrics and targets the company intends to meet its commitment to fully implement the recommendations of the tcfd as part of the company’s 2021 esg report to be published in 2022 

advancing a circular economy 

transitioning to a circular economy is vital to both preserving and protecting earth’s natural resources and to the success of dows businesses to help advance a circular economy dow invests in new product technology value chain partnerships business models and waste management infrastructure to discover and scale sustainable solutions that extend the useful life of materials and the resources that are used to make them in 2020 dow announced stop the waste and close the loop goals to address plastic waste 

dows “stop the waste” goal is the companys commitment to invest andor collaborate in key technologies and infrastructure to significantly increase global recycling as part of this goal dow intends to enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected reused or recycled through direct actions and partnerships by 2030 dow will further stop the waste through application development where more recycled plastics can be incorporated into key applications through critical partnerships such as circulate capital and the alliance to end plastic waste and through incorporating waste into advanced recycling technologies 

dow continues to look for market applications for recycled plastics to keep plastic out of landfills one way to help stop the flow of this waste is to use recycled polymer modified asphalt for roads parking lots and other pavement polymer modified asphalt pma is a proven solution for making better pavement dows elvaloy™ reactive elastomeric terpolymer products have been enhancing pmas for more than 30 years resulting in excellent performance long service life and lower life cycle costs compared to conventional neat asphalt 

dows “close the loop” goal is the companys commitment to work directly with its customers brand owners and the value chain to help customers redesign and promote reusable or recyclable packaging applications where there is a clear environmental benefit and enable 100 percent of dow products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable by 2035 today dow enables approximately 80 percent of its products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable and continues to pursue application development packaging redesign and infrastructure improvements to deliver on the companys 100 percent commitment 

as one of the world’s largest producers of plastic dow wants to put an end to plastic waste eliminating plastic waste is about more than just recycling and reusing it is about creating innovative solutions that are sustainable and investing in the circular economy through recyclability and efficiency for plastic packaging dow aims to keep plastic waste out of the environment and retain its value as a resource by increasing impact through partnerships and delivering circular economy solutions 

environmental remediation 

the company accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and regulatory requirements the nature of such remediation can include management of soil and groundwater contamination the accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements to assess the impact on the financial statements environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability and the ability to apply remediation technologies these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available the company had an accrued liability of 983 million at december 31 2021 related to the remediation of current or former dowowned sites at december 31 2020 the liability related to remediation was 996 million 

in addition to current and former dowowned sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and equivalent state laws hereafter referred to collectively as superfund law the company is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where the company allegedly disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances because superfund law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site the company has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that have also been named potentially responsible parties “prps” at each site the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share the company’s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites was 237 million at december 31 2021 248 million at december 31 2020 the company has not recorded any thirdparty recovery related to these sites as a receivable

in the early days of operations at the midland manufacturing site wastes were usually disposed of onsite resulting in soil and groundwater contamination which has been contained and managed onsite under a series of resource conservation and recovery act permits and regulatory agreements  the hazardous waste operating license for the midland manufacturing site issued in 2003 and renewed and replaced in september 2015 also included provisions for the company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of offsite contamination from historic midland manufacturing site operations in january 2010 the company the us environmental protection agency epa and the state of michigan state entered into an administrative order on consent that requires the company to conduct a remedial investigation a feasibility study and a remedial design for the tittabawassee river the saginaw river and the saginaw bay and pay the oversight costs of the epa and the state under the authority of cercla see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to midland offsite environmental matters 

rohm and haas a wholly owned subsidiary of the company is a prp at the woodridge new jersey ventronvelsicol superfund site and the adjacent berry’s creek study area bcsa collectively the woodridge sites rohm and haas is a successor in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments in 2018 the berry’s creek study area potentially responsible party group “prp group” consisting of over 100 prps completed a remedial investigationfeasibility study for the bcsa during that time the epa concluded that an “iterative or adaptive approach” was appropriate for cleaning up the bcsa thus each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work in september 2018 the epa signed a record of decision rod 1 which describes the initial phase of the epa’s plan to cleanup the bcsa rod 1 will remediate waterways and major tributaries in the most contaminated part of the bcsa the prp group has signed agreements with the epa to design the selected remedy although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the bcsa and rohm and haass share of these costs has yet to be determined the range of activities that are required in the interim record of decision is known in general terms 

at december 31 2021 the company had accrued liabilities totaling 358 million 370 million at december 31 2020 for environmental remediation at the midland and woodridge sites in 2021 the company spent 38 million 53 million in 2020 for environmental remediation at the midland and woodridge sites 

during the third quarter of 2020 the company accrued additional liabilities totaling 106 million related to environmental remediation matters resulting from the companys evaluation of the costs required to manage remediation activities at sites dow will permanently shut down as part of its 2020 restructuring program in addition the company recorded indemnification assets of 50 million related to dow silicones environmental matters net of indemnifications the company recognized a pretax charge of 56 million related to these environmental matters included in restructuring goodwill impairment and asset related charges  net in the consolidated statements of income 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company accrued additional liabilities totaling 447 million related to environmental remediation matters at a number of current and historical locations the additional accrual primarily resulted from the culmination of longstanding negotiations and discussions with regulators and agencies including technical studies supporting higher cost estimates for final or staged remediation plans the company’s evaluation of the cost required to manage remediation activities at sites affected by dow’s separation from dowdupont and related agreements with corteva and dupont and the company’s review of its closure strategies and obligations to monitor ongoing operations and maintenance activities in addition the company recorded indemnification assets of 48 million related to dow silicones’ environmental matters net of indemnifications the company recognized a pretax charge of 399 million related to these environmental matters included in “cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income 

in total the company’s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was 1220 million at december 31 2021 compared with 1244 million at december 31 2020 this is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled 158 million in 2021 234 million in 2020 and 588 million in 2019 the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to operating the companys current pollution abatement facilities excluding internal recharges totaled 761 million in 2021 616 million in 2020 and 677 million in 2019 capital expenditures for environmental protection were 65 million in 2021 80 million in 2020 and 83 million in 2019 

asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation 

union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestosrelated suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestoscontaining products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining products located on union carbide’s premises and union carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary amchem in many cases plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide’s products 

the table below provides information regarding asbestosrelated claims pending against union carbide and amchem based on criteria developed by union carbide and its external consultants 



plaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants as a result the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to union carbide amchem or any other particular defendant even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury in fact there are no asbestos personal injury cases in which only union carbide andor amchem are the sole named defendants for these reasons and based upon union carbide’s litigation and settlement experience union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestosrelated liability

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

the company’s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices to manage such risks effectively the company enters into hedging transactions pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities where appropriate a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional nonspecific exposure within established limits and policies derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company’s results 

the global nature of the company’s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets the company has assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of the company’s foreign currency risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows to achieve this objective the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts overthecounter option contracts crosscurrency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies exposures primarily relate to assets liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies as well as economic exposure which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities the largest exposures are denominated in european currencies the chinese yuan the japanese yen and the thai baht although exposures also exist in other currencies in asia pacific canada latin america the middle east africa and india 

the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile to achieve this objective the company hedges using interest rate swaps “swaptions” and exchangetraded instruments the company’s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 

the company has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company’s market risk policies and procedures 

inherent in the company’s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments natural gas and crude oil along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production constitute the main commodity exposures overthecounter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 

the company uses valueatrisk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels the var methodology used by the company is a variancecovariance model this model uses a 975 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data the 2021 and 2020 yearend and average daily var for the aggregate of all positions are shown below these amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the company 



the company’s daily var for the aggregate of all positions increased from a composite var of 194 million at december 31 2020 to a composite var of 200 million at december 31 2021 the interest rate var increased due to an increase in interest rate exposure the equity securities var decreased due to a decrease in equity volatility and a decrease in equity exposure the foreign exchange var increased due to an increase in managed exposures the commodities var increased due to an increase in managed exposures see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding market risk

 item 1a risk factors tableend

the factors described below represent the companys principal risks 

covid19 pandemic  related risks 

public health crisis a public health crisis or global outbreak of disease including the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 “covid19” has had and could continue to have a negative effect on the companys manufacturing operations supply chain and workforce creating business disruptions that could continue to have a substantial negative impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the pandemic caused by covid19 has impacted all geographic regions where dow products are produced and sold the global regional and local spread of covid19 has resulted in significant global mitigation measures including governmentdirected quarantines social distancing and shelterinplace mandates travel restrictions andor bans and restricted access to certain corporate facilities and manufacturing sites uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic coupled with oil price fluctuations due in part to the global spread of covid19 and the continued increase in global cases has contributed to the volatility of financial markets while the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic in key geographic regions and endmarkets cannot be reasonably estimated at this time impacts to the company include but are not limited to fluctuations in the company’s stock price due to market volatility a decrease in demand for certain company products price declines reduced profitability supply chain disruptions impeding the company’s ability to ship andor receive product temporary idling or permanent closure of select manufacturing facilities andor manufacturing assets asset impairment charges interruptions or limitations to manufacturing operations imposed by local state or federal governments reduced market liquidity and increased borrowing costs workforce absenteeism and distraction labor shortages customer credit concerns increased cyber security risk and data accessibility disruptions due to remote working arrangements workforce reductions and fluctuations in foreign currency markets additional risks may include but are not limited to shortages of key raw materials potential impairment in the carrying value of goodwill additional asset impairment charges increased obligations related to the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans and tax valuation allowances business disruptions and market volatility resulting from the covid19 pandemic have had and could continue to have a substantial negative impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows the adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on the company may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this risk factors section 

macroeconomic risks 

financial commitments and credit markets market conditions could reduce the companys flexibility to respond to changing business conditions or fund capital needs 

adverse economic conditions could reduce the company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs the economic environment could result in a contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace and reduce sources of liquidity for the company this could result in higher borrowing costs 

global economic considerations the company operates in a global competitive environment which gives rise to operating and market risk exposure 

the company sells its broad range of products and services in a competitive global environment and competes worldwide for sales on the basis of product quality price technology and customer service increased levels of competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volume which could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations sales of the companys products are also subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws and regulations trade agreements import and export controls and duties and tariffs the imposition of additional regulations controls and duties and tariffs or changes to bilateral and regional trade agreements could result in lower sales volume which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

economic conditions around the world and in certain industries in which the company does business also impact sales price and volume as a result market uncertainty or an economic downturn driven by political tensions war terrorism epidemics pandemics or political instability in the geographic regions or industries in which the company sells its products could reduce demand for these products and result in decreased sales volume which could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

in addition volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit customers’ ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations which could result in a decrease in sales volume and have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations the company’s global business operations also give rise to market risk exposure 

related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices to manage such risks the company enters into hedging transactions pursuant to established guidelines and policies if the company fails to effectively manage such risks it could have a negative impact on its results of operations 

pension and other postretirement benefits increased obligations and expenses related to the companys defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations 

the company has defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans the “plans” in the united states and a number of other countries the assets of the companys funded plans are primarily invested in fixed income securities equity securities of us and foreign issuers and alternative investments including investments in real estate private equity and absolute return strategies changes in the market value of plan assets investment returns discount rates mortality rates regulations and the rate of increase in compensation levels may affect the funded status of the companys plans and could cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status of the plans a significant increase in the companys obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the companys financial condition 

supplydemand balance earnings generated by the companys products vary based in part on the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry 

the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry may be significantly impacted by the addition of new capacity especially for basic commodities where capacity is generally added in large increments as worldscale facilities are built this may disrupt industry balances and result in downward pressure on prices due to the increase in supply which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

legal and regulatory risks 

environmental compliance the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the companys financial results actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment climate change greenhouse gas emissions and the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials in addition the company may have costs related to environmental remediation and restoration obligations associated with past and current sites as well as related to its past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling although management will estimate and accrue liabilities for these obligations it is reasonably possible that the company’s ultimate cost with respect to these matters could be significantly higher which could negatively impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the company’s operations or require modifications to its facilities accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities for additional information see part ii item 7 other matters environmental matters in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

health and safety increased concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on the environment has resulted in more restrictive regulations and could lead to new regulations 

concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection these concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance and continued pressure for more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation these concerns could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of the companys products its reputation and the cost to comply with regulations in addition terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution these concerns could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

local state federal and foreign governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals which could result in higher operating costs 

litigation the company is party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to product liability patent infringement employment matters governmental tax and regulation disputes contract and commercial litigation and other actions 

certain of the claims and lawsuits facing the company purport to be class actions and seek damages in very large amounts all such claims are contested with the exception of the possible effect of the asbestosrelated liability of union carbide corporation “union carbide” and chapter 11 related matters of dow silicones corporation dow silicones as described below it is the opinion of the company’s management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestosrelated suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades at december 31 2020 union carbides total asbestosrelated liability including future defense and processing costs was 1098 million 1165 million at december 31 2019 

in 1995 dow silicones a former 5050 joint venture voluntarily filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in order to resolve breast implant liabilities and related matters the “chapter 11 proceeding” dow silicones emerged from the chapter 11 proceeding on june 1 2004 and is implementing the joint plan of reorganization the “plan” the plan provides funding for the resolution of breast implant and other product liability litigation covered by the chapter 11 proceeding dow silicones’ liability for breast implant and other product liability claims was 160 million at december 31 2020 165 million at december 31 2019 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on litigation matters 

plastic waste increased concerns regarding plastic waste in the environment consumers selectively reducing their consumption of plastic products due to recycling concerns or new or more restrictive regulations and rules related to plastic waste could reduce demand for the company’s plastic products and could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

local state federal and foreign governments have been increasingly proposing and in some cases approving bans on certain plasticbased products including singleuse plastics plastic straws and utensils in addition plastics have faced increased public scrutiny due to negative coverage of plastic waste in the environment including the world’s oceans as dow is one of the world’s largest producers of plastics increased regulation on the use of plastics could cause reduced demand for the company’s polyethylene products which could negatively impact the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

operational and strategic risks 

company strategy implementing certain elements of the companys strategy could negatively impact its financial results 

the company currently has manufacturing operations sales and marketing activities and joint ventures in emerging geographic regions activities in these geographic regions are accompanied by uncertainty and risks including navigating different government regulatory environments relationships with new local partners project funding commitments and guarantees expropriation military actions war terrorism and political instability sabotage uninsurable risks suppliers not performing as expected resulting in increased risk of extended project timelines and determining raw material supply and other details regarding product movement if the manufacturing operations sales and marketing activities andor implementation of these projects is not successful it could adversely affect the company’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

cyber threat the risk of loss of the company’s intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive business information or disruption of operations could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

cyberattacks or security breaches could compromise confidential business critical information cause a disruption in the company’s operations or harm the companys reputation the company has attractive information assets including intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business critical information while the company has a comprehensive cybersecurity program that is continuously reviewed maintained and upgraded a significant cyberattack could result in the loss of critical business information andor could negatively impact operations which could have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

goodwill an impairment of goodwill could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

at least annually the company assesses goodwill for impairment if testing indicates that goodwill is impaired the carrying value is written down based on fair value with a charge against earnings where the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology in determining fair value continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment accordingly any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill could negatively impact the companys results of operations see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the companys goodwill impairment testing 

operational event a significant operational event could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

as a diversified chemical manufacturing company the companys operations the transportation of products cyberattacks pandemics and other public healthrelated events or severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena such as freezing drought hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods etc could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations neighbors or the public at large which could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

major hurricanes have caused significant disruption in the companys operations on the us gulf coast logistics across the region and the supply of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of its products due to the companys substantial presence on the us gulf coast similar severe weather conditions or other natural phenomena in the future could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

raw materials availability of purchased feedstock and energy and the volatility of these costs impact dow’s operating costs and add variability to earnings 

purchased feedstock and energy costs account for a substantial portion of the company’s total production costs and operating expenses the company purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane propane butane naphtha and condensate as feedstocks and also purchases certain monomers primarily ethylene and propylene to supplement internal production as well as other raw materials the company also purchases natural gas primarily to generate electricity and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation 

feedstock and energy costs generally follow price trends in crude oil and natural gas which are sometimes volatile while the company uses its feedstock flexibility and financial and physical hedging programs to help mitigate feedstock cost increases the company is not always able to immediately raise selling prices ultimately the ability to pass on underlying cost increases is dependent on market conditions conversely when feedstock and energy costs decline selling prices generally decline as well as a result volatility in these costs could impact the company’s results of operations 

the company has a number of investments on the us gulf coast to take advantage of increasing supplies of lowcost natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls derived from shale gas including the st charles operations sco2 ethylene production facility which commenced operations in december 2012 an onpurpose propylene production facility which commenced operations in december 2015 an ethylene production facility in plaquemine louisiana which included expanding the facility’s ethylene production capacity and modifications to enable full ethane cracking flexibility completion of a new integrated worldscale ethylene production facility and a new elite™ enhanced polyethylene production facility both located in freeport texas in 2017 and a capacity expansion project which brought the facility’s total ethylene capacity to 2000 kilotonnes per annum in 2020 and the company commenced operations in 2018 on its new ldpe production facility and its new nordel™ metallocene epdm production facility both located in plaquemine louisiana as a result of these investments the company’s exposure to purchased ethylene and propylene is expected to decline offset by increased exposure to ethane and propanebased feedstocks 

while the company expects abundant and costadvantaged supplies of ngls in the united states to persist for the foreseeable future if ngls become significantly less advantaged than crude oilbased feedstocks it could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and future investments also if the company’s key suppliers of feedstock and energy are unable to provide the raw materials required for production it could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

separation from dowdupont risks related to achieving the anticipated benefits of dows separation from dowdupont 

risks related to achieving the anticipated benefits of dows separation from dowdupont include but are not limited to a number of conditions outside the control of dow including risks related to i dows inability to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expects to receive from the separation from dowdupont ii certain tax risks associated with the separation iii the failure of dows pro forma financial information to be a reliable indicator of dows future results iv dows inability to receive thirdparty consents required under the separation agreement v noncompete restrictions under the separation agreement vi receipt of less favorable terms in the commercial agreements dow entered into with dupont and corteva inc corteva including restrictions under intellectual property crosslicense agreements than dow would have received from an unaffiliated third party and vii dows obligation to indemnify dupont andor corteva for certain liabilities

the global regional and local spread of covid19 resulted in significant global mitigation measures including governmentdirected quarantines social distancing and shelterinplace mandates travel restrictions andor bans and restricted access to certain corporate facilities and manufacturing sites most of the company’s manufacturing facilities have been designated essential operations by local governments as a result nearly all of the company’s manufacturing sites and facilities continue to operate and are doing so safely having implemented social distancing and enhanced health safety and sanitization measures as directed by dows regional crisis management teams “cmts” the cmts continue to work closely with site leadership and are adjusting alert levels as warranted on a site by site basis

review of 2020 financial impacts from covid19 

net sales were 385 billion in 2020 down 10 percent from net sales of 430 billion in 2019 as the covid19 pandemic disrupted the global economy and supply and demand fundamentals the most significant impacts from the pandemic occurred in the first half of the year with a gradual yet uneven recovery taking hold as the second half of the year progressed 

in the first six months of 2020 the companys sales declined 18 percent compared with the same period last year with the most significant impact on demand in the second quarter of 2020 strong demand in food packaging health and hygiene home care and pharma endmarkets was more than offset by volume declines for products used in consumer durable good endmarkets including construction furniture and bedding and automotive with the most notable impacts in the industrial intermediates  infrastructure and performance materials  coatings operating segments demand for products used in consumer durable goods remained lower through the second quarter largely due to the delayed restart in these industries from may to june 

1 operating ebitda is a nongaap measure dow defines operating ebitda as earnings ie income loss from continuing operations before income taxes before interest depreciation and amortization excluding the impact of significant items 

local price declined in the first and second quarters of 2020 largely impacted by lower global energy prices in march and april 2020 crude oil prices declined significantly due in part to the covid19 pandemic coupled with increased supply from oil producers crude oil prices increased in the latter half of the second quarter as supply and demand fundamentals improved driving higher feedstock costs which proved beneficial to product prices and margins in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 

in the third quarter of 2020 net sales increased 16 percent compared with the second quarter of 2020 due to increasing demand and higher local prices sales increased sequentially in all operating segments and geographic regions reflecting improved demand trends in furniture and bedding appliances packaging construction and automotive endmarkets local price also increased sequentially reflecting higher global energy prices and improved supply and demand fundamentals with increases in all geographic regions local price increases were reported in packaging  specialty plastics and industrial intermediates  infrastructure which more than offset declines in performance materials  coatings operating rates increased from second quarter lows as the company raised rates to match demand trends as the global economic recovery gained traction the companys deliberate focus on structural cost reductions and prudent cash management resulted in sequentially higher margins and cash flow in the third quarter of 2020 

net sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 10 percent sequentially with continued demand recovery as the global economy continued to strengthen sales increased sequentially in all operating segments and geographic regions reflecting strong supply and demand fundamentals which drove both price and volume gains local price increased in all segments and all geographic regions volume increased in all geographic regions and in packaging  specialty plastics and industrial intermediates  infrastructure reflecting consumerdriven demand and industrial market recovery volume declined in performance materials  coatings primarily due to seasonal demand declines for coating applications operating rates continued to increase in the fourth quarter of 2020 and margins expanded 

notably net sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 increased 5 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 with increases in local price and volume local price increased 2 percent compared with the same quarter last year primarily driven by improved pricing in polyethylene and polyurethane applications volume returned to prepandemic levels in all operating segments and was led by demand growth in packaging  specialty plastics and performance materials  coatings 

the company enters 2021 with sequential momentum and is wellpositioned for continued profitable growth in the ongoing economic recovery and improving industry cycle the company will maintain its disciplined focus on capital allocation priorities as it benefits from an improving cost structure financial flexibility and a lowcost operating model as the market recovery broadens dow anticipates increasing margins as differentiated parts of the portfolio see improving demand longerterm the company expects to deliver ongoing significant value through increased innovation operational efficiencies and a leading environmental social and governance profile that will further distinguish dow from its peers

operating ebit was 314 million in 2020 down 66 percent from pro forma operating ebit of 918 million in 2019 operating ebit decreased primarily due to margin compression lower demand in siloxanes as a result of the covid19 pandemic and higher manufacturing and planned maintenance turnaround costs that more than offset volume gains in coatings  performance monomers and lower sga costs

outlook 

operating segments  endmarket expectations 

in 2021 the company expects continued volatility across crude oil natural gas and feedstocks driven by external macroeconomic and geopolitical factors including the continuation of an uneven recovery from the covid19 pandemic overall the company expects crude oil prices to be on average higher than 2020 with an expectation of firming prices in the second half of the year crude oil fundamentals suggest global supply will meet or slightly lag demand however the uneven pandemic recovery could slow demand leading to further volatility in prices 

the company expects natural gas prices to remain competitive the company expects the us  canada gas supply to continue to recover through 2021 robust supplies of natural gas are expected to keep domestic prices globally competitive us exports of liquefied natural gas lng are expected to remain strong in europe the supply of natural gas is expected to continue to be plentiful both from pipeline supply and from growing lng imports 

in packaging  specialty plastics the global economic recovery is expected to drive demand growth notably for flexible food and specialty packaging industrial and consumer packaging and functional polymers integrated margins are expected to improve supported by strong supply and demand fundamentals expected in the first half of the year and the company’s regional feedstock cost advantages profitability could vary materially particularly in the latter part of the year depending on supply and demand dynamics global gross domestic product gdp growth rates industry operating rates timing of new industry capacity startups and fluctuations in global crude oil natural gas and feedstock prices the hydrocarbons  energy business expects to bring online approximately 130000 metric tons of additional ethylene capacity in canada as part of its suite of incremental growth investments the new capacity is expected to come online in the first half of 2021 

in industrial intermediates  infrastructure above gdp top line growth is expected driven by strong demand for products used in furniture and bedding appliances automotive construction electronics and pharma applications prices are expected to increase for most products including continued recovery in monoethylene glycol pricing 

supply and demand fundamentals for methylene diphenyl diisocyanate and propylene oxide are expected to remain consistent with what was experienced in 2020 with additional industry capacity anticipated to come online in 2021 margins are also expected to improve driven by demand growth 

in performance materials  coatings prices for siloxanes are expected to improve compared with 2020 but remain below peak pricing that was seen in 2018 downstream silicones volume is expected to grow in excess of gdp particularly for products used in mobility and transportation high performance building and construction industrial and consumer and electronics applications the company will continue to pursue incremental downstream silicones capacity debottleneck and growth projects to meet expected demand in consumer driven endmarkets global architectural coatings and industrial coatings demand is anticipated to see continued recovery as the doityourself and retail endmarkets remain strong and contractor demand improves highly competitive environments in both architectural and industrial coatings are expected to continue but the company looks to capture opportunities from customers’ shift to sustainable chemistries where dow has unique technologies and solutions to compete 

other factors impacting operating segment profitability include 

• planned maintenance turnaround spending is expected to be approximately 400 million higher including joint ventures spending will be higher in the second and third quarters as the covid19 pandemic delayed certain planned maintenance turnaround activities in 2020

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us gaap requires management to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements following are the company’s accounting policies impacted by judgments assumptions and estimates 

litigation 

the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business including product liability patent infringement employment matters governmental tax and regulation disputes contract and commercial litigation and other actions the company routinely assesses the legal and factual circumstances of each matter the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses a determination of the amount of the reserves required if any for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known claim the company has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers covering various timeframes these policies may provide coverage that could be utilized to minimize the financial impact if any of certain contingencies the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter for further discussion see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation 

union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestosrelated suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestoscontaining products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining products located on union carbide’s premises and union carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary amchem products inc amchem each year ankura consulting group llc ankura performs a review for union carbide based upon historical asbestos claims resolution and asbestosrelated defense and processing costs through the terminal year of 2049 union carbide compares current asbestos claim and resolution activity including asbestosrelated defense and processing costs to the results of the most recent ankura study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the asbestosrelated liability continues to be appropriate 

for additional information see part i item 3 legal proceedings asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

the company determines the costs of environmental remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability and emerging remediation technologies the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available at december 31 2020 the company had accrued obligations of 1244 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs including 248 million for the remediation of superfund sites this is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately one and a half times that amount for further discussion see environmental matters in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

the company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level reporting units are the level at which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by business management on a regular basis the company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative andor quantitative testing procedures the separation from dowdupont on april 1 2019 did not impact the composition of the companys six reporting units coatings  performance monomers consumer solutions hydrocarbons  energy industrial solutions packaging and specialty plastics and polyurethanes  construction chemicals the ecp businesses received as part of the separation from dowdupont are included in the hydrocarbons  energy and packaging and specialty plastics reporting units at december 31 2020 goodwill was carried by five out of six of the companys reporting units 

the company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rates longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices equity and credit market activity discount rates foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and new product launches cost factors such as raw material prices and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value additional quantitative testing is required 

quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value if the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units this valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the companys reporting units however where market comparables are available the company includes ebitebitda multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis the discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions projected revenue growth rates or compounded annual growth rates discount rates tax rates terminal values currency exchange rates and forecasted longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices by geographic region and by year which include the companys key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil due to its correlation to naphtha currency exchange rates and longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices are established for the company as a whole and applied consistently to all reporting units while revenue growth rates discount rates and tax rates are established by reporting unit to account for differences in business fundamentals and industry risk these key assumptions drive projected ebitebitda and ebitebitda margins which are key elements of management’s internal control over the reporting unit valuation analysis 

2020 goodwill impairment testing 

in 2020 there were no events or changes in circumstances that warranted interim goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2020 qualitative testing was performed for all reporting units carrying goodwill based on the results of the qualitative testing quantitative testing was performed on one reporting unit for the qualitative assessments management considered factors at both the company level and the reporting unit level based on the qualitative assessments for the reporting units management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit for the quantitative testing the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled at december 31 2020 rate of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods the us pension plans represent 68 percent of the company’s pension plan assets and 69 percent of the pension obligations 

the company uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the us and other selected countries under the spot rate approach the company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual spot rates from the willis towers watson ratelink yield curve based on highquality corporate bond yields for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost service cost and interest cost for all other plans including all plans prior to adoption are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations 

the following information relates to the us plans only a similar approach is used for the company’s nonus plans 

the company determines the expected longterm rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the companys investment committee and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class the company’s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered the expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience the expected longterm rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year the weightedaverage longterm rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2020 was 795 percent the weightedaverage assumption to be used for determining 2021 net periodic pension expense is 796 percent future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company’s pension plans 

the discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the us qualified plans are based on the yield on highquality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date future expected actuarially determined cash flows for the company’s us plans are individually discounted at the spot rates under the willis towers watson us ratelink 6090 corporate yield curve based on 60th to 90th percentile highquality corporate bond yields to arrive at the plan’s obligations as of the measurement date the weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations decreased to 271 percent at december 31 2020 from 341 percent at december 31 2019 

at december 31 2020 the us qualified plans were underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis by 5873 million the underfunded amount increased 1105 million compared with december 31 2019 the increase in the underfunded amount in 2020 was primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates which was partially offset by overall favorable asset returns the company did not make contributions to the us qualified plans in 2020 

the assumption for the longterm rate for the compensation levels for the us qualified plans was unchanged the company uses a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations 

the following discussion relates to the company’s significant pension plans 

the company bases the determination of pension expense on a marketrelated valuation of plan assets that reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets since the marketrelated value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded over the life of the plans both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized at december 31 2020 net gains of 1396 million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of plan assets these net gains will result in decreases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the net increase in the marketrelated value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains is presented in the following table 



at december 31 2020 the company expects pension expense to decrease in 2021 by approximately 25 million the decrease in pension expense is primarily due to the lower interest cost component 

a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the longterm return on assets assumption would change the company’s total pension expense for 2021 by 61 million a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would lower the companys total pension expense for 2021 by 55 million a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the companys total pension expense for 2021 by 60 million a 25 basis point change in the longterm return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for 2021 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence both positive and negative the company recognizes future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 

at december 31 2020 the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of 1810 million after valuation allowances of 1302 million 

in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets the company relies on in order of increasing subjectivity taxable income in prior carryback years the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results 

at december 31 2020 the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of 2004 million 708 million of which is subject to expiration in the years 2021 through 2025 in order to realize these deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards the company needs taxable income of approximately 27331 million across multiple jurisdictions the taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration from 2021 through 2025 is approximately 6405 million 

the company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination at december 31 2020 the company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of 373 million 

the company accrues for nonincome tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated at december 31 2020 the company had a nonincome tax contingency reserve for both domestic and foreign issues of 33 million 

indemnification assets and liabilities 

in connection with the 2019 separation from dowdupont and the 2016 ownership restructure of dow silicones dow entered into agreements that established each party’s indemnification obligations for certain tax environmental litigation and other matters subject to certain conditions and limits the company records indemnification assets when collection is deemed probable and engages with indemnifying parties and assesses publicly available information to evaluate collectability the underlying tax environmental litigation and other liabilities for which the company claims indemnification are subject to significant judgment and potential disputes could adversely impact collectability the company assesses the collectability of indemnification assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable at december 31 2020 indemnification assets were 225 million and 115 million for dow inc and tdcc respectively 210 million and 100 million for dow inc and tdcc respectively at december 31 2019 

the company records indemnification liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated at december 31 2020 indemnification liabilities related to the agreements were 657 million for dow inc and zero for tdcc 848 million for dow inc and zero for tdcc at december 31 2019 this represents management’s best estimate of the company’s obligations under the agreements although it is reasonably possible that future events could cause the actual values to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded for further discussion see notes 3 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

environmental policies 

dow is committed to worldclass environmental health and safety “ehs” performance as demonstrated by industryleading performance a longstanding commitment to responsible care® and a strong commitment to achieve the companys 2025 sustainability goals – goals that set the standard for sustainability in the chemical industry by focusing on improvements in the company’s local corporate citizenship and product stewardship and by actively pursuing methods to reduce its environmental impact 

to meet the company’s public commitments as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject the company has welldefined policies requirements and management systems the companys ehs management system “ems” defines the “who what when and how” needed for the businesses to achieve the company’s policies requirements performance objectives leadership expectations and public commitments to ensure effective utilization the ems is integrated into a companywide management system for ehs operations quality and human resources 

it is the companys policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment first work to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research process design plant operations and maintenance second find ways to reuse and recycle materials finally unusable or nonrecyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste treatment may include destruction by chemical physical biological or thermal means disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated the company has specific requirements for waste that is transferred to nondow facilities including the periodic auditing of these facilities 

the company believes thirdparty verification and transparent public reporting are cornerstones of worldclass ehs performance and building public trust numerous dow sites in europe latin america asia pacific and the us  canada have received thirdparty verification of the company’s compliance with responsible care® and with outside specifications such as iso14001 the company continues to be a global champion of responsible care® and has worked to broaden the application and impact of responsible care® around the world through engagement with suppliers customers and joint venture partners

chemical security 

public and political attention continues to be placed on the protection of critical infrastructure including the chemical industry from security threats terrorist attacks natural disasters and cyber incidents have increased global concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution many including the company and the american chemistry council have called for uniform riskbased and performancebased national standards for securing the us chemical industry us regulations set forth riskbased and performancebased standards that must be met at us coast guardregulated facilities the company is subject to us chemical plant security regulations and chemical facility antiterrorism standards which were implemented by the us department of homeland security the company is also subject to the requirements of the rail transportation security rule issued by the us transportation security administration the company continues to support uniform riskbased national standards for securing the chemical industry 

since 1988 the company has maintained a comprehensive multilevel security plan that focuses on security emergency planning preparedness and response this plan which has been activated in response to significant world and national events is reviewed on an annual basis the company continues to improve its security plans placing emphasis on the safety of dow communities and people by being prepared to meet risks at any level and to address both internal and external identifiable risks the security plan includes regular vulnerability assessments security audits mitigation efforts and physical security upgrades designed to reduce vulnerability the company’s security plans are also designed to avert interruptions of normal business operations that could materially and adversely affect the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the company played a key role in the development and implementation of the american chemistry council’s responsible care® security code security code which requires that all aspects of security – including facility transportation and cyberspace – be assessed and gaps addressed through the global implementation of the security code the company has permanently heightened the level of security – not just in the united states but worldwide the company employs several hundred employees and contractors in its emergency services and security department worldwide in 2019 the company established its global security operations center gsoc to provide 24hourday 365dayyear realtime monitoring of global risks to dow assets and people the gsoc employs stateoftheart social media monitoring threat reporting and geofencing capabilities to analyze global risks and report those risks facilitating decisionmaking and actions to prevent dow crises 

through the implementation of the security code including voluntary security enhancements and upgrades the company is wellpositioned to comply with us chemical facility regulations and other regulatory security frameworks the company participates with the american chemistry council to periodically review and update the security code 

the company continues to work collaboratively across the supply chain on responsible care® supply chain design emergency preparedness shipment visibility and transportation of hazardous materials the company cooperated with public and private entities to lead the implementation of advanced tank car design and track and trace technologies further the company’s distribution risk review process addresses potential threats in all modes of transportation across the company’s supply chain to reduce vulnerabilities the company maintains security measures that meet or exceed regulatory and industry security standards in all areas in which they operate 

the companys initiatives relative to chemical security emergency preparedness and response community awareness and emergency responses and crisis management are implemented consistently at all dow sites on a global basis the company participates with chemical associations globally and participates as an active member of the us delegation to the g7 global partnership subworking group on chemical security 

climate change 

climate change matters for the company are likely to be driven by several categories of risks related to the transition to a lowercarbon economy “transition risks” and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change “physical risks” 

transition risks 

transition risks include carbon pricing mechanisms transition to lower emissions technology increased cost of raw materials and mandates on and regulation of existing products and services carbon pricing is a marketbased strategy for lowering global warming emissions by putting a monetary value on carbon emissions allowing for the costs of climate impacts and opportunities for lowcarbon energy options to be reflected in production and consumption choices approximately 35 percent of dow’s carbon emissions are generated from operations in canada and the european union “eu” where carbon pricing is already in place as part of the european green deal the european commission proposed a 2030 greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions reduction target of at least 55 percent below 1990 levels with a goal for the eu to be carbon neutral by 2050 in china an emissions trading system initially proposed to cover the power sector only is expected to gradually expand to cover a total of eight sectors including the petrochemical and chemical industries though no specific timeline for implementation and expansion has been outlined 

these carbon pricing mechanisms will not only increase dow’s direct costs to operate but will also result in increased energy costs dow mitigates the direct cost impact of existing regulation through research and development projects designed to increase energy efficiency and capital investment projects that will reduce the company’s energy usage and carbon footprint the company is also exploring options for carbon capture utilization and storage “ccus” and electrification of dow’s processes dow sees ccus as a mechanism to help bridge the time period between the onset of increased carbon regulation and the technology available to economically reduce dow’s ghg emissions dow also incorporates a theoretical internal carbon price into its business planning and risk management strategies this theoretical price of carbon is also included in internal calculations used for prioritizing capital projects ultimately the goal of utilizing an internal carbon price is to mitigate the risk of dow’s carbon exposure to help ensure future resiliency 

physical risks 

operationally climate change may result in more frequent severe weather events potential changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns which can disrupt operations several of dow’s production facilities are located in waterscarce areas and water shortages could impact normal production changes in average precipitation could have an impact on the availability and price of water the company has engineered susceptible facilities particularly on the us gulf coast to better withstand severe weather and rising sea levels and continues to study the longterm implications of changing climate parameters on water availability plant siting issues and other impacts preparedness plans are developed that detail actions needed in the event of severe weather these measures have historically been in place and these activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness 

in 2019 the most recent period for which data is available the company’s greenhouse gas intensity was down approximately 3 percent from 2018 and by a total of approximately 13 percent since the baseline year of 2006 in addition the company is on track to meet its target of purchasing 750 megawatts of renewable power by 2025 

the company continues progress toward its defined 2025 sustainability goals and is taking further action to lessen its carbon impact moving forward in june 2020 the company announced a new multidecade carbon target to reduce its net annual carbon emission by 5 million metric tons compared with its 2020 baseline a reduction of approximately 15 percent and an intention to be carbon neutral scopes 123 as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol plus product benefits by 2050 

dow’s action plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 includes 

• optimizing energy efficiency of facilities and processes 

• increasing renewables in purchased power mix 

• investments in ccus 

• developing lowcarbon technologies for emission reductions 

• deploying materials to enable emissions reductions for customers and industries 

the company intends to meet its commitment to implement the recommendations of the task force on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd over the next two years disclosures aligned with tcfd recommendations will be included in the company’s annual sustainability report 

environmental remediation 

the company accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and regulatory requirements the nature of such remediation can include management of soil and groundwater contamination the accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements to assess the impact on the financial statements environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability and the ability to apply remediation technologies these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available the company had an accrued liability of 996 million at december 31 2020 related to the remediation of current or former dowowned sites at december 31 2019 the liability related to remediation was 948 million 

in addition to current and former dowowned sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and equivalent state laws hereafter referred to collectively as superfund law the company is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where the company allegedly disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances because superfund law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site the company has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that have also been named potentially responsible parties “prps” at each site the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share the company’s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites was 248 million at december 31 2020 207 million at december 31 2019 the company has not recorded any thirdparty recovery related to these sites as a receivable 

information regarding environmental sites is provided below 



1 dowowned sites are sites currently or formerly owned by the company in the united states remediation obligations are imposed by the resource conservation and recovery act or analogous state law at december 31 2020 24 of these sites 28 sites at december 31 2019 were formerly owned by dowell schlumberger inc a group of companies in which the company previously owned a 50 percent interest the company sold its interest in dowell schlumberger in 1992 

2 superfund sites are sites including sites not owned by the company where remediation obligations are imposed by superfund law 

additional information is provided below for the company’s midland michigan manufacturing site and midland offsite locations collectively the midland sites as well as a superfund site in woodridge new jersey the locations for which the company has the largest potential environmental liabilities 

in the early days of operations at the midland manufacturing site wastes were usually disposed of onsite resulting in soil and groundwater contamination which has been contained and managed onsite under a series of resource conservation and recovery act permits and regulatory agreements  the hazardous waste operating license for the midland manufacturing site issued in 2003 and renewed and replaced in september 2015 also included provisions for the company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of offsite contamination from historic midland manufacturing site operations in january 2010 the company the us environmental protection agency epa and the state of michigan state entered into an administrative order on consent that requires the company to conduct a remedial investigation a feasibility study and a remedial design for the tittabawassee river the saginaw river and the saginaw bay and pay the oversight costs of the epa and the state under the authority of cercla see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to midland offsite environmental matters 

rohm and haas a wholly owned subsidiary of the company is a prp at the woodridge new jersey ventronvelsicol superfund site and the adjacent berry’s creek study area bcsa collectively the woodridge sites rohm and haas is a successor in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments in 2018 the berry’s creek study area potentially responsible party group “prp group” consisting of over 100 prps completed a remedial investigationfeasibility study for the bcsa during that time the epa concluded that an “iterative or adaptive approach” was appropriate for cleaning up the bcsa thus each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work in september 2018 the epa signed a record of decision rod 1 which describes the initial phase of the epa’s plan to cleanup the bcsa rod 1 will remediate waterways and major tributaries in the most contaminated part of the bcsa the prp group has signed agreements with the epa to design the selected remedy although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the bcsa and rohm and haass share of these costs has yet to be determined the range of activities that are required in the interim record of decision is known in general terms 

at december 31 2020 the company had accrued liabilities totaling 370 million 368 million at december 31 2019 for environmental remediation at the midland and woodridge sites in 2020 the company spent 53 million 32 million in 2019 for environmental remediation at the midland and woodridge sites 

during the third quarter of 2020 the company accrued additional liabilities totaling 106 million related to environmental remediation matters resulting from the companys evaluation of the costs required to manage remediation activities at sites dow will permanently shut down as part of its 2020 restructuring program in addition the company recorded indemnification assets of 50 million related to dow silicones environmental matters net of indemnifications the company recognized a pretax charge of 56 million related to these environmental matters included in restructuring goodwill impairment and asset related charges  net in the consolidated statements of income 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company accrued additional liabilities totaling 447 million related to environmental remediation matters at a number of current and historical locations the additional accrual primarily resulted from the culmination of longstanding negotiations and discussions with regulators and agencies including technical studies supporting higher cost estimates for final or staged remediation plans the company’s evaluation of the cost required to manage remediation activities at sites affected by dow’s separation from dowdupont and related agreements with corteva and dupont and the company’s review of its closure strategies and obligations to monitor ongoing operations and maintenance activities in addition the company recorded indemnification assets of 48 million related to dow silicones’ environmental matters net of indemnifications the company recognized a pretax charge of 399 million related to these environmental matters included in “cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income 

in total the company’s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was 1244 million at december 31 2020 compared with 1155 million at december 31 2019 this is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately one and a half times that amount consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled 234 million in 2020 588 million in 2019 and 176 million in 2018 the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to operating the companys current pollution abatement facilities excluding internal recharges totaled 616 million in 2020 677 million in 2019 and 695 million in 2018 capital expenditures for environmental protection were 80 million in 2020 83 million in 2019 and 55 million in 2018 

asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation 

union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestosrelated suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestoscontaining products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining products located on union carbide’s premises and union carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary amchem in many cases plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide’s products 

the table below provides information regarding asbestosrelated claims pending against union carbide and amchem based on criteria developed by union carbide and its external consultants 



plaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants as a result the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to union carbide amchem or any other particular defendant even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury in fact there are no asbestos personal injury cases in which only union carbide andor amchem are the sole named defendants for these reasons and based upon union carbide’s litigation and settlement experience union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestosrelated liability

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

the company’s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices to manage such risks effectively the company enters into hedging transactions pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities where appropriate a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional nonspecific exposure within established limits and policies derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company’s results 

the global nature of the company’s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets the company has assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of the company’s foreign currency risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows to achieve this objective the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts overthecounter option contracts crosscurrency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies exposures primarily relate to assets liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies as well as economic exposure which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities the largest exposures are denominated in european currencies the chinese yuan the japanese yen and the thai baht although exposures also exist in other currencies in asia pacific latin america the middle east africa india and canada 

the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile to achieve this objective the company hedges using interest rate swaps “swaptions” and exchangetraded instruments the company’s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 

the company has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company’s market risk policies and procedures 

inherent in the company’s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments natural gas and crude oil along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production constitute the main commodity exposures overthecounter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 

the company uses valueatrisk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels the var methodology used by the company is a variancecovariance model this model uses a 975 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data the 2020 and 2019 yearend and average daily var for the aggregate of all positions are shown below these amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the company 



the company’s composite var for the aggregate of all positions increased from 137 million at december 31 2019 to 194 million at december 31 2020 the commodities var increased due to an increase in managed exposures and an increase in commodity volatility the equity securities var increased due to an increase in equity volatility the foreign exchange var decreased due to a decrease in managed exposures the interest rate var increased due to an increase in interest rate volatility and an increase in interest rate exposure see note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding market risk

 item 1a risk factors 

the factors described below represent the companys principal risks 

global economic considerations the company operates in a global competitive environment which gives rise to operating and market risk exposure 

the company sells its broad range of products and services in a competitive global environment and competes worldwide for sales on the basis of product quality price technology and customer service increased levels of competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volume which could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations sales of the companys products are also subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws and regulations trade agreements import and export controls and duties and tariffs the imposition of additional regulations controls and duties and tariffs or changes to bilateral and regional trade agreements could result in lower sales volume which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

economic conditions around the world and in certain industries in which the company does business also impact sales price and volume as a result market uncertainty or an economic downturn driven by political tensions war terrorism epidemics or political instability in the geographic regions or industries in which the company sells its products could reduce demand for these products and result in decreased sales volume which could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

in addition volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit customers’ ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations which could result in a decrease in sales volume and have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations the company’s global business operations also give rise to market risk exposure related to changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices to manage such risks the company enters into hedging transactions pursuant to established guidelines and policies if the company fails to effectively manage such risks it could have a negative impact on its results of operations 

financial commitments and credit markets market conditions could reduce the companys flexibility to respond to changing business conditions or fund capital needs 

adverse economic conditions could reduce the company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs the economic environment could result in a contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace and reduce sources of liquidity for the company this could result in higher borrowing costs 

raw materials availability of purchased feedstock and energy and the volatility of these costs impact dow’s operating costs and add variability to earnings 

purchased feedstock and energy costs account for a substantial portion of the company’s total production costs and operating expenses the company purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane propane butane naphtha and condensate as feedstocks and also purchases certain monomers primarily ethylene and propylene to supplement internal production as well as other raw materials the company also purchases natural gas primarily to generate electricity and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation 

feedstock and energy costs generally follow price trends in crude oil and natural gas which are sometimes volatile while the company uses its feedstock flexibility and financial and physical hedging programs to help mitigate feedstock cost increases the company is not always able to immediately raise selling prices ultimately the ability to pass on underlying cost increases is dependent on market conditions conversely when feedstock and energy costs decline selling prices generally decline as well as a result volatility in these costs could impact the company’s results of operations 

the company has a number of investments on the us gulf coast to take advantage of increasing supplies of lowcost natural gas and ngls derived from shale gas including the st charles operations sco2 ethylene production facility in december 2012 an onpurpose propylene production facility which commenced operations in december 2015 an ethylene production facility in plaquemine louisiana which included expanding the facility’s ethylene production capacity and modifications to enable full ethane cracking flexibility completion of a new integrated worldscale ethylene production facility and a new elite™ enhanced polyethylene production facility both located in freeport texas in 2017 and a capacity expansion project which will bring the facility’s total ethylene capacity to 2000 kta in 2020 and the company commenced operations in 2018 on its new ldpe production facility and its new nordel™ metallocene epdm production facility both located in plaquemine louisiana as a result of these investments the company’s exposure to purchased ethylene and propylene is expected to decline offset by increased exposure to ethane and propanebased feedstocks 

while the company expects abundant and costadvantaged supplies of ngls in the united states to persist for the foreseeable future if ngls become significantly less advantaged than crude oilbased feedstocks it could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations and future investments also if the company’s key suppliers of feedstocks and energy are unable to provide the raw materials required for production it could have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

supplydemand balance earnings generated by the companys products vary based in part on the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry 

the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry may be significantly impacted by the addition of new capacity especially for basic commodities where capacity is generally added in large increments as worldscale facilities are built this may disrupt industry balances and result in downward pressure on prices due to the increase in supply which could negatively impact the company’s results of operations 

litigation the company is party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to product liability patent infringement employment matters governmental tax and regulation disputes contract and commercial litigation and other actions 

certain of the claims and lawsuits facing the company purport to be class actions and seek damages in very large amounts all such claims are contested with the exception of the possible effect of the asbestosrelated liability of union carbide corporation “union carbide” and chapter 11 related matters of dow silicones corporation “dow silicones” formerly known as dow corning corporation which changed its name effective as of february 1 2018 as described below it is the opinion of the company’s management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestosrelated suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades at december 31 2019  union carbides total asbestosrelated liability including future defense and processing costs was 1165 million  1260 million at december 31 2018  

in 1995 dow silicones a former 5050 joint venture voluntarily filed for protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code in order to resolve breast implant liabilities and related matters the “chapter 11 proceeding” dow silicones emerged from the chapter 11 proceeding on june 1 2004 and is implementing the joint plan of reorganization the “plan” the plan provides funding for the resolution of breast implant and other product liability litigation covered by the chapter 11 proceeding dow silicones’ liability for breast implant and other product liability claims was 165 million at december 31 2019  263 million at december 31 2018  

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

environmental compliance the costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the companys financial results actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations substantial civil or criminal sanctions as well as the assessment of strict liability andor joint and several liability 

the company is subject to extensive federal state local and foreign laws regulations rules and ordinances relating to pollution protection of the environment greenhouse gas emissions and the generation storage handling transportation treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials in addition the company may have costs related to environmental remediation and restoration obligations associated with past and current sites as well as related to its past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling although management will estimate and accrue liabilities for these obligations it is reasonably possible that the company’s ultimate cost with respect to these matters could be significantly higher which could negatively impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements moreover changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the company’s operations or require modifications to its facilities accordingly environmental health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities 

health and safety increased concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on the environment has resulted in more restrictive regulations and could lead to new regulations 

concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection these concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals preferred purchasing delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals delayed product launches lack of market acceptance and continued pressure for more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation these concerns could also influence public perceptions the viability or continued sales of certain of the companys products its reputation and the cost to comply with regulations in addition terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution these concerns could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

local state federal and foreign governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals which could result in higher operating costs 

plastic waste increased concerns regarding plastic waste in the environment consumers selectively reducing their consumption of plastic products due to recycling concerns or new or more restrictive regulations and rules related to plastic waste could reduce demand for the company’s plastic products and could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

local state federal and foreign governments have been increasingly proposing and in some cases approving bans on certain plasticbased products including singleuse plastics plastic straws and utensils in addition plastics have faced increased public scrutiny due to negative coverage of plastic waste in the environment including the world’s oceans as dow is one of the world’s largest producers of plastics increased regulation on the use of plastics could cause reduced demand for the company’s polyethylene products which could negatively impact the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

operational event a significant operational event could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

as a diversified chemical manufacturing company the companys operations the transportation of products cyberattacks or severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena such as freezing drought hurricanes earthquakes tsunamis floods etc could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations neighbors or the public at large which could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations 

major hurricanes have caused significant disruption in the companys operations on the us gulf coast logistics across the region and the supply of certain raw materials which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of its products due to the companys substantial presence on the us gulf coast similar severe weather conditions or other natural phenomena in the future could negatively impact the companys results of operations 

cyber threat the risk of loss of the company’s intellectual property trade secrets or other sensitive business information or disruption of operations could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

cyberattacks or security breaches could compromise confidential business critical information cause a disruption in the company’s operations or harm the companys reputation the company has attractive information assets including intellectual property trade secrets and other sensitive business critical information while the company has a comprehensive cybersecurity program that is continuously reviewed maintained and upgraded a significant cyberattack could result in the loss of critical business information andor could negatively impact operations which could have a negative impact on the company’s financial results 

company strategy implementing certain elements of the companys strategy could negatively impact its financial results 

the company currently has manufacturing operations sales and marketing activities and joint ventures in emerging geographies activities in these geographic regions are accompanied by uncertainty and risks including navigating different government regulatory environments relationships with new local partners project funding commitments and guarantees expropriation military actions war terrorism and political instability sabotage uninsurable risks suppliers not performing as expected resulting in increased risk of extended project timelines and determining raw material supply and other details regarding product movement if the manufacturing operations sales and marketing activities andor implementation of these projects is not successful it could adversely affect the company’s financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

goodwill an impairment of goodwill could negatively impact the company’s financial results 

at least annually the company assesses goodwill for impairment if testing indicates that goodwill is impaired the carrying value is written down based on fair value with a charge against earnings where the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology in determining fair value continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment accordingly any determination requiring the writeoff of a significant portion of goodwill could negatively impact the companys results of operations see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the companys goodwill impairment testing 

pension and other postretirement benefits increased obligations and expenses related to the companys defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations 

the company has defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans the “plans” in the united states and a number of other countries the assets of the companys funded plans are primarily invested in fixed income securities equity securities of us and foreign issuers and alternative investments including investments in real estate private market securities and absolute return strategies changes in the market value of plan assets investment returns discount rates mortality rates regulations and the rate of increase in compensation levels may affect the funded status of the companys plans and could cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status of the plans a significant increase in the companys obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the companys results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the companys financial condition

debt 

as the company continues to maintain its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility management is focused on net debt a nongaap financial measure as the company believes this is the best representation of its financial leverage at this point in time as shown in the following table net debt is equal to total gross debt minus cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december 31 2019  net debt as a percent of total capitalization for dow inc and tdcc increased to 509 percent and 496 percent respectively compared with 337 percent for both companies at december 31 2018  the increase is primarily due to a reduction in stockholders equity for both companies as a result of the separation from dowdupont and a net loss in 2019 which was partially offset by a decrease in debt 



in 2019 the company issued 2 billion of senior unsecured notes in an offering under rule 144a of the securities act of 1933 the offering included 750 million aggregate principal amount of 480 percent notes due 2049 750 million aggregate principal amount of 3625 percent notes due 2026 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 315 percent notes due 2024 in addition the company redeemed 15 billion of 425 percent notes issued by the company with maturity in 2020 and 125 billion of 4125 percent notes issued by the company with maturity in 2021

the company may at any time repurchase certain debt securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to the applicable terms under which any such debt securities were issued certain internal approvals of the company and applicable laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction in which any such potential transactions might take place this in no way obligates the company to make any such repurchases nor should it be considered an offer to do so 

tdcc’s public debt instruments and primary private credit agreements contain among other provisions certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions tdcc’s most significant debt covenant with regard to its financial position is the obligation to maintain the ratio of its consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than 065 to 100 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the five year competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement revolving credit agreement equals or exceeds 500 million the ratio of tdcc’s consolidated indebtedness as defined in the revolving credit agreement was 051 to 100 at december 31 2019  management believes tdcc was in compliance with all of its covenants and default provisions at december 31 2019  

on april 1 2019 dowdupont completed the separation of its materials science business and dow inc became the direct parent company of tdcc in conjunction with the separation dow inc is obligated substantially concurrently with the issuance of any guarantee in respect of outstanding or committed indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement to enter into a supplemental indenture with tdcc and the trustee under tdcc’s existing 2008 base indenture governing certain notes issued by tdcc under such supplemental indenture dow inc will guarantee all outstanding debt securities and all amounts due under such existing base indenture and will become subject to certain covenants and events of default under the existing base indenture 

in addition the revolving credit agreement includes an event of default which would be triggered in the event dow inc incurs or guarantees third party indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of 250 million or engages in any material activity or directly owns any material assets in each case subject to certain conditions and exceptions dow inc may at its option cure the event of default by delivering an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the administrative agent within thirty days of the event or events giving rise to such event of default 

no such events have occurred or have been triggered at the time of the filing of this annual report on form 10k see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to tdcc’s notes payable and longterm debt activity and information on tdcc’s covenants and default provisions 

management expects that the company will continue to have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet all of its business obligations

quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value if the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference the company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units this valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the companys reporting units however where market comparables are available the company includes ebitebitda multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis the discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions projected revenue growth rates or compounded annual growth rates discount rates tax rates terminal values currency exchange rates and forecasted longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices by geographic region and by year which include the companys key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil due to its correlation to naphtha currency exchange rates and longterm hydrocarbon and energy prices are established for the company as a whole and applied consistently to all reporting units while revenue growth rates discount rates and tax rates are established by reporting unit to account for differences in business fundamentals and industry risk these key assumptions drive projected ebitebitda and ebitebitda margins which are key elements of management’s internal control over the reporting unit valuation analysis 

2019 goodwill impairment testing 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 quantitative testing was performed on two reporting units and a qualitative assessment was performed for the remaining reporting units for the qualitative assessments management considered the factors at both the company level and the reporting unit level based on the qualitative assessment management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit 

upon completion of the quantitative testing in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company determined the coatings  performance monomers cpm reporting unit was impaired during 2019 the cpm reporting unit did not consistently meet expected financial performance targets primarily due to the industry’s increased captive use of coatings products which led to volume reductions reduced margins for products across the portfolio due to changes in customer buying patterns and supply and demand balances as well as a continued trend of customer consolidation in end markets which reduced growth opportunities as a result the cpm reporting unit lowered its future revenue and profitability projections which were used in determining the fair value of the cpm reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology these discounted cash flows did not support the carrying value of the cpm reporting unit as a result the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 1039 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 the cpm reporting unit did not carry a goodwill balance at december 31 2019 the fair value of the other reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no other goodwill impairments were identified as a result of the 2019 testing 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

as a result of the company’s separation from dowdupont the number of defined benefit pension plans administered by the company decreased from 45 plans to 35 plans with approximately 270 million of net unfunded pension liabilities transferring to dowdupont plans administered by other subsidiaries of dowdupont that were transferred to the company were not significant there were no changes in the number of other postretirement benefit plans administered by the company as a result of the separation 

the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled at december 31 2019  rate of increase in future compensation levels mortality rates and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods the us pension plans represent 71 percent of the company’s pension plan assets and 70 percent of the pension obligations 

the company uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the us and other selected countries under the spot rate approach the company calculates service costs and interest costs by applying individual spot rates from the willis towers watson ratelink yield curve based on highquality corporate bond yields for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost service cost and interest cost for all other plans including all plans prior to adoption are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations 

the following information relates to the us plans only a similar approach is used for the company’s nonus plans 

the company determines the expected longterm rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the companys investment committee and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class the company’s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered the expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience the expected longterm rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year the weightedaverage longterm rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2019 was 792 percent the weightedaverage assumption to be used for determining 2020 net periodic pension expense is 795 percent future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company’s pension plans 

the discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the us qualified plans are based on the yield on highquality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date future expected actuarially determined cash flows for the company’s us plans are individually discounted at the spot rates under the willis towers watson us ratelink 6090 corporate yield curve based on 60th to 90th percentile highquality corporate bond yields to arrive at the plan’s obligations as of the measurement date the weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations decreased to 341 percent at december 31 2019  from 439 percent at december 31 2018  

at december 31 2019  the us qualified plans were underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis by 4768 million the underfunded amount increased 702 million compared with december 31 2018  the increase in the underfunded amount in 2019 was primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates which was partially offset by the reduction in the number of active us pension plan participants after the companys separation from dowdupont the company did not make contributions to the us qualified plans in 2019  

the assumption for the longterm rate for the compensation levels for the us qualified plans was unchanged the company uses a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations 

the following discussion relates to the company’s significant pension plans 

the company bases the determination of pension expense on a marketrelated valuation of plan assets that reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets since the marketrelated value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyear period the future value will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded over the life of the plans both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized at december 31 2019  net gains of 566 million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the marketrelated value of plan assets these net gains will result in decreases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the marketrelated value of assets 

the net increase in the marketrelated value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains losses is presented in the following table 



at december 31 2019  the company expects pension expense from continuing operations to increase in 2020 by approximately 125 million  the increase in pension expense is primarily due to the decrease in discount rates and curtailment gains of 27 million recognized in 2019 that are not expected to recur in 2020  

a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the longterm return on assets assumption would change the company’s total pension expense for 2020 by 59 million a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would lower the companys total pension expense for 2020 by 54 million a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the companys total pension expense for 2020 by 56 million a 25 basis point change in the longterm return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for 2020  

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence both positive and negative the company recognizes future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 

at december 31 2019  the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of 1866 million  after valuation allowances of 1262 million  

in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets the company relies on in order of increasing subjectivity taxable income in prior carryback years the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results 

at december 31 2019  the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of 1920 million  295 million of which is subject to expiration in the years 2020 through 2024  in order to realize these deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards the company needs taxable income of approximately 27010 million across multiple jurisdictions the taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration between 2020 through 2024 is approximately 3388 million  

the company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination at december 31 2019  the company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of 319 million  

the company accrues for nonincome tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated at december 31 2019  the company had a nonincome tax contingency reserve for both domestic and foreign issues of 44 million  

indemnification assets and liabilities 

in connection with the 2019 separation from dowdupont and the 2016 ownership restructure of dow silicones dow entered into agreements that established each party’s indemnification obligations for certain tax environmental litigation and other matters subject to certain conditions and limits the company records indemnification assets when collection is deemed probable and engages with indemnifying parties and assesses publicly available information to evaluate collectability the underlying tax environmental litigation and other liabilities for which the company claims indemnification are subject to significant judgment and potential disputes could adversely impact collectability the company assesses the collectability of indemnification assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable at december 31 2019 indemnification assets were 210 million and 100 million for dow inc and tdcc respectively zero for both at december 31 2018 

the company records indemnification liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated at december 31 2019 indemnification liabilities related to the agreements were 848 million for dow inc and zero for tdcc zero for both at december 31 2018 this represents management’s best estimate of the company’s obligations under the agreements although it is reasonably possible that future events could cause the actual values to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded for further discussion see notes 4 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

environmental policies 

dow is committed to worldclass environmental health and safety “ehs” performance as demonstrated by industryleading performance a longstanding commitment to responsible care® and a strong commitment to achieve the companys 2025 sustainability goals – goals that set the standard for sustainability in the chemical industry by focusing on improvements in the company’s local corporate citizenship and product stewardship and by actively pursuing methods to reduce its environmental impact 

to meet the company’s public commitments as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject the company has welldefined policies requirements and management systems the companys ehs management system “ems” defines the “who what when and how” needed for the businesses to achieve the company’s policies requirements performance objectives leadership expectations and public commitments to ensure effective utilization the ems is integrated into a companywide management system for ehs operations quality and human resources 

it is the companys policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment first work to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research process design plant operations and maintenance second find ways to reuse and recycle materials finally unusable or nonrecyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste treatment may include destruction by chemical physical biological or thermal means disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated the company has specific requirements for waste that is transferred to nondow facilities including the periodic auditing of these facilities 

the company believes thirdparty verification and transparent public reporting are cornerstones of worldclass ehs performance and building public trust numerous dow sites in europe latin america asia pacific and us  canada have received thirdparty verification of the company’s compliance with responsible care® and with outside specifications such as iso14001 the company continues to be a global champion of responsible care® and has worked to broaden the application and impact of responsible care® around the world through engagement with suppliers customers and joint venture partners

chemical security 

public and political attention continues to be placed on the protection of critical infrastructure including the chemical industry from security threats terrorist attacks natural disasters and cyber incidents have increased concern about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution many including the company and the american chemistry council have called for uniform riskbased and performancebased national standards for securing the us chemical industry the maritime transportation security act of 2002 and its regulations further set forth riskbased and performancebased standards that must be met at us coast guardregulated facilities us chemical plant security legislation was passed in 2006 and the department of homeland security is now implementing the regulations known as the chemical facility antiterrorism standards the company is complying with the requirements of the rail transportation security rule issued by the us transportation security administration the company continues to support uniform riskbased national standards for securing the chemical industry 

the focus on security emergency planning preparedness and response is not new to the company a comprehensive multilevel security plan has been maintained since 1988 this plan which has been activated in response to significant world and national events since then is reviewed on an annual basis the company continues to improve its security plans placing emphasis on the safety of dow communities and people by being prepared to meet risks at any level and to address both internal and external identifiable risks the security plan includes regular vulnerability assessments security audits mitigation efforts and physical security upgrades designed to reduce vulnerability the company’s security plans also are developed to avert interruptions of normal business operations that could materially and adversely affect the company’s results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

the company played a key role in the development and implementation of the american chemistry council’s responsible care® security code security code which requires that all aspects of security – including facility transportation and cyberspace – be assessed and gaps addressed through the global implementation of the security code the company has permanently heightened the level of security – not just in the us but worldwide the company employs several hundred employees and contractors in its emergency services and security department worldwide in 2019 the company established its global security operations center gsoc to provide 24hourday 365dayyear realtime monitoring of global risks to dow assets and people the gsoc employs stateoftheart social media monitoring threat reporting and geofencing capabilities to analyze global risks and report those risks facilitating decisionmaking and actions to prevent dow crises 

through the implementation of the security code including voluntary security enhancements and upgrades made since 2002 the company is wellpositioned to comply with us chemical facility regulations and other regulatory security frameworks the company is currently participating with the american chemistry council to review and update the security code 

the company continues to work collaboratively across the supply chain on responsible care® supply chain design emergency preparedness shipment visibility and transportation of hazardous materials the company is cooperating with public and private entities to lead the implementation of advanced tank car design and track and trace technologies further the company’s distribution risk review process that has been in place for decades was expanded to address potential threats in all modes of transportation across the company’s supply chain to reduce vulnerabilities the company maintains security measures that meet or exceed regulatory and industry security standards in all areas in which they operate 

the companys initiatives relative to chemical security emergency preparedness and response community awareness and emergency responses and crisis management are implemented consistently at all dow sites on a global basis the company participates with chemical associations globally and participates as an active member of the us delegation to the g7 global partnership subworking group on chemical security 

climate change 

climate change matters for the company are likely to be driven by changes in regulations public policy and physical climate parameters 

regulatory matters 

regulatory matters include cap and trade schemes increased greenhouse gas “ghg” limits and taxes on ghg emissions fuel and energy the potential implications of each of these matters are all very similar including increased cost of purchased energy additional capital costs for installation or modification of ghg emitting equipment and additional costs associated directly with ghg emissions such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes which are primarily related to energy use it is difficult to estimate the potential impact of these regulatory matters on energy prices 

reducing the companys overall energy usage and ghg emissions through new and unfolding projects will decrease the potential impact of these regulatory matters the company also has a dedicated commercial group to handle energy contracts and purchases including managing emissions trading the company has not experienced any material impact related to regulated ghg emissions and continues to evaluate and monitor this area for future developments 

physical climate parameters 

many scientific academies throughout the world have concluded that it is very likely that human activities are contributing to global warming at this point it is difficult to predict and assess the probability and opportunity of a global warming trend on the company specifically preparedness plans are developed that detail actions needed in the event of severe weather these measures have historically been in place and these activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness dow continues to study the longterm implications of changing climate parameters on water availability plant siting issues and impacts and opportunities for products 

dow’s energy business and public affairs and sustainability functions are tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy that addresses the potential challenges of energy security and ghg emissions on the company dow continues to elevate its internal focus and external positions  to focus on the root causes of ghg emissions  including the unsustainable use of energy the companys energy plan provides the roadmap 

 

through corporate energy efficiency programs and focused ghg management efforts the company has and is continuing to reduce its ghg emissions footprint dow’s manufacturing intensity measured in btu per pound of product has improved by more than 40 percent since 1990 as part of the 2025 sustainability goals the company will maintain ghg emissions below 2006 levels on an absolute basis for all ghgs 

the company intends to implement the recommendations of the financial stability boards task force on climaterelated financial disclosures task force over the next three years which is aligned with the recommendations of the task force 

environmental remediation 

the company accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and regulatory requirements the nature of such remediation can include management of soil and groundwater contamination the accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements to assess the impact on the financial statements environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability and the ability to apply remediation technologies these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available the company had an accrued liability of 948 million at december 31 2019  related to the remediation of current or former dowowned sites at december 31 2018  the liability related to remediation was 654 million  

in addition to current and former dowowned sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and equivalent state laws hereafter referred to collectively as superfund law the company is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where the company allegedly disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances because superfund law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site the company has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that also have been named potentially responsible parties “prps” at each site the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share the company’s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites was 207 million at december 31 2019  156 million at december 31 2018  the company has not recorded any thirdparty recovery related to these sites as a receivable 

information regarding environmental sites is provided below 



 

additional information is provided below for the company’s midland michigan manufacturing site and midland offsite locations collectively the midland sites as well as a superfund site in woodridge new jersey the locations for which the company has the largest potential environmental liabilities 

in the early days of operations at the midland manufacturing site wastes were usually disposed of onsite resulting in soil and groundwater contamination which has been contained and managed onsite under a series of resource conservation and recovery act permits and regulatory agreements  the hazardous waste operating license for the midland manufacturing site issued in 2003 and renewed and replaced in september 2015 also included provisions for the company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of offsite contamination from historic midland manufacturing site operations in january 2010 the company the us environmental protection agency epa and the state of michigan state entered into an administrative order on consent that requires the company to conduct a remedial investigation a feasibility study and a remedial design for the tittabawassee river the saginaw river and the saginaw bay and pay the oversight costs of the epa and the state under the authority of cercla see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for further information relating to midland offsite environmental matters 

rohm and haas a wholly owned subsidiary of the company is a prp at the woodridge new jersey ventronvelsicol superfund site and the adjacent berry’s creek study area bcsa collectively the woodridge sites rohm and haas is a successor 

in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments in 2018 the berry’s creek study area potentially responsible party group “prp group” consisting of over 100 prps completed a remedial investigationfeasibility study for the bcsa during that time the epa concluded that an “iterative or adaptive approach” was appropriate for cleaning up the bcsa thus each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work in september 2018 the epa signed a record of decision rod 1 which describes the initial phase of the epa’s plan to cleanup the bcsa rod 1 will remediate waterways and major tributaries in the most contaminated part of the bcsa the prp group has signed agreements with the epa to design the selected remedy although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the bcsa and rohm and haass share of these costs has yet to be determined the range of activities that are required in the interim record of decision is known in general terms 

at december 31 2019 the company had accrued liabilities totaling 368 million  240 million at december 31 2018 for environmental remediation at the midland and woodridge sites in 2019  the company spent 32 million  32 million in 2018  for environmental remediation at the midland and woodridge sites 

during the third quarter of 2019 the company accrued additional liabilities totaling 447 million related to environmental remediation matters at a number of current and historical locations the additional accrual primarily resulted from the culmination of longstanding negotiations and discussions with regulators and agencies including technical studies supporting higher cost estimates for final or staged remediation plans the company’s evaluation of the cost required to manage remediation activities at sites affected by dow’s separation from dowdupont and related agreements with corteva and dupont and the company’s review of its closure strategies and obligations to monitor ongoing operations and maintenance activities in addition the company recorded indemnification assets of 48 million related to dow silicones’ environmental matters net of indemnifications the company recognized a pretax charge of 399 million related to these environmental matters included in “cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income 

in total the company’s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was 1155 million at december 31 2019  compared with 810 million at december 31 2018  this is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately one and a half times that amount consequently it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows it is the opinion of the company’s management however that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled 588 million in 2019  176 million in 2018 and 163 million in 2017  the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to operating the companys current pollution abatement facilities excluding internal recharges totaled 677 million in 2019  695 million in 2018 and 566 million in 2017  capital expenditures for environmental protection were 83 million in 2019  55 million in 2018 and 57 million in 2017  

asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation 

union carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestosrelated suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestoscontaining products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining products located on union carbide’s premises and union carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary amchem in many cases plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide’s products 

the table below provides information regarding asbestosrelated claims pending against union carbide and amchem based on criteria developed by union carbide and its external consultants 



plaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants as a result the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to union carbide amchem or any other particular defendant even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury in fact there are no asbestos personal injury cases in which only union carbide andor amchem are the sole named defendants for these reasons and based upon union carbide’s litigation and settlement experience union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestosrelated liability 

for additional information see part i item 3 legal proceedings and asbestosrelated matters of union carbide corporation in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company’s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices to manage such risks effectively the company enters into hedging transactions pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities where appropriate a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional nonspecific exposure within established limits and policies derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company’s results 

the global nature of the company’s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets the company has assets liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar the primary objective of the company’s foreign currency risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows to achieve this objective the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts overthecounter option contracts crosscurrency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies exposures primarily relate to assets liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies as well as economic exposure which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities the largest exposures are denominated in european currencies the japanese yen and the chinese yuan although exposures also exist in the canadian dollar the indian rupee and other currencies in asia pacific latin america the middle east and africa 

the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile to achieve this objective the company hedges using interest rate swaps “swaptions” and exchangetraded instruments the company’s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 

the company has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company’s market risk policies and procedures 

inherent in the company’s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments natural gas and crude oil along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production constitute the main commodity exposures overthecounter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 

the company uses valueatrisk “var” stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes var estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time using specified confidence levels the var methodology used by the company is a variancecovariance model this model uses a 975 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data the 2019 and 2018 yearend and average daily var for the aggregate of all positions are shown below these amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the company 



the company’s composite var for the aggregate of all positions decreased from 145 million at december 31 2018 to 137 million at december 31 2019  the interest rate and commodities var declined due to a decrease in exposure the equity securities var declined due to a decrease in managed exposures and lower equity volatility the foreign exchange var increased due to increased hedging see note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding market risk
