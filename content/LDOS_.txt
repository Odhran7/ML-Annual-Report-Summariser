we compete on various factors including our technical expertise and qualified professional andor securitycleared personnel our ability to deliver innovative costeffective solutions in a timely manner successful program execution our reputation and standing with customers pricing the size and geographic presence of our company and past performance credentials 

contract procurement 

our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government and other contracts the us government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives today us government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many us government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or prequalify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through singleaward contracts the predominant contracting methods through which us government agencies procure services and products include the following 

• definitive award contracts us government agencies may procure services and products through single definitive award contracts which specify the scope of services or products purchased and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services or products when an agency has a requirement the agency will issue a solicitation or request for proposal to which interested contractors can submit a proposal the bidding and selection process can take a year or more to complete for the contractor this method of contracting may provide greater certainty of the timing and amounts to be received at the time of contract award because it generally results in the customer contracting for a specific scope of services or products from the single definitive successful awardee 

• indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity idiq contracts the us government uses idiq contracts to obtain commitments from contractors to provide certain services or products on preestablished terms and conditions the us government then issues task orders under the idiq contracts to purchase the specific services or products it needs idiq contracts are awarded to one or more contractors following a competitive procurement process under a singleaward idiq contract all task orders under that contract are awarded to one preestablished contractor under a multipleaward idiq contract task orders can be awarded to any of the preestablished contractors which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders multipleaward idiq contracts that are open for any government agency to use for procurement are commonly referred to as governmentwide acquisition contracts idiq contracts often have multiyear terms and unfunded ceiling amounts therefore enabling but not committing the us government to purchase substantial amounts of services or products from one or more contractors at the time an idiq contract is awarded prior to the award of any task orders a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the us government will purchase under the contract and in the case of a multipleaward idiq the contractor from which such purchases may be made 

leidos holdings inc annual report  11 

part i 

• us general services administration gsa schedule contracts the gsa maintains listings of approved suppliers of services and products with agreedupon prices for use throughout the us government in order for a company to provide services under a gsa schedule contract a company must be prequalified and awarded a contract by the gsa when an agency uses a gsa schedule contract to meet its requirements the agency or the gsa on behalf of the agency conducts the procurement the user agency or the gsa on its behalf evaluates the user agency’s requirements and initiates a competition limited to gsa schedule qualified contractors gsa schedule contracts are designed to provide the user agency with reduced procurement time and lower procurement costs similar to idiq contracts at the time a gsa schedule contract is awarded a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the us government will purchase under the contract 

• other transaction authority “ota” agreements under certain circumstances us government agencies can enter into ota agreements instead of traditional contracts these agreements are used for two primary purposes 1 to carry out basic applied or advanced research projects that typically relate to technology stimulation or research and 2 to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms systems components or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the dod or to improve platforms systems components or materials in use by dod components and agencies ota agreements are generally exempt from federal procurement regulations these exemptions grant the us government the flexibility to include amend or exclude contract clauses and requirements that are mandatory in traditional procurements ota agreements also grant more flexibility to structure agreements in numerous ways including joint ventures partnerships or multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers 

we often partner with other companies including our competitors to submit bids for large us government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract our relationships with our partners including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program contract or customer requirements as well as the relative size qualifications capabilities customer relationships and experience of our company and our partners 

contracting with the us government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks including the us government’s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the us government issues a termination for convenience these regulations and risks are described in more detail below under business–regulation and risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

contract types 

generally the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the us government and may depend on certain factors including the type and complexity of the work to be performed degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals we generate revenues under several types of contracts including the following 

• costreimbursement contracts include costplusfixedfee awardfee and incentive  fee contracts these contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allocable indirect costs plus a fee these contracts are typically used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixedprice contract costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk but require us to use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and budget award and incentive fees are generally based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality andor technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the companys performance against contractual criteria incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs 

leidos holdings inc annual report  12 

part i 

• fixedpriceincentivefee fpif contracts are substantially similar to costplusincentivefee contracts except they require specified targets for cost and profit price ceiling but not a profit ceiling or floor and profit adjustment formula under an fpif contract the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to a costshare arrangement which affects profitability generally if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated 

• timeandmaterials tm contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor plus reimbursement of other direct costs this type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty about the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence on tm contracts we assume the risk of providing appropriately qualified staff to perform these contracts at the hourly rates set forth in the contracts over the period of performance of the contracts 

• fixedpricelevelofeffort fploe contracts are substantially similar to tm contracts except they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time on work that can be stated only in general terms this type of contract is generally used when the contractor is required to perform an investigation or study in a specific research and development area and to provide a report showing the results achieved based on the level of effort payment is based on the effort expended rather than the results achieved 

• firmfixedprice “ffp” contracts provide for a fixed price for specified products systems andor services this type of contract is typically used when the customer acquires products and services on the basis of reasonably definitive specifications that have a determinable fair and reasonable price these contracts offer us potential increased profits if we can complete the work at lower costs than planned but ffp contracts increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns 

our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract and the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentivefee and awardfee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts generally have lower profitability than ffp contracts 

seasonality 

the us governments fiscal year ends on september 30 of each year while not certain it is not uncommon for us government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter in addition our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter we tend to generate less revenue from our labor services during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season 

regulation 

we are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate we provide services and products to numerous us government agencies and entities including to the dod the us intelligence community and the dhs when working with these and other us government agencies and entities we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of contracts some significant laws and regulations that affect us include 

• the federal acquisition regulation far and supplements including the dod federal federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars which regulate the formation administration and performance of us government contracts

• the false statements act which imposes civil and criminal liability for making false statements to the us government and 

• the us government cost accounting standards cas which imposes accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts 

these regulations impose a broad range of requirements many of which are unique to government contracting including various procurement import and export security contract pricing and cost contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements among other things these laws and regulations 

• require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations 

• define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various costtype us government contracts

in your evaluation of our company and business you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with information disclosed elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this annual report and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed and our stock price could decline our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as our ability to collect receivables overall us and global economic and industry conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest exchange rates and inflation terrorism international conflicts major health concerns climate change or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially harm our business financial condition or operating results and result in a decline in our stock price 

industry and economic risks 

we depend on government agencies as our primary customers and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

we generated approximately 87 of our total revenues during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 from contracts with the us government including all branches of the us military either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government we expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under us government contracts our reputation and relationship with the us government particularly with the agencies of the dod and the us intelligence community are key factors in maintaining and growing our revenues negative publicity including reports from the press or social media coverage regardless of accuracy or completeness and which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct conflicts of interest poor contract performance deficiencies in services reports products or other deliverables information security breaches or other aspects of our business could harm our reputation particularly with these agencies due to the sensitive nature of our work and our confidentiality obligations to our customers and despite our ongoing efforts to provide transparency we may be unable to or limited in our ability to respond to such negative publicity which could also harm our reputation and our business if our reputation is negatively affected certain customers could cease to do business with us in addition our ability to hire or retain employees and our standing in professional communities to which we contribute and receive expert knowledge could be diminished if any of the foregoing occurs the amount of business with the us government and other customers could decrease and our business future revenues financial condition and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

a decline in the us government budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

revenues under contracts with the dod and us intelligence community either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors represented approximately 44 of our total revenues for fiscal 2021 49 of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 and 48 of our total revenues for fiscal 2019 levels of us government and dod spending are difficult to predict and subject to significant risk laws and plans adopted by the us government relating to along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the us federal budget potential changes in budgetary priorities and defense spending levels the appropriations process and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold including the defense spending priorities of the us presidential administration and congress and what challenges budget reductions will present for us and our industry generally 

current us government spending levels for defenserelated or other programs may not be sustained and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas where we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of uncertainty surrounding the federal budget increasing political pressure and legislation shifts in spending priorities from defenserelated or other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors if government funding relating to our contracts with the us government or dod becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed or planned orders are reduced our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or 

leidos holdings inc annual report  16 

part i 

the prime contractor our operating results could also be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the us government or the dod as well as delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts 

the us government also conducts periodic reviews of us defense strategies and priorities which may shift dod or other budgetary priorities reduce overall us government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defenserelated or other programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues in addition changes to the federal or dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so a significant decline in overall us government spending including in the areas of national security intelligence and homeland security a significant shift in its spending priorities the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defenserelated programs or significant delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations and limit our growth prospects 

because we depend on us government contracts a delay in the completion of the us governments budget and appropriation process could delay procurement of the products services and solutions we provide and adversely affect our future revenues 

the funding of us government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriations process in years when the us government does not complete its appropriations before the beginning of the new fiscal year on october 1 government operations are typically funded pursuant to a continuing resolution which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous appropriations cycle but does not authorize new spending initiatives when the us government operates under a continuing resolution delays can occur in the procurement of the products services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being canceled from time to time we have experienced a decline in revenues in our fourth quarter as a result of this annual appropriations cycle and we could experience similar declines in revenues from future delays in the appropriations process when the us government fails to complete its appropriations process or provide for a continuing resolution a full or partial federal government shutdown may result a federal government shutdown could in turn result in our incurrence of substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts the delay or cancellation of key programs or the delay of contract payments which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results of operations congress appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis for many programs even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless or until additional funds are obligated to the contract in addition when supplemental appropriations are required to operate the us government or fund specific programs and passage of legislation needed to approve any supplemental appropriations bill is delayed the overall funding environment for our business could be adversely affected 

due to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability 

we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process the us government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a continuing competitive bidding process including gsa schedule and other multiaward contracts which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure the competitive bidding process involves substantial costs including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us may be split among competitors or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders and several risks including the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win following contract award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding any resulting loss or delay of startup and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues and profitability in addition multiaward contracts require that we make sustained postaward efforts to obtain task orders under the contract as a result we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multiaward contracts we are also experiencing increased competition generally which impacts our ability to obtain contracts see the risk factor “we face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects” our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

leidos holdings inc annual report  17 

part i 

the us government may terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and if we do not replace them this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability 

many of the us government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years these programs are typically funded on an annual basis under our contracts the us government generally has the right not to exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience any decisions by the us government to not exercise contract options or to terminate cancel modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues revenue growth and profitability 

we have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts some of our contracts involve developing complex systems and products to achieve challenging customer goals in a competitive procurement environment as a result we sometimes experience technological or other performance difficulties which have in the past and may in the future result in delays cost overruns and failures in our performance of these contracts if a government customer terminates a contract for default we may be exposed to liability including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and products from another source depending on the nature and value of the contract a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation 

we face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects 

our business is highly competitive and we compete with larger companies with greater name recognition financial resources and a larger technical staff we also compete with smaller more specialized companies that can concentrate their resources on particular areas additionally we compete with the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers for example some customers including the dod are turning to commercial contractors rather than traditional defense contractors for some products and services and may utilize small business contractors or determine to source work internally rather than hiring a contractor  the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing customer needs and technology and our success depends on our ability to invest in and develop services and products that address such needs to remain competitive we must consistently provide superior service technology and performance on a costeffective basis to our customers while understanding customer priorities and maintaining customer relationships our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide including technical qualifications past contract experience geographic presence price and the availability of qualified professional personnel or be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts 

some of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses or establish teaming or other agreements among themselves or third parties which allow them to offer more competitive and comprehensive solutions as a result of such acquisitions or arrangements our current or potential competitors may be able to accelerate the adoption of new technologies that better address customer needs devote more significant resources to bring these products and services to market initiate or withstand substantial price competition develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do or limit our access to certain suppliers these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in fewer orders reduced revenue and margins and loss of market share further industry consolidation may also impact customers’ perceptions of the viability of smaller or even midsize software firms and consequently customers’ willingness to purchase from such firms 

legal and regulatory risks 

our failure to comply with various complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties including termination of our us government contracts disqualification from bidding on future us government contracts and suspension or debarment from us government contracting 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers such laws and regulations may potentially impose added costs on our business and our failure to comply with them may lead to civil or criminal penalties termination of our us government contracts or suspension or debarment from contracting with federal agencies for additional background on the regulations that apply to our business and the related compliance risks see “regulation” within item 1 of this annual report on form 10k and the risk factor “our business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and growth prospects  the far and

many of our us government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers organizational conflicts of interest arise when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the us government impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage a conflict of interest issue that precludes our competition for or performance on a significant program or contract could harm our prospects 

the us government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies and recovery of costs among other items us government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors legislation regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of us government agencies such as increased usage of fixedprice contracts multipleaward contracts and small business setaside contracts could have adverse effects on government contractors including us any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when customers recompete those contracts any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues profitability and prospects 

as a us government contractor our partners and we are subject to reviews audits and cost adjustments by the us government which could adversely affect our profitability cash position or growth prospects if resolved unfavorably to us 

us government contractors including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies including the dcaa dcma the dod inspector general and others these agencies review a contractors performance on government contracts cost structure indirect rates and pricing practices compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations terms and standards and the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements they also review the adequacy of the contractor’s compliance with government standards for its business systems including a contractors accounting system earned value management system estimating system materials management and accounting system property management system and purchasing system 

as a result of increased scrutiny on contractors and us government agencies audits and reviews are conducted rigorously and the applicable standards are strictly interpreted increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome a finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our us government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and the dcma accepts our remediations government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds such adjustments can be applied retroactively which could result in significant customer refunds our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an approved determination of our various business systems from the responsible us government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process a determination of noncompliance could also result in the us government imposing penalties and sanctions against us including reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination withholding of payments the loss of exportimport privileges administrative or civil judgments and liabilities criminal judgments or convictions liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements other sanctions the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief or actions suspension or debarment suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could negatively impact our reputation delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts perform contracts or compete for contracts with the us government as of december 31 2021 indirect cost audits by the dcaa remain open for fiscal 2016 and subsequent fiscal years although we have recorded contract revenues based upon our estimate of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review we cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and if future adjustments exceed our estimates our profitability may be adversely affected

our business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and growth prospects 

we are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to federal state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside the us if a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities we may be subject to disgorgement of profits fines damages litigation civil or criminal penalties exclusion from sales channels or sales opportunities injunctions or administrative sanctions including the termination of contracts the triggering of price reduction clauses suspension of payments suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies or other consequences we may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry if we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation our revenues profitability cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected more generally increases in scrutiny and investigations from government organizations legislative bodies or agencies into business practices and major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation revenues profitability and growth prospects 

investigations audits claims disputes enforcement actions litigation arbitration or other legal proceedings could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability and could damage our reputation 

we are subject to and may become a party to various other litigation claims investigations audits enforcement actions arbitrations or other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation could be costly to defend and even if we are successful or fully indemnified or insured they could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future and responding to any action may result in a significant diversion of managements attention and resources litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future for a description of our current legal proceedings see item 3 legal proceedings  along with note 21—commitments and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

our business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous state federal and international laws and directives and regulations in the us and abroad that involve matters central to our business including data privacy and protection employment and labor relations immigration taxation anticorruption antibribery importexport controls trade restrictions internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation and anticompetition compliance with legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources we also conduct business in certain identified growth areas such as health information technology energy and environmental services which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk violations of one or more of these legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages fines and criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations 

our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security which could subject us to investigations claims or monetary penalties against us require us to change our business practices or otherwise adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the us and abroad relating to data privacy and security these laws and regulations are complex constantly evolving and may be subject to significant change in the future in addition the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in new and rapidly evolving areas of technology and may differ in material respects among jurisdictions interpreted and 

leidos holdings inc annual report  20 

part i 

applied inconsistently among jurisdictions or in a manner that is inconsistent with our current policies and practices all of which can make compliance challenging and costly and expose us to related risks and liabilities 

as a contractor supporting defense health care and national security clients we are also subject to certain additional specific regulatory compliance requirements relating to data privacy and security under dfars and other federal regulations we are required to implement the security and privacy controls in national institute of standards and technology special publications on certain of our networks and information technology systems to the extent that we do not comply with the applicable security and control requirements and there is unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information this could potentially result in a contract termination or information security issues which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and lead to reputational harm we will also be subject to the dod cybersecurity maturity model certification “cmmc” requirements which will require contractors processing critical national security information on their it systems to receive specific thirdparty certifications relating to specified cybersecurity standards to be eligible for contract awards in addition our subcontractors and in some cases our vendors also may be required to adhere to the cmmc program requirements and potentially to achieve certification should our supply chain fail to meet compliance requirements or achieve certification this may adversely affect our ability to receive awards or execute on relevant government programs we are in the process of evaluating our readiness and preparing for the cmmc but to the extent we are unable to achieve certification in advance of contract awards that specify the requirement in the future we will be unable to bid on such contract awards or followon awards for existing work with the dod depending on the level of standard as required for each solicitation which could adversely impact our revenue and profitability in addition any obligations that may be imposed on us under the cmmc may be different from or in addition to those otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations which may cause additional expense for compliance 

the overarching complexity of data privacy and security laws and regulations around the world pose a compliance challenge that could manifest in costs damages or liability in other forms as a result of failure to implement proper programmatic controls failure to adhere to those controls or the breach of applicable data privacy and security requirements by us our employees our business partners including our service providers suppliers or subcontractors or our customers we also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning data privacy and security and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards or amendments to or reinterpretations of existing laws regulations or standards may have on our business any failure or perceived failure by us our service providers suppliers subcontractors or other business partners to comply with applicable laws regulations and other obligations in these areas could result in regulatory actions or lawsuits against us legal liability fines damages and other costs we may also incur substantial expenses in implementing and maintaining compliance with such laws regulations and other obligations for additional background on the privacy laws that apply to our business and the related compliance risks see “regulation” within item 1 of this annual report on form 10k 

business and operational risks 

the extent to which our business will be adversely affected by covid19 or other health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

the outbreak and global spread of covid19 and the preventative or protective actions that governments corporations individuals and we are taking and may continue to take in an effort to limit the impact of covid19 have resulted in a period of business disruption and increased economic uncertainty the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including vaccination and testing requirements employee travel access to customer sites employee and contractor remote work and restrictions to physical participation in meetings events and conferences illness travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions could adversely affect our supply chain and our access to suppliers of important technologies and components our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients’ projects our ability to provide services to our clients or our other business processes we may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners or may be required by government authorities for example on september 9 2021 president biden issued a series of executive orders to combat covid19 including an executive order that would have required us as a federal contractor to have our employees fully vaccinated unless the employee is legally entitled to a religious or medical exemption that executive order is currently under a nationwide injunction and its future is uncertain in any event there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 in addition as local conditions and regulations continue to permit the return of employees to business generally our workforce may not be able to return to work in person immediately if at all or may instead choose to pursue competing employment opportunities including as 

leidos holdings inc annual report  21

a result of transportation childcare and ongoing health issues which could negatively affect our business if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions increased employee attrition facility closures or other restrictions due to covid19 or do not comply with our covid19 mitigation efforts or facility access requirements our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 

government agencies are our primary customers and the longterm impact of increased government spending in response to covid19 is uncertain this could result in a reevaluation of us government spending levels and priorities which could impact our business performance the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and the likelihood of an impact on us that could be material increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the locations in which we operate in particular the emergence of new and more transmissible covid19 variants including the efficacy of vaccines against such variants booster vaccinations or a lack of public acceptance of vaccines and low vaccination rates in certain parts of the us may delay economic recovery further even if vaccines are widely distributed and accepted there can be no assurance that vaccines will ultimately be successful in limiting or stopping the spread of covid19 

the global spread of covid19 has resulted in a substantial decline in demand for air travel which has adversely impacted the demand for products and services related to our airport security detection and automation business we are not able to predict whether covid19 will result in permanent changes to air travel behaviors including a permanent reduction in business travel as a result of the increased use of teleconferencing products and more broadly a general reluctance to travel by consumers each of which has and could continue to impact our business further new contract awards have been and may continue to be delayed and our ability to perform on our existing contracts has been and may continue to be delayed or impaired which will negatively impact our revenues in addition our program costs have increased as a result of covid19 and these cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance or equitable adjustments to contract prices 

misconduct of employees subcontractors agents suppliers business partners or joint ventures and others working on our behalf could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation 

misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws such as the antikickback act and the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal state or local government procurement regulations regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts laws and regulations relating to environmental health or safety matters bribery of foreign government officials importexport control lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims remediation costs regulatory investigations or sanctions against us corruption or disruption of our systems or those of our customers impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers loss of current and future contracts indemnity obligations serious harm to our reputation and other potential liabilities see also the risk factor “cybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position  ” although we have implemented policies procedures training and other compliance controls to prevent and detect these activities these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and as a result we could face unknown risks or losses this risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand and do business with new partners in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures meaning joint efforts or business arrangements of any type our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could damage our reputation and subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions fines and penalties restitution or other damages loss of security clearance loss of current and future customer contracts loss of privileges and other sanctions including suspension or debarment from contracting with federal state or local government agencies any of which would adversely affect our business reputation and our future results 

leidos holdings inc annual report  22

a failure to attract train retain and motivate skilled employees including our management team would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations 

our continued success and ability to compete in a highly competitive environment depend on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled science engineering technical math and professional personnel competition for skilled personnel is intense and many us government programs also require contractors to have security clearances certain of which can be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and personnel with such security clearances are in great demand as a result it is difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner which may affect our growth although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit train and retain qualified employees we may not be able to attract effectively train and retain these employees any failure to do so could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations efficiently and timely meet our customers’ needs and win new business which could adversely affect our future results in addition certain personnel may be required to receive various security clearances to work on certain customer engagements or to perform certain tasks necessary security clearances may be delayed or not obtained which may negatively impact our ability to perform on such engagements in a timely matter or at all we believe that our success will also depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and its ability to retain existing business generate new business execute on our business plans in an efficient and effective manner and continually develop new members of senior management an inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives or our failure to continue to develop new members could cause us to lose customers or new business opportunities 

we may not realize the full amounts reflected in our backlog as revenues which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects 

as of december 31 2021 our total backlog was 345 billion including 74 billion in funded backlog due to the us governments ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our nonus government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances we may realize less than expected revenues or may never realize revenues from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog our unfunded backlog in particular contains management’s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues if we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog our future revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to estimate and manage costs time and resources accurately 

we generate revenues under various types of contracts including costreimbursement fpif tm fploe and ffp contracts our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentivefee and awardfee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts are generally less profitable than ffp contracts our operating results in any period may also be affected positively or negatively by customers variable purchasing patterns of our more profitable proprietary products 

our profitability is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers to varying degrees each of our contract types involves some risk underestimating the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract while ffp contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns revenues from ffp contracts represented approximately 37 of our total revenues for fiscal 2021 when making proposals on these types of contracts we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects as well as assumptions regarding technical issues in each case our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during performance could result and in some instances has resulted in reduced profits or losses more generally any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in the performance of our contracts including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control such as performance failures of our subcontractors rising inflation natural disasters or other force majeure events could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable 

we use estimates in recognizing revenues and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues our profitability may be adversely affected 

we recognize revenue on our servicebased contracts primarily over time as there is a continuous transfer of control to the customer throughout the contract as we perform the promised services which generally requires estimates of total 

leidos holdings inc annual report  23 

part i 

costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known changes in the underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results 

cybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position 

as a government contractor and a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies we and our service providers suppliers and subcontractors collect store transmit and otherwise process sensitive information including personally identifiable information protected health information personnel information classified information contractor unclassified information intellectual property and financial information concerning our business employees and customers therefore we are continuously exposed to unauthorized attempts to compromise such sensitive information through cyberattacks insider threats and other information security threats including physical breakins and malicious insiders any electronic or physical breakin or other security breach or compromise of our information technology systems and networks or facilities or those of our service providers suppliers or subcontractors may jeopardize the security of information stored or transmitted through these systems and networks or stored in those facilities this could lead to disruptions in missioncritical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data or systems we could also be potentially subject to operational downtimes and delays and other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers some of these risks may be heightened due to protocols related to remote work implemented as a result of the covid19 pandemic we are also increasingly subject to customerdriven cybersecurity certification requirements which are expected to be necessary to win future contracts such security incidents also could result in liability or trigger other obligations under such contracts or increase the difficulty of winning future contracts many statutory requirements both in the us and abroad also include obligations for companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving certain types of data including obligations to notify affected individuals and regulators in the event of security breaches involving certain personal data which could result from breaches of our service providers our suppliers or subcontractors 

although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to protect against detect and mitigate these threats and attacks we and our service providers suppliers and subcontractors have faced and continue to face advanced and persistent attacks on our information systems we cannot guarantee that future incidents will not occur and if an incident does occur our incident response planning may not prove fully adequate we may also not be able to mitigate its impacts successfully techniques used by others to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or disrupt systems and networks for economic or strategic gain are constantly evolving increasingly sophisticated and increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against these techniques include cyberattacks phishing and impersonating authorized users among others and may be perpetrated by internal bad actors such as employees or contractors or by third parties including traditional computer hackers persons involved with wellfunded organized crime or statesponsored efforts 

we seek to detect and investigate all information security incidents and to prevent their occurrence prolongation or recurrence we continue to invest in and improve our threat protection detection and mitigation policies procedures and controls in addition we work with other companies in the industry and government participants on increased awareness and enhanced protections against information security and malicious insider threats however because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats which can be difficult to detect there can be no assurance that our policies procedures and controls or those of our service providers suppliers or subcontractors have protected against detected mitigated or will detect prevent or mitigate any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident we may be currently unaware of certain vulnerabilities or lack the capability to detect them which may allow them to persist in our information technology environment over long periods and even if discovered our remediation efforts may not be completely successful

we also may experience similar security threats to the information technology systems that we develop install or maintain under customer contracts although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners including our service providers suppliers and subcontractors to seek to minimize the potential for and impact of cyberattacks and other security threats we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities see also the risk factor “internal system or service failures or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability  ” 

the occurrence of any unauthorized access to attacks on or security breaches of our or our service providers suppliers or subcontractors information technology infrastructure systems or networks or data could disrupt our infrastructure systems networks or those of our customers impair our ability to provide services to our customers and may jeopardize the security of data collected stored transmitted or otherwise processed through our information technology infrastructure systems and networks as a result we could be exposed to claims fines penalties loss of revenues product development delays compromise corruption or loss of confidential proprietary or sensitive information including personal information or technical business information contract terminations and damages remediation costs and other costs and expenses regulatory investigations or sanctions indemnity obligations and other potential liabilities any of the foregoing could adversely affect our reputation ability to win work on sensitive contracts or loss of current and future contracts including sensitive us government contracts business operations and financial results we have insurance against some cyberrisks and attacks however our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event and such insurance may increase in cost or cease to be available on commercial terms in the future 

internal system or service failures or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

any system or service disruptions including those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services whether through our shared services organization or outsourced services if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could materially and adversely affect our business including among other things an adverse effect on our ability to perform on contracts bill our customers for work performed on our contracts collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner we and the service providers suppliers and subcontractors on which we rely are also subject to systems failures including network software or hardware failures whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats malicious insiders natural disasters power shortages terrorist attacks pandemics or other events which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business cause us to incur remediation costs subject us to claims and damage our reputation in addition the failure or disruption of our communications or those of our service providers suppliers or subcontractors could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption 

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters that could adversely affect our profitability and overall financial position 

we have significant operations including infrastructure information technology systems research facilities and centers of excellence located in regions that may be exposed to physical risks such as hurricanes earthquakes other damaging storms water levels wildfires and other natural disasters our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract including as a result of disruptions to their workforce and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers could decrease demand for our services could make existing customers unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual requirements to us including their payment obligations and could cause us to incur substantial expense including expenses or liabilities arising from potential litigation if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster it could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

there is also an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters in addition to physical risks climate change risk includes longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat sea level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility additionally transitioning to a lowcarbon economy may entail extensive policy

legal technology and market initiatives transition risks including changes in consumer preferences and additional regulatory requirements or taxes could increase our expenses and undermine our strategies in addition our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change including our involvement or our clients’ involvement in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change 

customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

many of the systems and networks that we develop install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions while we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions if a system or network that we develop install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats or other events we may experience loss of revenue remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and as a result our future results could be adversely affected 

our success depends in part on our ability to work with complex and rapidly changing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 

we design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in various environments the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and in particular by complex and rapidly evolving technologies our success depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers our success also depends on our continued access to suppliers of important technologies and components many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex or depend on factors not wholly within our control problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving such contractual requirements failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects in addition our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability such as problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract costs and fee payments we previously received 

we have classified contracts with the us government which may limit investor insight into portions of our business 

we derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the us government and its agencies that are subject to security restrictions eg contracts involving classified information and classified programs which preclude the dissemination of information and technology that is classified for national security purposes under applicable law and regulation in general access to classified information technology facilities or programs requires appropriate personnel security clearances is subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability and may also require appropriate facility clearances and other specialized infrastructure in the event of a security incident involving classified information technology facilities programs or personnel holding clearances we may be subject to legal financial operational and reputational harm we are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result investors have less insight into our classified business or our business overall however historically the business risks associated with our work on classified programs have not differed materially from those of our other government contracts

we have made and continue to make acquisitions investments joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 

we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures these transactions require a significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities even if successful these transactions could reduce earnings for a number of reasons including the amortization of intangible assets impairment charges acquired operations that are not yet profitable or the payment of additional consideration under earnout arrangements if an acquisition performs better than expected acquisitions investments and joint ventures pose many other risks that could adversely affect our reputation operations or financial results including that we may not be able to identify compete effectively for or complete suitable acquisitions and investments at prices we consider attractive we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions and investments on our business or realize anticipated synergies business growth or profitability and may be unable to recover investments in any such acquisitions and investments we may not be able to manage the integration process for acquisitions successfully and the integration process may divert management time and focus from operating our business including as a result of incompatible accounting information management or other control systems acquired technologies capabilities products and service offerings particularly those that are still in development when acquired may not perform as expected may have defects or may not be integrated into our business as expected we may have trouble retaining key employees and customers of an acquired business we may need to implement or improve controls procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls procedures and policies including those relating to financial reporting revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies we may assume legal or regulatory risks particularly with respect to smaller businesses that have immature business processes and compliance programs or we may face litigation or material liabilities that were not identified as part of our due diligence or for which we are unable to receive a purchase price adjustment or reimbursement through indemnification including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties or there may be other unanticipated writeoffs or charges we may be required to spend a significant amount of cash or to incur debt resulting in increased fixed payment obligations or covenants or other restrictions on us or issue shares of our common stock or convertible debt resulting in dilution of ownership we may not be able to influence the operations of our joint ventures effectively or we may be exposed to certain liabilities if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations and if our acquisitions investments or joint ventures fail perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we periodically divest businesses including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan these divestitures similarly require a significant investment of time and resources may disrupt our business distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business including through indemnification guarantee or other financial arrangements for a period of time following the transaction which would adversely affect our financial results 

goodwill and other intangible assets represent significant assets on our balance sheet and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations 

as of december 31 2021 goodwill and intangible assets net was 60 of our total assets  the amount of our goodwill may substantially increase in the future as a result of any acquisitions that we make intangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually in the case of intangible assets with indefinite lives examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition loss of key personnel or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions such as those related to federal budget cuts and the nation’s debt ceiling deteriorating market conditions for companies in our industry and unfavorable changes in discount rates could result in an impairment of goodwill and other intangibles any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our results of operations in the period in which they are recognized 

we depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors if we are not able to maintain these relationships or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer our revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

leidos holdings inc annual report  27 

part i 

we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors who are also often our competitors in other contexts to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services and products provided by us and other companies will help us to win and perform the contract our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us or if the us government terminates or reduces these other contractors’ programs does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract companies that do not have access to us government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies’ prospect of securing a future position as a prime us government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor customer concerns about the subcontractor our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract our hiring of a subcontractor’s personnel or the subcontractor’s failure to comply with applicable law if any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default a termination for default could eliminate a revenue source expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders especially if the customer is an agency of the us government 

our services and operations sometimes involve using handling or disposing of hazardous substances which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities 

some of our services and operations involve the assessment or remediation of environmental hazards and the use handling or disposal of hazardous substances these activities and our operations generally subject us to extensive foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations which among other things require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanctions including fines penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government our current and previous ownership and operation of real property also subject us to environmental protection laws some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property liable for hazardous substance releases even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases if we violate or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our inspection or detection systems fail to detect bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats 

we design develop manufacture sell service and maintain various inspection systems and related integration and automation systems designed to assist in detecting bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats in some instances we also train operators of such systems such systems utilize software algorithms to interpret data produced by the system and signal to the operator when a dangerous object or substance may be present such algorithms are probabilistic in nature and are generally designed to meet requirements established by regulatory agencies many of these systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag parcel container vehicle or other vessel others signal to the operator that further investigation is required and the training reliability and competence of the customers operator are crucial to the detection of suspicious items nevertheless if such a system were to fail to signal to an operator when an explosive or other contraband was in fact present resulting in significant damage we could become the subject of significant product liability claims there are many factors some of which are beyond our control which could result in the failure of our products to help detect the presence of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats some of these factors could include inherent limitations in our systems and misuse or malfunction of our systems the failure of our systems to help detect the presence of any of these dangerous materials could lead to injury death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability professional liability or other claims against us further if our security and inspection systems fail to or are perceived to have failed to help detect a threat we could experience negative publicity and reputational harm which could adversely affect our business

our insurance customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be insufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims or losses 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance and for those risks we insure the limits of coverage that are reasonably obtainable may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred we are limited in the amount of insurance we can obtain to cover certain risks such as cybersecurity risks and natural hazards such as earthquakes fires extreme weather conditions and pandemics if any of our thirdparty insurers fail becomes insolvent cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant product and other liability claims or losses moreover there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost if at all in some circumstances we are entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available can be difficult to obtain are typically subject to certain terms or limitations including the availability of funds and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred if liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage customer indemnifications or other legal protections our business financial position operating results and prospects may be harmed any significant claim may have an adverse effect on our industry and market reputation leading to a substantial decrease in demand for our products and services and reduced revenues 

we face risks associated with our international business 

our international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our us business these risks and challenges include failure to comply with us government and foreign laws and regulations applicable to international business including without limitation those related to employment privacy taxes data protection technology transfer information security environment data transfer import and export controls including the itar and the antiboycott provisions of the ear sanctions antibribery including the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar foreign anticorruption laws and other administrative legislative or regulatory actions that could materially interfere with our ability to offer our products or services in certain countries or have an adverse impact on our business with the us government and expose us to risks and costs of noncompliance with such laws and regulations in addition to administrative civil or criminal penalties increased financial and legal risks arising for example from foreign exchange rate variability imposition of tariffs or additional taxes inflation restrictive trade policies longer payment cycles delays or failures to collect amounts due to us and differing legal systems and which may adversely affect the performance of our services sale of our products or repatriation of our profits and political or economic instability in countries where we provide services and products in support of the us government and other customers in countries which increases the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life damage or destruction of property or inability to meet our contractual obligations our failure to comply with these laws might subject us to civil and criminal penalties that might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations although our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues we are seeking to grow our international business in which case these regulatory geopolitical and other factors may have a greater impact on our business in the future and could adversely affect our business 

we have only a limited ability to protect or exploit intellectual property rights which are important to our success our failure to adequately obtain maintain protect and enforce our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position 

we rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable however trade secrets are generally difficult to protect despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights third parties may attempt to obtain copy use or disclose our intellectual property or other proprietary information or technology without our authorization in addition to protection under the law we rely on confidentiality or license agreements that we generally enter into with our corporate partners employees consultants advisors service providers suppliers subcontractors and customers and we generally attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information although our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations and use restrictions this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent them from infringing misappropriating or otherwise violating our confidential information technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights and can be difficult to enforce we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights we may be required to expend significant resources

and efforts to monitor and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property or other proprietary rights may be outweighed by the expense or distraction to our management we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights but outcomes in any such litigation can be difficult to predict and could be timeconsuming result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel if we are unable to detect or prevent third parties from infringing misappropriating or otherwise violating our rights in our patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets or other proprietary rights or information our competitive position could be adversely affected also in connection with our performance of services for the us government the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts which means that the us government may disclose or license our information to third parties including in some instances our competitors any exercise by the us government of such rights could adversely affect our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may also from time to time inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims against our customers or us or we may face allegations that we or our service providers suppliers subcontractors or customers have violated the intellectual property rights of others if with respect to any claim against us for violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights we are unable to prevail in the litigation retain or obtain sufficient rights develop noninfringing solutions or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or costefficient basis our business and competitive position may be adversely affected such claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third partys intellectual property rights in addition our contracts generally indemnify our customers for thirdparty claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide besides the expense of defending such claims and the cost of any large indemnity payments any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations also could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations

from a macroeconomic perspective our industry is under general competitive pressures associated with spending from our largest customer the us government and requires a high level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive although the us presidential administration has not indicated a desire to reduce spending in the defense and homeland security sectors the likelihood extent and duration of current spending levels in these areas remains unclear we continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary 

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic is affecting major economic and financial markets and effectively all industries and governments are facing challenges which has resulted in a period of business disruption the length and severity of which cannot be predicted the pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions government orders to “shelterinplace” quarantine restrictions and disruption of the financial markets we have acted to protect the health and safety of our employees comply with workplace health and safety regulations and work with our customers to minimize disruptions 

for fiscal 2021 while we continue to navigate impacts associated with covid19 primarily relating to supply chain matters we believe that covid19 did not have a material impact to revenues and operating income as compared to prior year results the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance including our ability to execute on programs in the expected timeframe will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic and the distribution of vaccines all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted section 3610 of the cares act a 2 trillion coronavirus response bill providing widespread emergency relief authorized the government to reimburse qualifying contractors for the cost of certain impacts of covid19 while a portion of the recoveries that we have made are a result of section 3610 of the cares act the act expired on september 30 2021 

on september 9 2021 president biden issued a series of executive orders to combat covid19 one of which requires us as a federal contractor to have our employees fully vaccinated unless the employee is legally entitled to a religious or medical exemption this vaccine mandate is currently under a nationwide injunction while courts adjudicate constitutional challenges to the executive order we are prepared to comply with the executive order in the event the injunction is lifted 

business environment and trends 

us government markets 

in fiscal 2021 we generated approximately 87 of our total revenues from contracts with the us government either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government revenues under contracts with the dod and us intelligence community including subcontracts under which the dod or the us intelligence community is the ultimate purchaser represented approximately 44 of our total revenues for fiscal 2021 accordingly our business performance is affected by the overall level of us government spending especially national security homeland security and intelligence spending and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the us government 

congress received the gfy 2022 president’s budget request on may 28 2021 and passed a continuing resolution cr before the gfy deadline of september 30 2021 the cr fully funded the federal government at current levels through december 3 2021 and provides 286 billion in disaster relief and 63 billion to support afghanistan evacuees on december 2 2021 congress passed a second continuing resolution to fund the federal government at gfy 2021 levels until february 18 2022 the senate plans to vote on a housepassed continuing resolution the week of february 14 2022 that would extend government funding through march 11 2022 

congressional negotiations continue on defense and nondefense spending levels and controversial policy riders in the gfy 2022 appropriations bills president biden is expected to release the gfy 2023 president’s budget request this spring

trends in the us government contracting process including a shift towards multipleawards contracts in which certain contractors are preapproved using idiq and us general services administration gsa contract vehicles have increased competition for us government contracts reduced backlogs by shortening periods of performance on contracts and increased pricing pressure we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process for more information on these risks and uncertainties see “risk factors” in part i of this annual report on form 10k 

international markets 

sales to customers in international markets represented approximately 8 of total revenues for fiscal 2021 our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory foreign currency exchange rate and geopolitical risks 

changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials may increase our procurement costs of certain it hardware used both on our contracts and for internal use however we expect to recover certain portions of these higher tariffs through our costplus contracts while we evaluate the impact of higher tariffs currently we do not expect tariffs to have a significant impact to our business 

key performance measures 

the primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue operating income cash flows from operations and diluted earnings per share bookings and backlog are also useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our performance and potential future revenues in addition we consider business performance by contract type to be useful to management and investors when evaluating our operating income and margin performance

segment and corporate results 

the increase in revenues for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to program wins a net increase in volumes on certain programs 149 million of revenues from new business acquisitions and a reduction of the negative impacts from covid19 experienced during the prior year the increase was partially offset by the completion of certain contracts and contracts that were reassigned from the defense solutions reportable segment to the civil reportable segment during the third quarter in addition in fiscal 2021 there was a 67 million benefit in exchange rate movements 

the increase in operating income for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to program wins a net increase in program volumes on certain contracts 18 million of operating income from new business acquisitions and a reduction of the negative impacts from covid19 experienced during the prior year partially offset by the completion of certain contracts and an increase in amortization expense 



the increase in revenues for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a net increase of 48 million of revenues related to l3 harris technologies security and detection businesses the sda businesses acquired in the prior year a net increase in program volumes program wins and a reduction of the negative impacts from covid19 experienced during the prior year the revenue growth was also attributable to certain contracts that were reassigned from the defense solutions reportable segment to the civil reportable segment during the third quarter 

the decrease in operating income for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a net decrease in volumes on certain products and product deliveries partially offset by a 26 million benefit from an adjustment to legal reserves related to the mission support alliance joint venture during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 



the increase in revenues for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a net increase in volumes on certain programs including a reduction of the negative impacts from covid19 experienced during the prior year and program wins partially offset by the completion of certain contracts 

the increase in operating income for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a net increase in volumes on higher margin programs including a reduction of the negative impacts from covid19 experienced during the prior year program wins and a net decrease in asset impairment charges

the increase in operating loss for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to an 81 million net gain recognized during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 upon receipt of proceeds related to the virnetx inc legal matter and higher indirect expenses partially offset by a decrease in acquisition integration and restructuring costs 

equity earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries 

we have certain noncontrolling ownership interests in equity method investments for fiscal 2021 we recorded earnings of 20 million from our equity method investments for fiscal 2020 we recorded 16 million partially offset by amortization of 2 million 

nonoperating expense net 

nonoperating expense net decreased 32 million for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to 36 million of debt discount and deferred financing costs written off related to refinancing activities in the prior year partially offset by higher interest expenses 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 215 and 195 in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was favorably impacted primarily by federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was favorably impacted primarily by federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions partially offset by taxes related to foreign operations 

beginning in 2022 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development costs for tax purposes and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research costs over five years although it is possible that congress may defer modify or repeal this provision potentially with retroactive effect we have no assurance that congress will take any action with respect to this provision if the 2022 effective date remains in place based on the law as currently enacted our initial assessment is that our cash from operations will decrease by approximately 150 million in fiscal 2022 and our net deferred tax assets will increase by a similar amount the actual impact on fiscal 2022 cash from operations will depend on the amount of research and development costs the company will incur on whether congress modifies or repeals this provision and on whether new guidance and interpretive rules are issued by the us treasury among other factors 

noncontrolling interest 

we have an 88 controlling interest in mission support alliance llc msa a joint venture with centerra group llc which includes 41 purchased from jacobs group llc on january 26 2018 msa’s contract ended on january 24 2021 we also have a 53 controlling interest in hanford mission integration solutions llc hmis the legal entity for the followon contract to msas contract and a joint venture with centerra group llc and parsons government services inc we include the financial results for msa and hmis in our consolidated financial statements net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 6 million and 1 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively 

bookings and backlog 

we had net bookings of 155 billion and 178 billion during fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenue to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards that were received during the year net of any adjustments to previously awarded backlog amounts we calculate net bookings as the year’s ending backlog plus the year’s revenues less the prior year’s ending backlog and any impacts from foreign currency or acquisitions and divestitures 

leidos holdings inc annual report  40 

part ii 

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts we segregate our backlog into two categories as follows 

• funded backlog funded backlog for contracts with the us government represents the value on contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts funded backlog for contracts with nonus government entities and commercial customers represents the estimated value on contracts which may cover multiple future years under which we are obligated to perform less revenues previously recognized on the contracts 

• negotiated unfunded backlog negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding has not been appropriated and unexercised priced contract options negotiated unfunded backlog does not include unexercised option periods and future potential task orders expected to be awarded under idiq gsa schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles with the exception of certain idiq contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded and separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future anticipated task orders 

the estimated value of our total backlog for the periods presented was as follows 



the increase in backlog includes 800 million of backlog acquired in fiscal 2021 through business combinations in our defense solutions reportable segment 

total backlog included an unfavorable impact of 52 million at december 31 2021 and favorable impact of 119 million at january 1 2021 primarily due to the movements in the british pound and australian dollar when compared to the us dollar 

bookings and backlog fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards renewals modifications and cancellations as well as foreign currency movements contract awards may be negatively impacted by ongoing industrywide delays in procurement decisions and budget cuts by the us government as discussed in “business environment and trends” in this annual report on form 10k 

we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus government customers may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed

our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract for a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenues see “business—contract types” in part i of this annual report on form 10k revenues by contract type as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods presented were as follows 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

as of december 31 2021 we had 727 million in cash and cash equivalents additionally we have an unsecured revolving credit facility which can provide up to 750 million in additional borrowing if required during fiscal 2021 and 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities and we were in compliance with the related financial covenants 

at december 31 2021 and january 1 2021 we had outstanding debt of 51 billion and 47 billion respectively on may 7 2021 we entered into a credit agreement which provided for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 380 million 

additionally on july 12 2021 leidos inc established a commercial paper program in which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes not to exceed 750 million and have maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance see note 13—debt as of december 31 2021 we did not have any commercial paper notes outstanding 

we made principal payments on our longterm debt of 106 million 731 million and 80 million during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively this activity included required principal payments on our term loans of 96 million 72 million and 69 million during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively during fiscal year 2020 we made 4925 million of principal repayments for outstanding debt and retired the 450 million senior notesthe notes outstanding as of december 31 2021 contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2021 

interest on our credit facilities and 2021 credit agreement are calculated based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” on july 27 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority announced that libor would be discontinued or become unavailable as a reference rate by the end of 2021 and libor will be fully discontinued or become unavailable as a benchmark rate by june 2023 although our credit facilities and the 2021 credit agreement include mechanics to facilitate the adoption by us and our lenders of an alternative benchmark rate for use in place of libor no assurance can be made that such alternative benchmark rate will perform in a manner similar to libor or result in interest rates that are at least as favorable to us as those that would have resulted had libor remained in effect which could result in an increase in our interest expense and other debt service obligations in addition the overall credit market may be disrupted as a result of the replacement of libor or in the anticipation thereof which could have an adverse impact on our ability to refinance reprice or amend our existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness on favorable terms 

we paid dividends of 199 million 196 million and 198 million for fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

during the first and second quarter of fiscal 2021 we sold 693 million of accounts receivable under accounts receivable purchase agreements and received proceeds of 693 million see note 6—receivables there were no sales of accounts receivable in the second half of fiscal 2021

we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

stock repurchases of leidos common stock may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties including through accelerated share repurchase asr agreements whether repurchases are made and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including price corporate capital requirements other market conditions and regulatory requirements the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time 

during fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 we made open market repurchases of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 237 million 67 million and 25 million respectively 

additionally during fiscal 2019 we entered into asr agreements with financial institutions whereby we paid an aggregate of 400 million and received approximately 56 million shares of leidos outstanding shares see note 16—earnings per share of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k the purchases were recorded to additional paidin capital in the consolidated balance sheets all shares delivered were immediately retired 

beginning in 2022 a provision in the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “tcja” which eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development costs for tax purposes and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize the costs over five years becomes effective congress may defer modify or repeal the provision but the ultimate outcome is uncertain the uncertainty surrounding the tcja provision and the potential for covid19 to affect the financial markets may impact our liquidity if the 2022 effective date of the tcja research cost capitalization provision remains in place our initial assessment indicates we will have a negative impact to cash of approximately 150 million in fiscal 2022 and our net deferred tax assets will increase by a similar amount we will continue to assess our liquidity needs as the tax legislation and pandemic evolve 

for the next 12 months we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs including servicing our debt through cash generated from operations available cash balances sales of accounts receivable and if needed borrowings from our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program 

summary of cash flows 

the following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 303 million for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily due to the timing of customer advance payments 62 million of deferral for employer payroll tax payments in the prior year and the receipt of 85 million of proceeds related to the virnetx legal matter in the prior year partially offset with improved collections on trade accounts receivable 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 2085 million for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily due to larger acquisitions made in the prior year for dynetics and the sda businesses compared to our current year acquisitions see note 5–acquisitions and divestitures and lower capital expenditures in the current year 

leidos holdings inc annual report  43 

part ii 

net cash used in financing activities increased 1564 million for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the increase was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 1444 million from the net change of proceeds received from the issuance of debt principal payments and payments for debt issuance costs an increase of 170 million of open market stock repurchases partially offset by a net 34 million increase in capital contributions received from our noncontrolling interest 

offbalance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates and assumptions have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

• revenue recognition 

• goodwill and intangible assets 

revenue recognition 

we perform under various types of contracts which include firmfixedprice ffp timeandmaterials tm fixedpricelevelofeffort fploe costplusfixedfee cpff costplusawardfee costplusincentivefee and fixedpriceincentivefee contracts 

to determine the proper revenue recognition we first evaluate whether we have a duly approved and enforceable contract with a customer in which the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified and collectability is probable we also evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract including the task orders issued under an idiq award in addition we assess contract modifications to determine whether changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract if contract modifications add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by an amount that reflects the standalone selling price those modifications are accounted for as separate contracts 

in cases where our contracts contain multiple promises we assess if the multiple promises should be accounted for as separate performance obligations or combined into a single performance obligation we generally separate multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct both individually and in the context of the contract if multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or require significant integration or customization within a group they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation 

our contracts with the us government often contain options to renew existing contracts for an additional period of time generally a year at a time under the same terms and conditions as the original contract and generally do not provide the customer any material rights under the contract we account for renewal options as separate contracts when they include distinct goods or services at standalone selling prices 

contracts with the us government are subject to the far and priced on estimated or actual costs of providing the goods or services the far provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the us government and its agencies each contract is competitively priced and bid separately pricing for nonus government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer in circumstances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable we estimate the standalone selling price using the expected costplus margin approach any taxes collected or imposed when determining the transaction price are excluded 

certain costplus and fixedprice contracts contain award fees incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion we estimate variable consideration at the most probable amount that we expect to be entitled to based on the assessment of the contractual variable fee criteria complexity of work and related risks extent of customer discretion amount of variable consideration received historically and the potential of significant reversal of revenue 

leidos holdings inc annual report  46 

part ii 

we allocate the transaction price of a contract to its performance obligations in the proportion of its respective standalone selling prices the standalone selling price of the performance obligations is generally based on an expected costplus margin approach in accordance with the far for certain product sales prices from other standalone sales are used 

we recognize revenue on our servicebased contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the promised services are performed for us government contracts continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any workinprocess similarly for nonus government contracts the customer typically controls the workinprocess as evidenced by rights to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services for which we do not have an alternate use anticipated losses on servicebased contracts are recognized when incurred generally on a straightline basis over the contract term in certain product sales where the products have an alternate use revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer takes control of the asset usually denoted by possession transfer of legal title and acceptance by the customer 

on ffp contracts requiring system integration and costplus contracts with variable consideration revenue is recognized over time generally using a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation principally using a costinput method referred to as the costtocost method under the costtocost method revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costsatcompletion eac a performance obligations eac includes all direct costs such as materials labor subcontract costs overhead and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs in addition an eac of a performance obligation includes future losses estimated to be incurred on onerous contracts as and when known on certain other contracts principally tm fploe and cpff revenue is recognized using the righttoinvoice practical expedient as we are contractually able to invoice the customer based on the control transferred to the customer additionally on maintenance generally ffp performance obligations revenue is recognized over time using a straightline method as the control of the services is provided to the customer evenly over the period of performance 

for certain performance obligations where we are not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or service to the customer do not have inventory risk and do not have discretion in establishing the price for the goods or service we recognize revenue on a net basis 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date we recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date 

goodwill and intangible assets net collectively represent 60 of our total assets as of december 31 2021 and january 1 2021 

goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level and tested more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year using either a qualitative or quantitative approach during both fiscal 2021 and 2020 we had seven reporting units 

in our qualitative assessment we determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists based on qualitative factors qualitative factors include macroeconomic industry and market considerations overall financial performance industry legal and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit 

leidos holdings inc annual report  47 

part ii 

additionally as part of this assessment we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit’s fair value if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists then a quantitative assessment is performed we use discounted cash flow analyses and market multiple analyses in order to estimate reporting unit fair values discounted cash flow analyses rely on significant judgement and assumptions about expected future cash flows weightedaverage cost of capital discount rates expected longterm growth rates and operating margins these assumptions are based on estimates of future sales and earnings after considering such factors as general market conditions customer budgets existing firm and future orders changes in working capital long term business plans and recent operating performance market multiple analyses incorporate significant judgments and assumptions related to the selection of guideline public companies our forecast earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” forecast ebitda of guideline public companies and control premium estimates a significant change to these estimates and assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units and intangible assets to decline and increase the risk of an impairment charge to earnings intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

we performed our annual test for impairment as of october 2 2021 which resulted in no impairments being identified however through this analysis we determined that our security products reporting unit within the civil reportable segment which holds goodwill in the amount of 926 million as of december 31 2021 was at risk of future impairment the estimated fair value of the security products reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 6 operations of the reporting unit rely heavily on the sales and servicing of security and detection products which have been negatively impacted by covid19 the forecasts utilized to estimate the fair value of the security products reporting unit assume a gradual improvement in the global aviation security product and related service sales reaching precovid19 levels by fiscal 2025 in the event that there are significant unfavorable changes to the forecasted cash flows of the reporting unit including if the impact of covid19 on passenger travel levels is more prolonged or severe than what is incorporated into our forecast terminal growth rates or the cost of capital used in the fair value estimates we may be required to record a material impairment of goodwill at a future date 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

each quarter we evaluate impairment indicators to determine whether there is a triggering event warranting a goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the normal course of business our current market risk exposures are primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments contains forwardlooking statements 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to longterm debt obligations and derivatives our policy authorizes with board of directors approval the limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific interest rate risks 

debt and derivatives 

at december 31 2021 and january 1 2021 we had 51 billion and 47 billion respectively of shortterm and longterm debt which included 17 billion and 14 billion respectively related to our senior unsecured term loans that have a variable stated interest rate that is determined based on the london interbank offered rate libor rate plus a margin as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense 

leidos holdings inc annual report  48

intellectual property rights 

our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection although we do selectively seek patent protection we claim a proprietary interest in certain of our products software programs methodologies and knowhow this proprietary information is protected in confidence as trade secrets using nondisclosure and other definitive agreements we selectively pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties

in connection with the performance of services and solutions the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under us governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts generally the us government may disclose or license such information to third parties including in some instances our competitors in the case of some subcontracts that we perform the prime contractor generally obtains rights to use the programs and products that we deliver under the subcontract to perform its prime contract obligations 

competition 

competition for contracts is significant and we often compete against a large number of wellestablished corporations that may have greater name and brand recognition we also compete against smaller more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers as a result of the diverse requirements of the us government and our commercial customers we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations 

we believe that our principal competitors currently include the following companies amentum services inc booz allen hamilton inc caci international inc general dynamics corporation jacobs engineering group inc kbr inc l3harris lockheed martin corporation mantech international corporation northrop grumman corporation perspecta inc raytheon technologies corporation and saic these companies span across sectors that include engineering and technical services divisions of large defense contractors diversified us and international it providers and contractors focused solely on technical services supply chain management other logistics services and major systems operations and maintenance homeland security and health solutions 

we compete on various factors including our technical expertise and qualified professional andor securitycleared personnel our ability to deliver innovative costeffective solutions in a timely manner successful program execution our reputation and standing with customers pricing the size and geographic presence of our company and past performance credentials 

contract procurement 

our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government and other contracts the us government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives today us government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many us government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or prequalify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through singleaward contracts the predominant contracting methods through which us government agencies procure services and products include the following 

• definitive award contracts us government agencies may procure services and products through single definitive award contracts which specify the scope of services or products purchased and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services or products when an agency has a requirement the agency will issue a solicitation or request for proposal to which interested contractors can submit a proposal the bidding and selection process can take a year or more to complete for the contractor this method of contracting may provide greater certainty of the timing and amounts to be received at the time of contract award because it generally results in the customer contracting for a specific scope of services or products from the single definitive successful awardee 

leidos holdings inc annual report  10 

part i 

• indefinite deliveryindefinite quantity idiq contracts the us government uses idiq contracts to obtain commitments from contractors to provide certain services or products on preestablished terms and conditions the us government then issues task orders under the idiq contracts to purchase the specific services or products it needs idiq contracts are awarded to one or more contractors following a competitive procurement process under a singleaward idiq contract all task orders under that contract are awarded to one preestablished contractor under a multipleaward idiq contract task orders can be awarded to any of the preestablished contractors which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders multipleaward idiq contracts that are open for any government agency to use for procurement are commonly referred to as governmentwide acquisition contracts idiq contracts often have multiyear terms and unfunded ceiling amounts therefore enabling but not committing the us government to purchase substantial amounts of services or products from one or more contractors at the time an idiq contract is awarded prior to the award of any task orders a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the us government will purchase under the contract and in the case of a multipleaward idiq the contractor from which such purchases may be made 

• us general services administration gsa schedule contracts the gsa maintains listings of approved suppliers of services and products with agreedupon prices for use throughout the us government in order for a company to provide services under a gsa schedule contract a company must be prequalified and awarded a contract by the gsa when an agency uses a gsa schedule contract to meet its requirements the agency or the gsa on behalf of the agency conducts the procurement the user agency or the gsa on its behalf evaluates the user agency’s requirements and initiates a competition limited to gsa schedule qualified contractors gsa schedule contracts are designed to provide the user agency with reduced procurement time and lower procurement costs similar to idiq contracts at the time a gsa schedule contract is awarded a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the us government will purchase under the contract 

• other transaction authority “ota” agreements under certain circumstances us government agencies can enter into ota agreements instead of traditional contracts these agreements are used for two primary purposes 1 to carry out basic applied or advanced research projects that typically relate to technology stimulation or research and 2 to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms systems components or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the dod or to improve platforms systems components or materials in use by dod components and agencies ota agreements are generally exempt from federal procurement regulations these exemptions grant the us government the flexibility to include amend or exclude contract clauses and requirements that are mandatory in traditional procurements ota agreements also grant more flexibility to structure agreements in numerous ways including joint ventures partnerships or multiple agencies joining together to fund an agreement encompassing multiple providers 

we often partner with other companies including our competitors to submit bids for large us government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract our relationships with our partners including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program contract or customer requirements as well as the relative size qualifications capabilities customer relationships and experience of our company and our partners 

contracting with the us government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks including the us government’s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the us government issues a termination for convenience these regulations and risks are described in more detail below under business–regulation and risk factors in this annual report on form 10k

contract types 

generally the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the us government and may depend on certain factors including the type and complexity of the work to be performed degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals we generate revenues under several types of contracts including the following 

• costreimbursement contracts include costplusfixedfee awardfee and incentive  fee contracts these contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allocable indirect costs plus a fee these contracts are generally used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixedprice contract costreimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk but generally require us to use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and budget award and incentive fees are generally based on performance criteria such as cost schedule quality andor technical performance award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the companys performance against contractual criteria incentive fees that are based on cost provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later typically using a formula to measure performance against the associated criteria based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs 

• fixedpriceincentivefee fpif contracts are substantially similar to costplusincentivefee contracts except they require specified targets for cost and profit price ceiling but not a profit ceiling or floor and profit adjustment formula under an fpif contract the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to a costshare arrangement which affects profitability generally if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated 

• timeandmaterials tm contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor plus reimbursement of other direct costs this type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty about the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence on tm contracts we assume the risk of providing appropriately qualified staff to perform these contracts at the hourly rates set forth in the contracts over the period of performance of the contracts 

• fixedpricelevelofeffort fploe contracts are substantially similar to tm contracts except they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time on work that can be stated only in general terms this type of contract is generally used when the contractor is required to perform an investigation or study in a specific research and development area and to provide a report showing the results achieved based on the level of effort payment is based on the effort expended rather than the results achieved 

• ffp contracts provide for a fixed price for specified products systems andor services this type of contract is generally used when the government acquires products and services on the basis of reasonably definitive specifications and which have a determinable fair and reasonable price these contracts offer us potential increased profits if we can complete the work at lower costs than planned while ffp contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns 

our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract and the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentivefee and awardfee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts generally have lower profitability than ffp contracts

seasonality 

the us governments fiscal year ends on september 30 of each year while not certain it is not uncommon for us government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter in addition our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter we tend to generate less revenue from our labor services during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season 

regulation 

we are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate we provide services and products to numerous us government agencies and entities including to the dod the us intelligence community and the dhs when working with these and other us government agencies and entities we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of contracts us government contracts generally are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far which sets forth policies procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the us government agencyspecific regulations that implement or supplement the far such as the dod federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars and other applicable laws and regulations these regulations impose a broad range of requirements many of which are unique to government contracting including various procurement import and export security contract pricing and cost contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements among other things these laws and regulations 

• require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations 

• define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various costtype us government contracts 

• require compliance with us government cost accounting standards cas 

• require reviews by the defense contract audit agency dcaa defense contract management agency dcma and other us government agencies of compliance with government requirements for a contractor’s business systems 

• restrict the use and dissemination of and require the protection of unclassified contractrelated information and information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data and 

• require us not to compete for work if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest as defined by these laws and regulations related to such work exists andor cannot be appropriately mitigated neutralized or avoided 

the us government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time in order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance trainings relevant to their position 

some of our operations and service offerings involve access to and use by us of personally identifiable information andor protected health information these activities are regulated by extensive federal state and international privacy and data security laws requiring organizations to provide certain privacy protections and security safeguards for such information 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in addition our operations may become subject to future laws and regulations including those related to climate change and environmental sustainability see risk factors in this annual report on form 10k for further details although we do not currently anticipate that the costs of complying with or the liabilities associated with environmental laws will materially and adversely affect us we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future

industry and economic risks 

we depend on government agencies as our primary customers and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

we generated 87 of our total revenues during fiscal 2020 and 2019 and 85 of our total revenues during fiscal 2018 from contracts with the us government including all branches of the us military either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government we expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under us government contracts our reputation and relationship with the us government and in particular with the agencies of the dod and the us intelligence community are key factors in maintaining and growing our revenues negative press reports or publicity regardless of accuracy which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct conflicts of interest poor contract performance deficiencies in services reports products or other deliverables information security breaches or other aspects of our business could harm our reputation particularly with these agencies due to the sensitive nature of our work and our confidentiality obligations to our customers we may be unable to or limited in our ability to respond to such negative publicity which could also harm our reputation and our business if our reputation is negatively affected certain customers could cease to do business with us and our ability to hire or retain employees and our standing in professional communities to which we contribute and from which we receive expert knowledge could be diminished if any of the foregoing occurs the amount of business with the us government and other customers could decrease and our business future revenues financial condition and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

a decline in the us government budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

revenues under contracts with the dod and us intelligence community either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors represented approximately 49 of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 and 48 of our total revenues for fiscal 2019 and 2018 levels of us government and dod spending are difficult to predict and subject to significant risk laws and plans adopted by the us government relating to along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the us federal budget potential changes in budgetary priorities and defense spending levels sequestration the appropriations process and the permissible federal debt limit could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold including the defense spending priorities of the us presidential administration and congress and what challenges budget reductions will present for us and our industry generally 

current us government spending levels for defenserelated or other programs may not be sustained and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of uncertainty surrounding the federal budget increasing political pressure and legislation shifts in spending priorities from defenserelated or other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors in the event government funding relating to our contracts with the us government or dod becomes unavailable or is reduced or delayed or planned orders are reduced our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the us government or the prime contractor if applicable our operating results could also be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the us government or the dod as well as delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts 

the us government also conducts periodic reviews of us defense strategies and priorities which may shift dod or other budgetary priorities reduce overall us government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defenserelated or other programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues in addition changes to the federal or dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so a significant decline in overall us government spending including in the areas of national security intelligence and homeland security a significant shift in its spending priorities the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defenserelated programs or significant delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations and limit our growth prospects

because we depend on us government contracts a delay in the completion of the us governments budget and appropriation process could delay procurement of the products services and solutions we provide and have an adverse effect on our future revenues 

the funding of us government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriations process in years when the us government does not complete its appropriations before the beginning of the new fiscal year on october 1 government operations are typically funded pursuant to a continuing resolution which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous appropriations cycle but does not authorize new spending initiatives when the us government operates under a continuing resolution delays can occur in the procurement of the products services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being canceled we have from time to time experienced a decline in revenues in our fourth quarter as a result of this annual appropriations cycle and we could experience similar declines in revenues from future delays in the appropriations process when the us government fails to complete its appropriations process or to provide for a continuing resolution a full or partial federal government shutdown may result a federal government shutdown could in turn result in our incurrence of substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts the delay or cancellation of key programs or the delay of contract payments which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results of operations for many programs congress appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years consequently programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations if we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless or until additional funds are obligated to the contract in addition when supplemental appropriations are required to operate the us government or fund specific programs and passage of legislation needed to approve any supplemental appropriations bill is delayed the overall funding environment for our business could be adversely affected 

due to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability 

we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process the us government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a continuing competitive bidding process including gsa schedule and other multiaward contracts which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure the competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us may be split among competitors or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders and to the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win 

following contract award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding any resulting loss or delay of startup and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues andor profitability in addition multiaward contracts require that we make sustained postaward efforts to obtain task orders under the contract as a result we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multiaward contracts we are also experiencing increased competition generally which impacts our ability to obtain contracts see the risk factor “we face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects” our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues andor profitability 

the us government may terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and if we do not replace them this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability 

many of the us government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years these programs are normally funded on an annual basis under our contracts the us government generally has the right to not exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience any decisions by the us government to not exercise contract options or to terminate cancel modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues revenue growth and profitability 

leidos holdings inc annual report  18

we have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts some of our contracts involve the development of complex systems and products to achieve challenging customer goals in a competitive procurement environment as a result we sometimes experience technological or other performance difficulties which have in the past and may in the future result in delays cost overruns and failures in our performance of these contracts if a government customer terminates a contract for default we may be exposed to liability including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and products from another source depending on the nature and value of the contract a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation 

we face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects 

our business is highly competitive and we compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition financial resources and a larger technical staff we also compete with smaller more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas additionally we compete with the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology and the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our success depends on our ability to invest in and develop services and products that address these changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products to remain competitive we must consistently provide superior service technology and performance on a costeffective basis to our customers while understanding customer priorities and maintaining customer relationships our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide including technical qualifications past contract experience geographic presence price and the availability of qualified professional personnel some of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses or establish teaming or other agreements among themselves or third parties that allow them to offer more competitive and comprehensive solutions as a result of such acquisitions or arrangements our current or potential competitors may be able to accelerate the adoption of new technologies that better address customer needs devote greater resources to bring these products and services to market initiate or withstand substantial price competition or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do these competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in fewer orders reduced revenue and margins and loss of market share in addition it is possible that industry consolidation may impact customers’ perceptions of the viability of smaller or even midsize software firms and consequently customers’ willingness to purchase from such firms 

legal and regulatory risks 

our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties including termination of our us government contracts disqualification from bidding on future us government contracts and suspension or debarment from us government contracting 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers such laws and regulations may potentially impose added costs on our business and our failure to comply with them may lead to civil or criminal penalties termination of our us government contracts or suspension or debarment from contracting with federal agencies some significant laws and regulations that affect us include 

• the far and supplements which regulate the formation administration and performance of us government contracts 

• the truth in negotiations act which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations 

• the procurement integrity act which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials 

• the civil false claims act which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the us government for payment or approval 

leidos holdings inc annual report  19

• the false statements act which imposes civil and criminal liability for making false statements to the us government and 

• the us government cas which imposes accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain costbased us government contracts 

for additional background on the regulations that apply to our business and the related compliance risks see “regulation” within item 1 of this annual report on form 10k and the risk factor “our business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and growth prospects 

the far and many of our us government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers organizational conflicts of interest arise when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the us government impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage a conflict of interest issue that precludes our competition for or performance on a significant program or contract could harm our prospects 

the us government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies and recovery of costs among other items us government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors legislation regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of us government agencies such as increased usage of fixedprice contracts multipleaward contracts and small business setaside contracts could have adverse effects on government contractors including us any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when customers recompete those contracts any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues profitability and prospects 

as a us government contractor we and our partners are subject to reviews audits and cost adjustments by the us government which if resolved unfavorably to us could adversely affect our profitability cash position or growth prospects 

us government contractors including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the us government and its agencies including the dcaa dcma the dod inspector general and others these agencies review a contractors performance on government contracts cost structure indirect rates and pricing practices and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations terms and standards as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements they also review the adequacy of the contractor’s compliance with government standards for its business systems including a contractors accounting system earned value management system estimating system materials management and accounting system property management system and purchasing system 

both contractors and the us government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny as a result the current audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome

a finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our us government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and our remediations are accepted by the dcma government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds such adjustments can be applied retroactively which could result in significant customer refunds our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an approved determination of our various business systems from the responsible us government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process a determination of noncompliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations and standards could also result in the us government imposing penalties and sanctions against us including reductions of the value of contracts contract modifications or termination withholding of payments the loss of exportimport privileges administrative or civil judgements and liabilities criminal judgements or convictions liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements other sanctions the assessment of penalties fines or compensatory treble or other damages or nonmonetary relief or actions suspension or debarment suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could negatively impact our reputation delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts perform contracts or compete for contracts with the us government 

as of january 1 2021 indirect cost audits by the dcaa remain open for fiscal 2015 and subsequent fiscal years although we have recorded contract revenues based upon our estimate of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review we cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and if future adjustments exceed our estimates our profitability may be adversely affected 

our business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and growth prospects 

we are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to federal state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside the us if a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities we may be subject to disgorgement of profits fines damages litigation civil or criminal penalties exclusion from sales channels or sales opportunities injunctions or administrative sanctions including the termination of contracts the triggering of price reduction clauses suspension of payments suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies or other consequences we may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry if we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation our revenues profitability cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected more generally increases in scrutiny and investigations from government organizations legislative bodies or agencies into business practices and into major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation revenues profitability and growth prospects 

investigations audits claims disputes enforcement actions litigation arbitration or other legal proceedings could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability and could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims described in note 24—contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k as may be updated in our future filings with the sec including our quarterly reports on form 10q we are also subject to and may become a party to a variety of other litigation claims investigations audits enforcement actions arbitrations or other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation could be costly to defend and even if we are successful or if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future in addition responding to any action may result in a significant diversion of managements attention and resources litigation and other claims including those described in note 24—contingencies are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future

our business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous state federal and international laws and directives and regulations in the us and abroad that involve matters central to our business including data privacy and protection employment and labor relations immigration taxation anticorruption antibribery importexport controls trade restrictions internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation and anticompetition compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources we also conduct business in certain identified growth areas such as health information technology energy and environmental services which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations 

our business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security which could subject us to investigations claims or monetary penalties against us require us to make changes to our business practices or otherwise adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

we are subject to a variety of international federal state and local laws and regulations in the us and abroad relating to privacy data security protection storage retention transfer and disposal technology protection and personal information foreign laws and regulations in these areas can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the us these laws and regulations which depending on the regime may be enforced by private parties or government entities are constantly evolving and may be subject to significant change in the future in addition the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in new and rapidly evolving areas of technology and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices 

as a contractor supporting defense and national security clients we are also subject to certain additional regulatory compliance requirements relating to data privacy and cybersecurity under dfars and other federal regulations certain of our networks and information technology systems are required to comply with the security and privacy controls in national institute of standards and technology special publications to the extent that we do not comply with the applicable security and control requirements unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information could potentially result in a contract termination which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and lead to reputational harm we are also subject to the dod cybersecurity maturity model certification “cmmc” requirements which requires all contractors to receive specific thirdparty certifications relating to specified cybersecurity standards in order to be eligible for contract awards the dod expects that all new contracts will be required to comply with the cmmc by 2026 with initial requests for information beginning in june 2020 and requests for proposal beginning in september 2020 we are in the process of evaluating our readiness and preparing for the cmmc but to the extent we are unable to achieve certification in advance of contract awards that specify the requirement we will be unable to bid on such contract awards or on followon awards for existing work with the dod depending on the level of standard as required for each solicitation which could adversely impact our revenue and profitability in addition any obligations that may be imposed on us under the cmmc may be different from or in addition to those otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations which may cause additional expense for compliance

any failure or perceived failure by us our service providers suppliers subcontractors or other business partners to comply with international federal state or local laws and regulations in these areas could result in regulatory actions or lawsuits against us legal liability fines damages and other costs we may also incur substantial expenses in implementing and maintaining compliance with such laws for example the european unions eu’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which took effect in may 2018 has created new compliance obligations for companies that process data of eu data subjects which require investment into ongoing data protection activities and documentation requirements and creates the potential for significantly increased fines for noncompliance in the us the california consumer protection privacy act of 2018 “ccpa” which took effect on january 1 2020 provides new consumer privacy rights to natural persons residing in california by regulating the processing of personal information of california residents and increasing the obligations on businesses in connection with such activities additionally a new privacy law the california privacy rights act “cpra” was approved by california voters in the election on november 3 2020 and will take effect in most material respects on january 1 2023 the cpra modifies the ccpa significantly including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts it is possible that the ccpa or similar laws now or in the future will be deemed applicable to some aspects of our business which would impose new compliance obligations and require additional investment into privacy law compliance and data protection activities on an ongoing basis any obligations that may be imposed on us under the ccpa the cpra or similar laws may be different from or in addition to those required by the gdpr or other relevant foreign laws which may cause additional expense for compliance across various jurisdictions various us eu and other foreign privacy or data security laws regulations directives policies industry standards or legal obligations that may be relevant to our business also impose obligations to maintain a cybersecurity program at certain levels of quality as well as obligations to give notice to affected individuals and to certain regulators in the event of a data breach 

the overarching complexity of privacy and data security laws and regulations around the world pose a compliance challenge that could manifest in costs damages or liability in other forms as a result of failure to implement proper programmatic controls failure to adhere to those controls or the malicious or inadvertent breach of applicable privacy and data security requirements by us our employees our business partners including our service providers suppliers or subcontractors or our customers we also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws regulations and standards or amendments to or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations industry standards or other obligations may have on our business 

business and operational risks 

the extent to which our business will be adversely affected by covid19 or other health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

the outbreak and global spread of covid19 and the preventative or protective actions that governments corporations individuals and we are taking and may continue to take in an effort to limit the impact of covid19 have resulted in a period of business disruption and increased economic uncertainty the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel access to customer sites employee and contractor remote work and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by covid19 or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions facility closures or other restrictions due to covid19 our operations and results will likely be impacted 

leidos holdings inc annual report  23

government agencies are our primary customers and the longterm impact of increased government spending in response to covid19 is uncertain this could result in a reevaluation of us government spending levels and priorities which could impact our business performance the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and the likelihood of an impact on us that could be material increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the locations in which we operate in particular a delay in wide distribution of vaccines or a lack of public acceptance of vaccines could lead people to continue to selfisolate and not participate in the economy at prepandemic levels for a prolonged period of time further even if vaccines are widely distributed and accepted there can be no assurance that vaccines will ultimately be successful in limiting or stopping the spread of covid19 even after covid19 has subsided we may experience materially adverse impacts on our business as a result of the pandemics global economic impact including any recession that is occurring or may occur in the future for example the global spread of covid19 has resulted in a substantial decline in demand for air travel which has adversely impacted the demand for products and services related to our airport security detection and automation business we are not able to predict whether covid19 will result in permanent changes to air travel behaviors including a permanent reduction in business travel as a result of the increased use of teleconferencing products and more broadly a general reluctance to travel by consumers each of which has and could continue to impact our business further new contract awards have been and may continue to be delayed and our ability to perform on our existing contracts has been and may continue to be delayed or impaired which will negatively impact our revenues in addition our program costs have increased and may continue to increase as a result of covid19 and these cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance or equitable adjustments to contract prices or reimbursement of costs under section 3610 of the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act which could impact our profitability the continued spread of covid19 has had and may continue to have similar negative impacts on our customers subcontractors service providers and suppliers causing delay or limiting their ability to perform including in making timely payments to us any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows the extent to which covid19 impacts our results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and duration of covid19 and actions to contain it or treat its impact among others in addition to the extent covid19 or any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein 

misconduct of employees subcontractors agents suppliers business partners or joint ventures and others working on our behalf could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation 

misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws such as the antikickback act and the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal state or local government procurement regulations regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts laws and regulations relating to environmental health or safety matters bribery of foreign government officials importexport control lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims remediation costs regulatory investigations or sanctions against us corruption or disruption of our systems or those of our customers impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers loss of current and future contracts indemnity obligations serious harm to our reputation and other potential liabilities see also the risk factor “cybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position  ”

although we have implemented policies procedures training and other compliance controls to prevent and detect these activities these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and as a result we could face unknown risks or losses this risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand and do business with new partners in the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures meaning joint efforts or business arrangements of any type we may be unable to prevent misconduct or violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures including their officers directors and employees or our partners our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees subcontractors agents suppliers business partners or joint ventures and others working on our behalf could damage our reputation and subject us to administrative civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions fines and penalties restitution or other damages loss of security clearance loss of current and future customer contracts loss of privileges and other sanctions including suspension or debarment from contracting with federal state or local government agencies any of which would adversely affect our business reputation and our future results 

a failure to attract train retain and motivate skilled employees including our management team would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations 

our business involves the development of tailored services and solutions for our customers a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees our continued success and ability to compete in a highly competitive environment depend on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled science engineering technical math and professional personnel competition for skilled personnel is intense and competitors in our industry and others in the private sector aggressively recruit key employees in addition many us government programs require contractors to have security clearances depending on the level of required clearance security clearances can be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and personnel with security clearances are in great demand particularly in highly specialized areas it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner which may affect our growth although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit train and retain qualified employees we may not be able to attract effectively train and retain these employees any failure to do so could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations efficiently and timely meet our customers’ needs and win new business which could adversely affect our future results in addition certain personnel may be required to receive various security clearances in order to work on certain customer engagements or to perform certain tasks necessary security clearances may be delayed or not obtained which may negatively impact our ability to perform on such engagements contracts in a timely manner or at all 

in addition to attracting and retaining qualified engineering technical and professional personnel we believe that our success will also depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and its ability to retain existing business and generate new business and the continued development of new members of senior management our senior management team is important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of retaining and obtaining customer contracts in our industry particularly with agencies performing classified operations an inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives or our failure to continue to develop new members could cause us to lose customers or new business opportunities 

we may not realize as revenues the full amounts reflected in our backlog which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects 

as of january 1 2021 our total backlog was 319 billion including 66 billion in funded backlog due to the us governments ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our nonus government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances we may realize less than expected revenues or may never realize revenues from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog our unfunded backlog in particular contains management’s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues if we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog our future revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected

our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs time and resources 

we generate revenues under various types of contracts which include costreimbursement fpif tm fploe and ffp contracts our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentivefee and awardfee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts are generally less profitable than ffp contracts our operating results in any period may also be affected positively or negatively by customers variable purchasing patterns of our more profitable proprietary products 

our profitability is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers to varying degrees each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract while ffp contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns revenues from ffp contracts represented approximately 36 of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 when making proposals on these types of contracts we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects as well as assumptions regarding technical issues in each case our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during performance could result and in some instances has resulted in reduced profits or in losses more generally any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in the performance of our contracts including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control such as performance failures of our subcontractors natural disasters or other force majeure events could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable 

we use estimates in recognizing revenues and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues our profitability may be adversely affected 

we recognize revenue on our servicebased contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as we perform the promised services which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known changes in the underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results

cybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position 

as a government contractor and a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies we and our service providers suppliers and subcontractors collect store transmit and otherwise process sensitive information including personally identifiable information protected health information personnel information classified information contractor unclassified information and financial information concerning our business employees and customers therefore we are continuously exposed to unauthorized attempts to compromise such sensitive information through cyberattacks insider threats and other information security threats including physical breakins and malicious insiders any electronic or physical breakin or other security breach or compromise of our information technology systems and networks or facilities or those of our service providers suppliers or subcontractors may jeopardize the security of information stored or transmitted through these systems and networks or stored in those facilities this could lead to disruptions in missioncritical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data or systems we are also increasingly subject to customerdriven cybersecurity certification requirements which are expected to be necessary to win future contracts such security incidents also could result in liability or trigger other obligations under such contracts or increase the difficulty of winning future contracts many statutory requirements both in the us and abroad also include obligations for companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving certain types of data including obligations to notify affected individuals and regulators in the event of security breaches involving certain personal data which could result from breaches experienced by us or our service providers suppliers or subcontractors 

although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to protect against detect and mitigate these threats and attacks we and our service providers suppliers and subcontractors have faced and continue to face advanced and persistent attacks on our information systems we cannot guarantee that future incidents will not occur and if an incident does occur our incident response planning may not prove fully adequate and we may not be able to successfully mitigate the impacts techniques used by others to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to disrupt systems and networks for economic or strategic gain are constantly evolving increasingly sophisticated and increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against these techniques include cyberattacks including covertly introducing ransomware viruses worms or other malware to our computers and networks and denial of service attacks phishing and impersonating authorized users among others and may be perpetrated by internal bad actors such as employees or contractors or by third parties including traditional computer hackers persons involved with wellfunded organized crime or statesponsored efforts 

we seek to detect and investigate all information security incidents and to prevent their occurrence prolongation or recurrence we continue to invest in and improve our threat protection detection and mitigation policies procedures and controls in addition we work with other companies in the industry and government participants on increased awareness and enhanced protections against information security and malicious insider threats however because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats which can be difficult to detect there can be no assurance that our policies procedures and controls or those of our service providers suppliers or subcontractors have protected against detected mitigated or will detect prevent or mitigate any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident we may be currently unaware of certain vulnerabilities or lack the capability to detect them which may allow them to persist in our information technology environment over long periods of time and even if discovered our remediation efforts may not be completely successful 

we also may experience similar security threats to the information technology systems that we develop install or maintain under customer contracts although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners including our service providers suppliers and subcontractors to seek to minimize the potential for and impact of cyberattacks and other security threats we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities see also the risk factor “internal system or service failures or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability  ”

internal system or service failures or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

any system or service disruptions including those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services whether through our shared services organization or outsourced services if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could materially and adversely affect our business including among other things an adverse effect on our ability to perform on contracts bill our customers for work performed on our contracts collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner we and the service providers suppliers and subcontractors on which we rely are also subject to systems failures including network software or hardware failures whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats malicious insiders natural disasters power shortages terrorist attacks pandemics or other events which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business cause us to incur remediation costs subject us to claims and damage our reputation in addition the failure or disruption of our communications or those of our service providers suppliers or subcontractors could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and as a result our future results could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters that could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position 

we have significant operations located in regions that may be exposed to hurricanes earthquakes other damaging storms water levels forest fires and other natural disasters our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract including as a result of disruptions to their workforce and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters and delays in recovery may be significant 

if insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster it could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

many of the systems and networks that we develop install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions while we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions if a system or network that we develop install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats or other events we may experience loss of revenue remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and as a result our future results could be adversely affected

our success depends in part on our ability to work with complex and rapidly changing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 

we design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and in particular by complex and rapidly changing technologies our success depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers our success also depends on our continued access to suppliers of important technologies and components 

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving such contractual requirements failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

in addition our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability such as problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract costs and fee payments we previously received 

if we are unable to work with complex and rapidly changing technologies successfully we may be unable to meet the needs of our customers and our future success revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have contracts with the us government that are classified which may limit investor insight into portions of our business 

we derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the us government and its agencies that are subject to security restrictions eg contracts involving classified information and classified programs which preclude the dissemination of information and technology that is classified for national security purposes under applicable law and regulation in general access to classified information technology facilities or programs requires appropriate personnel security clearances is subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability and may also require appropriate facility clearances and other specialized infrastructure in the event of a security incident involving classified information technology facilities programs or personnel holding clearances we may be subject to legal financial operational and reputational harm we are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result investors have less insight into our classified business or our business overall however historically the business risks associated with our work on classified programs have not differed materially from those of our other government contracts 

we have made and continue to make acquisitions investments joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 

we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures these transactions require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities even if successful these transactions could reduce earnings for a number of reasons including the amortization of intangible assets impairment charges acquired operations that are not yet profitable or the payment of additional consideration under earnout arrangements if an acquisition performs better than expected acquisitions investments and joint ventures pose many other risks that could adversely affect our reputation operations or financial results including 

• we may not be able to identify compete effectively for or complete suitable acquisitions and investments at prices we consider attractive 

• we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions and investments on our business and we may not realize anticipated synergies or acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance

• we may not be able to successfully manage the integration process for acquisitions and the integration process may divert management time and focus from operating our business 

• acquired technologies capabilities products and service offerings particularly those that are still in development when acquired may not perform as expected may have defects or may not be integrated into our business as expected 

• we may have trouble retaining key employees and customers of an acquired business including due to cultural challenges or otherwise integrating such businesses such as incompatible accounting information management or other control systems which could result in unforeseen difficulties 

• we may assume material liabilities that were not identified as part of our due diligence or for which we are unable to receive a purchase price adjustment or reimbursement through indemnification or there may be other unanticipated writeoffs or charges 

• financial reporting revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies of the acquired company that we dont adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect 

• we may need to implement or improve controls procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls procedures and policies 

• we may assume legal or regulatory risks particularly with respect to smaller businesses that have immature business processes and compliance programs or we may face litigation with respect to the acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties 

• acquired entities or joint ventures may not achieve expected business growth or operate profitably which could adversely affect our operating income or operating margins and we may be unable to recover investments in any such acquisitions 

• acquisitions investments and joint ventures may require us to spend a significant amount of cash to incur debt resulting in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in covenants or other restrictions on us or to issue capital stock resulting in dilution of ownership and 

• we may not be able to effectively influence the operations of our joint ventures or we may be exposed to certain liabilities if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations 

if our acquisitions investments or joint ventures fail perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we periodically divest businesses including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan these divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources may disrupt our business distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business including through indemnification guarantee or other financial arrangements for a period of time following the transaction which would adversely affect our financial results

goodwill and other intangible assets represent approximately 60 of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations 

intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition loss of key personnel or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government our primary customer as well as challenges in the commercial healthcare industry compounded by lower levels of us government reimbursements including reductions in medicare reimbursements which in turn impact hospital information technology spending adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions such as the manner in which budget cuts are implemented including sequestration and issues related to the nation’s debt ceiling could adversely impact our future revenues and profitability these circumstances could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles also adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our profitability and financial results 

we depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors if we are not able to maintain these relationships or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer our revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors who are also often our competitors in other contexts in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services and products provided by us and other companies will help us to win and perform the contract our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us or if the us government terminates or reduces these other contractors’ programs does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract companies that do not have access to us government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies’ prospect of securing a future position as a prime us government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts 

we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor customer concerns about the subcontractor our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract our hiring of a subcontractor’s personnel or the subcontractor’s failure to comply with applicable law uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our subcontractors which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us if any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default a termination for default could eliminate a revenue source expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders especially if the customer is an agency of the us government

our services and operations sometimes involve using handling or disposing of hazardous substances which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities 

some of our services and operations involve the assessment or remediation of environmental hazards as well as the use handling or disposal of hazardous substances these activities and our operations generally subject us to extensive foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations which among other things require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances furthermore failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanctions including fines penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government our current and previous ownership and operation of real property also subjects us to environmental protection laws some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property liable for hazardous substance releases even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our inspection or detection systems fail to detect bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats 

we design develop manufacture sell service and maintain various inspection systems and related integration and automation systems that are designed to assist in the detection of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats in some instances we also train operators of such systems such systems utilize software algorithms to interpret data produced by the system and to signal to the operator when a dangerous object or substance may be present such algorithms are probabilistic in nature and are generally designed to meet requirements established by regulatory agencies many of these systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag parcel container vehicle or other vessel others signal to the operator that further investigation is required in either case the training reliability and competence of the customers operator are crucial to the detection of suspicious items nevertheless if such a system were to fail to signal to an operator when an explosive or other contraband was in fact present resulting in significant damage we could become the subject of significant product liability claims 

there are many factors some of which are beyond our control which could result in the failure of our products to help detect the presence of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats some of these factors could include inherent limitations in our systems and misuse or malfunction of our systems the failure of our systems to help detect the presence of any of these dangerous materials could lead to injury death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability professional liability or other claims against us further if our security and inspection systems fail to or are perceived to have failed to help detect a threat we could experience negative publicity and reputational harm which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our insurance customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be insufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims or losses 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits however not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance and for those risks we insure the limits of coverage we purchase or that are reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred if any of our thirdparty insurers fail cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant product and other liability claims or losses moreover there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost if at all if liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage our business financial position operating results and prospects may be harmed regardless of the adequacy of our liability insurance coverages any significant claim may have an adverse effect on our industry and market reputation leading to a substantial decrease in demand for our products and services and reduced revenues

in some circumstances we are entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions laws regulations or otherwise however these protections are not always available can be difficult to obtain are typically subject to certain terms or limitations including the availability of funds and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred 

we face risks associated with our international business 

our international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our us business these risks and challenges include 

• failure to comply with us government and foreign laws and regulations applicable to international business employment privacy data protection information security or data transfer could have an adverse impact on our business with the us government and could expose us to risks and costs of noncompliance with such laws and regulations in addition to administrative civil or criminal penalties 

• us and foreign government import and export control requirements and regulations including international traffic in arms regulations and the antiboycott provisions of the us export administration act technology transfer restrictions and other administrative legislative or regulatory actions that could materially interfere with our ability to offer our products or services in certain countries 

• increased risk for economic legal or political changes that may adversely affect the performance of our services sale of our products or repatriation of our profits 

• international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability imposition of tariffs or additional taxes restrictive trade policies longer payment cycles any delay or failure to collect amounts due to us and differing legal systems 

• we provide services and products in support of us government and other customers in countries with governments that may be or may become unstable which increases the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life damage or destruction of property or inability to meet our contractual obligations and 

• volatility in nonus political and economic environments including by way of examples the potential effects of covid19 and the uks departure from the eu 

in addition we are subject to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar foreign anticorruption laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage our failure to comply with these laws might subject us to civil and criminal penalties that might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

although our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues we are seeking to grow our international business in which case these regulatory geopolitical and other factors may have a greater impact on our business in the future and could adversely affect our business 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success our failure to adequately obtain maintain protect and enforce our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position 

we rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable however trade secrets are difficult to protect and despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights third parties may attempt to obtain copy use or disclose our intellectual property or other proprietary information or technology without our authorization in addition to protection under intellectual property laws we rely on confidentiality or license agreements that we generally enter into with our corporate partners employees consultants advisors service providers suppliers subcontractors and customers and we generally attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information although our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations and use restrictions this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent them from infringing misappropriating or otherwise violating our confidential information technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights furthermore nondisclosure provisions can be difficult to enforce and even if successfully enforced may not be entirely effective 

leidos holdings inc annual report  33 

part i 

we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights we may be required to expend significant resources and efforts to monitor and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights and we may conclude that in at least some instances the benefits of protecting our intellectual property or other proprietary rights may be outweighed by the expense or distraction to our management we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights but outcomes in any such litigation can be difficult to predict any such litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could be timeconsuming result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel if we are unable to detect or prevent third parties from infringing misappropriating or otherwise violating our rights in our patents copyrights trademarks trade secrets or other proprietary rights or information our competitive position could be adversely affected 

in addition in connection with our performance of services for the us government the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts which means that the us government may disclose or license our information to third parties including in some instances our competitors any exercise by the us government of such rights could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

assertions by third parties of infringement misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and could limit our ability to use certain technologies which would result in substantial harm to our business and operating results 

in recent years there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in technology industries in the course of conducting our business we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims against us or our customers or we may face allegations with or without merit that we or our service providers suppliers subcontractors or customers have infringed misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others if with respect to any claim against us for violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights we are unable to prevail in the litigation retain or obtain sufficient rights develop noninfringing solutions or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or costefficient basis our business and competitive position may be adversely affected such claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third partys intellectual property rights in addition our contracts generally indemnify our customers for thirdparty claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide besides the expense of defending such claims and the cost of any large indemnity payments any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations also could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers any of which could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks relating to our stock 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

in march 2012 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend program the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results and capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor 

some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares these restrictions which may also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors not endorsed by our current directors and management include the following 

• our certificate of incorporation contains a provision that mergers and certain other business combinations between us and a related person be approved by the holders of a majority of the voting power of such securities that are not owned by the related person unless approved by a majority of continuing directors or certain other exceptions 

• our stockholders may not act by written consent as a result a holder or holders controlling a majority of our capital stock are limited in their ability to take certain actions other than in connection with its annual stockholders meeting or a special meeting called at the request of qualified stockholders as provided in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

• our board of directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock the ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us 

as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain restrictions on business combinations under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things our board of directors has approved the business combination or the transaction pursuant to which such person became a 15 holder prior to the time the person became a 15 holder

sales trend for fiscal 2020 revenues increased 12 billion or 11 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to revenues related to the acquisitions of dynetics inc dynetics and l3harris technologies security detection and automation businesses the sda businesses program wins and a net increase in volumes on certain programs this was partially offset by the completion of certain contracts negative impacts on certain contracts due to covid19 and the impact of the sale of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses in the prior year for fiscal 2019 revenues increased 900 million or 9 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to program wins and a net increase in program volumes partially offset by programs ended and the impact of the sale of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses see results of operations below for discussion of our individual segment results 

operating expenses and income trend for fiscal 2020 operating expenses increased by 11 billion or 11 compared to fiscal 2019 operating margin for fiscal 2020 was 81 compared to 82 for fiscal 2019 operating income was 998 million an 86 million increase compared to fiscal 2019 the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to program wins income related to the acquisitions of dynetics and the sda businesses and a net gain recognized upon the receipt of proceeds related to the virnetx inc virnetx legal matter this was partially offset by negative impacts on certain contracts due to covid19 a net gain recognized in the prior year upon the receipt of the greek arbitration award and increases in acquisition and integration costs and amortization expenses primarily associated with our current year acquisitions

from a macroeconomic perspective our industry is under general competitive pressures associated with spending from our largest customer the us government and requires a high level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive although the administration has not indicated a desire to reduce spending in the defense and homeland security sectors the likelihood extent and duration of current spending levels in these areas remains unclear we continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary 

covid19 

the covid19 pandemic is affecting major economic and financial markets and effectively all industries and governments are facing challenges which has resulted in a period of business disruption the length and severity of which cannot be predicted the pandemic has resulted in significant travel restrictions government orders to “shelterinplace” quarantine restrictions and significant disruption of the financial markets we have acted to protect the health and safety of our employees comply with workplace health and safety regulations and work with our customers to minimize disruptions the pandemic has impacted each of our groups primarily in access to customer sites travel restrictions limitations of remote work and covid19 related costs 

consistent with federal state and local guidance we perform work that is essential to support the critical infrastructure of the united states the defense industrial base and healthcare sector and we continue to operate in support of our customers we have taken steps to support increased teleworking and safe workplace environments we have some minor business operations that are not designated as critical infrastructure and therefore have been required to operate in minimal conditions 

for fiscal 2020 covid19 adversely impacted revenues by approximately 198 million and impacted operating income by approximately 96 million as compared to prior year results the full extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance including our ability to execute on programs in the expected timeframe will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic and the distribution and efficacy of vaccines all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted while we have been able to make some recoveries the ultimate timing and amount of recoveries remain uncertain as they will depend on a range of government actions including each government agency andor contracting officers implementation of the authority granted in section 3610 of the cares act a 2 trillion coronavirus response bill providing widespread emergency relief including the availability of funds as a result of congress passing government fiscal year gfy 2021 appropriations the relief from the cares act has been extended until march 31 2021 

we have experienced delays and expect to continue experiencing delays on certain contracts as a result of standby leave absences which has caused a portion of our contracts to be less profitable within our health segment we saw recoveries in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and continue to expect to see further recoveries in fiscal 2021 our defense solutions reportable segment experienced less of a negative impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 than in previous quarters we also experienced lower indirect expenditures for fiscal 2020 as a result of covid19 which partially offset the operating income impact on our programs we are seeking reimbursement of some of the covid19 related costs under our us government contracts through a combination of equitable adjustments to the contract prices and reimbursement of the costs under section 3610 which allows but does not require federal agencies to reimburse contractors at the minimum applicable contract billing rate for costs arising from certain paid leave including sick leave a contractor provides to keep its employees or subcontractors in a ready state including to protect the life and safety of government and contractor personnel reimbursement of any costs under section 3610 increases sales but does not include a profit or fee and has the effect of reducing our margins standby cost increases including costs for employees whose jobs cannot be performed remotely may not be fully recoverable under our contracts particularly fixedprice contracts we also have no assurance that congress will appropriate funds to cover the reimbursement of defense contractors authorized by the cares act which could reduce funds available for recovery of these costs or for other us government defense priorities 

the cares act also enabled us to defer payment of the employer portion of social security taxes as of january 1 2021 we deferred 123 million of employer social security tax payments and received 12 million from the employee retention credit 

we have taken measures to protect the health and wellbeing of our workforce and are working with our customers to minimize the delay and disruption of the award and performance on our contracts many of our employees continue to work remotely while our offices remain open with limited capacity

business environment and trends 

us government markets 

in fiscal 2020 we generated approximately 87 of our total revenues from contracts with the us government either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government revenues under contracts with the dod and us intelligence community including subcontracts under which the dod or the us intelligence community is the ultimate purchaser represented approximately 49 of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 accordingly our business performance is affected by the overall level of us government spending especially national security homeland security and intelligence spending and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the us government 

on february 10 2020 the president submitted the gfy 2021 budget proposal to congress which included discretionary spending levels for defense and nondefense programs of 741 billion and 590 billion respectively shortly after the budget release congress and the administration shifted their collective attention to mitigating the impact of covid19 

prior to the beginning of gfy 2021 congress passed a continuing resolution cr that was enacted on october 1 2020 to provide temporary funding for government operations at gfy 2020 enacted levels until december 11 2020 a series of shortterm crs were subsequently passed to extend temporary funding until the passage of gfy 2021 appropriations on december 20 2020 congress reached agreement on a comprehensive gfy 2021 appropriations package and on december 27 2020 the president signed the 14 trillion appropriations deal 

with the enactment of gfy 2021 spending levels attention now turns to additional covid19 relief immediately following that effort will be submission of a gfy 2021 supplemental aimed at economic recovery completing action on these proposals may delay the presidents gfy 2022 budget request which is not expected to be submitted to congress until late april or early may 

trends in the us government contracting process including a shift towards multipleawards contracts in which certain contractors are preapproved using indefinitedeliveryindefinitequantity idiq and us general services administration gsa contract vehicles have increased competition for us government contracts reduced backlogs by shortening periods of performance on contracts and increased pricing pressure we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process for more information on these risks and uncertainties see “risk factors” in part i of this annual report on form 10k 

international markets 

sales to customers in international markets represented 8 of total revenues for fiscal 2020 our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory foreign currency exchange rate and geopolitical risks 

changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials may increase our procurement costs of certain it hardware used both on our contracts and for internal use however we expect to recover certain portions of these higher tariffs through our costplus contracts while we evaluate the impact of higher tariffs currently we do not expect tariffs to have a significant impact to our business 

key performance measures 

the primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue operating income cash flows from operations and diluted earnings per share bookings and backlog are also useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our performance and potential future revenues in addition we consider business performance by contract type to be useful to management and investors when evaluating our operating income and margin performance

we have certain noncontrolling ownership interests in equity method investments for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 we recorded earnings of 16 million 29 million and 28 million respectively from our equity method investments partially offset by amortization of 2 million  11 million and 10 million respectively 

nonoperating expense net 

nonoperating expense net increased 171 million for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the 88 million gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business in the prior year 36 million of debt discount and deferred financing costs written off and higher interest expense associated with increases in our longterm debt related to the financing of the acquisitions of dynetics and the sda businesses 

nonoperating expense net decreased 93 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the 88 million gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 195 226 and 46 in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was favorably impacted primarily by federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions partially offset by taxes related to foreign operations 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was favorably impacted primarily by excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions and federal research tax credits partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances arising from foreign withholding tax and an increase in taxes related to the sale of the commercial cybersecurity business 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted primarily by a decrease in valuation allowances arising from the taxable conversion of a subsidiary and the utilization of capital losses an increase in deferred tax assets related to the stock basis of a subsidiary held for sale excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions and federal research tax credits

noncontrolling interest 

we have an 88 controlling interest in mission support alliance llc msa a joint venture with centerra group llc which is anticipated to end in early fiscal 2021 we also have a 53 controlling interest in hanford mission integration solutions llc hmis the legal entity for the followon contract to msas contract and a joint venture with centerra group llc and parsons government services inc we include the financial results for msa and hmis in our consolidated financial statements net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was 1 million for fiscal 2020 and 2018 and 3 million for fiscal 2019 

bookings and backlog 

we had net bookings of 178 billion and 145 billion during fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenue to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards that were received during the year net of any adjustments to previously awarded backlog amounts we calculate net bookings as the year’s ending backlog plus the year’s revenues less the prior year’s ending backlog and any impacts from foreign currency or acquisitions and divestitures 

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts we segregate our backlog into two categories as follows 

• funded backlog funded backlog for contracts with the us government represents the value on contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts funded backlog for contracts with nonus government entities and commercial customers represents the estimated value on contracts which may cover multiple future years under which we are obligated to perform less revenues previously recognized on the contracts 

• negotiated unfunded backlog negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from contracts for which funding has not been appropriated and unexercised priced contract options negotiated unfunded backlog does not include unexercised option periods and future potential task orders expected to be awarded under idiq gsa schedule or other master agreement contract vehicles with the exception of certain idiq contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded and separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future anticipated task orders 

the estimated value of our total backlog for the periods presented was as follows 



leidos holdings inc annual report  46

the change in backlog for the defense solutions and civil reportable segments reflect 1632 million and 574 million respectively of backlog acquired as a result of the acquisitions of dynetics and the sda businesses respectively see note 6—acquisitions of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

bookings and backlog fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards renewals modifications and cancellations as well as foreign currency movements contract awards may be negatively impacted by ongoing industrywide delays in procurement decisions and budget cuts by the us government as discussed in “business environment and trends” in this annual report on form 10k 

we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus government customers may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed 

contract types 

our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract for a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenues see “business—contract types” in part i of this annual report on form 10k revenues by contract type as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods presented were as follows

critical accounting policies 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates and assumptions have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

• revenue recognition 

• goodwill and intangible assets 

• income taxes 

leidos holdings inc annual report  51 

part ii 

revenue recognition 

our revenues from contracts with customers are from offerings including digital modernization cyber operations mission software systems integrated systems and mission operations primarily with the us government and its agencies we also serve various state and local governments foreign governments and commercial customers 

we perform under various types of contracts which include firmfixedprice ffp timeandmaterials tm fixedpricelevelofeffort fploe costplusfixedfee cpff costplusawardfee costplusincentivefee and fixedpriceincentivefee contracts 

to determine the proper revenue recognition we first evaluate whether we have a duly approved and enforceable contract with a customer in which the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified and collectability is probable we also evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract including the task orders issued under an idiq award in addition we assess contract modifications to determine whether changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract contract modifications generally relate to changes in contract specifications and requirements and do not add distinct services and therefore are accounted for as part of the original contract if contract modifications add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by an amount that reflects the standalone selling price those modifications are accounted for as separate contracts 

most of our contracts are comprised of multiple promises including the design and build of softwarebased systems integration of hardware and software solutions running and maintaining of it infrastructure and procurement services in all cases we assess if the multiple promises should be accounted for as separate performance obligations or combined into a single performance obligation we generally separate multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct both individually and in the context of the contract if multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or require significant integration or customization within a group they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation 

our contracts with the us government often contain options to renew existing contracts for an additional period of time generally a year at a time under the same terms and conditions as the original contract and generally do not provide the customer any material rights under the contract we account for renewal options as separate contracts when they include distinct goods or services at standalone selling prices 

contracts with the us government are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far and priced on estimated or actual costs of providing the goods or services the far provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the us government and its agencies each contract is competitively priced and bid separately pricing for nonus government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer in circumstances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable we estimate the standalone selling price using the expected costplus margin approach any taxes collected or imposed when determining the transaction price are excluded 

certain costplus and fixedprice contracts contain award fees incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion we estimate variable consideration at the most probable amount that we expect to be entitled to based on the assessment of the contractual variable fee criteria complexity of work and related risks extent of customer discretion amount of variable consideration received historically and the potential of significant reversal of revenue 

we allocate the transaction price of a contract to its performance obligations in the proportion of its respective standalone selling prices the standalone selling price of the performance obligations is generally based on an expected costplus margin approach in accordance with the far for certain product sales prices from other standalone sales are used substantially all of our contracts do not contain a significant financing component which would require an adjustment to the transaction price of the contract 

leidos holdings inc annual report  52 

part ii 

we recognize revenue on our servicebased contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as the promised services are performed for us government contracts continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any workinprocess similarly for nonus government contracts the customer typically controls the workinprocess as evidenced by rights to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services for which we do not have an alternate use anticipated losses on servicebased contracts are recognized when incurred generally on a straightline basis over the contract term in certain product sales where the products have an alternate use revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer takes control of the asset usually denoted by possession and legal title 

on ffp contracts requiring system integration and costplus contracts with variable consideration revenue is recognized over time generally using a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation principally using a costinput method referred to as the costtocost method under the costtocost method revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costsatcompletion eac a performance obligations eac includes all direct costs such as materials labor subcontract costs overhead and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs in addition an eac of a performance obligation includes future losses estimated to be incurred on onerous contracts as and when known on certain other contracts principally tm fploe and cpff revenue is recognized using the righttoinvoice practical expedient as we are contractually able to invoice the customer based on the control transferred to the customer additionally on maintenance generally ffp performance obligations revenue is recognized over time using a straightline method as the control of the services is provided to the customer evenly over the period of performance 

for certain performance obligations where we are not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or service to the customer do not have inventory risk and do not have discretion in establishing the price for the goods or service we recognize revenue on a net basis 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date we recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date 

goodwill and intangible assets net collectively represent 60 and 58 of our total assets as of january 1 2021 and january 3 2020 respectively 

goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level and tested more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year during fiscal 2020 and 2019 we had seven and six reporting units respectively for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment 

estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and intangibles requires the exercise of significant judgment and assumptions including judgments about expected future cash flows weightedaverage cost of capital discount rates and expected longterm growth rates in some cases we use discounted cash flow analyses which are based on estimates of future sales earnings and cash flows after considering such factors as general market conditions customer budgets existing firm and future orders changes in working capital long term business plans and recent operating performance a significant change to these estimates and assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units and intangible assets to decline and increase the risk of an impairment charge to earnings intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

leidos holdings inc annual report  53 

part ii 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with the accounting standard for income taxes the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities under this method changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in income in the period such changes are enacted 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes 

the provision for federal state foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination and settlement with various taxing authorities liabilities for uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our income tax expense

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the normal course of business our current market risk exposures are primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments contains forwardlooking statements 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to longterm debt obligations and derivatives our policy authorizes with board of directors approval the limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific interest rate risks 

debt and derivatives 

at january 1 2021 and january 3 2020 we had 47 billion and 30 billion respectively of longterm debt which included 14 billion and 19 billion respectively related to our senior unsecured term loans that have a variable stated interest rate that is determined based on the london interbank offered rate libor rate plus a margin as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense 

we have interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows of a portion of our variable rate senior unsecured term loan variable rate loan under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements we receive variable interest payments based on the onemonth libor rate and pay interest at a fixed rate during fiscal 2018 we terminated our existing interest rate swaps and entered into new interest rate swap agreements which mature in august 2025 and have a fixed interest rate of 300 to hedge the cash flows of 15 billion of our variable rate loan as of january 1 2021 the notional value of the interest rate swap agreements was 11 billion the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our variable rate borrowing to a fixed rate borrowing as of january 1 2021 and january 3 2020 the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements with respect to our variable rate loan was a liability of 103 million and 75 million respectively 

leidos holdings inc annual report  54 

part ii 

the counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we cannot predict future market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our interest rate swaps the net hypothetical 10 movement in the onemonth libor rate would not have a significant impact on our annual interest expense for additional information related to our interest rate swap agreements and debt see note 14—derivative instruments and note 15—debt respectively of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of january 1 2021 and january 3 2020 our cash and cash equivalents included investments in several large institutional money market accounts for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 a hypothetical 10 interest rate movement would not have a significant impact on the value of our holdings or on interest income 

foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars some of our transactions are denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our or one of our subsidiaries functional currency our foreign operations represented 8 of total revenues for fiscal 2020 and 2019 and 9 of total revenues for fiscal 2018

in connection with the performance of services and solutions the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under us governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts generally the us government may disclose or license such information to third parties including in some instances our competitors in the case of some subcontracts that we perform the prime contractor generally obtains rights to use the programs and products that we deliver under the subcontract to perform its prime contract obligations 

competition 

competition for contracts is significant and we often compete against a large number of wellestablished corporations that may have greater name and brand recognition we also compete against smaller more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas as well as the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers as a result of the diverse requirements of the us government and our commercial customers we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations

we compete on various factors including our technical expertise and qualified professional andor securitycleared personnel our ability to deliver innovative costeffective solutions in a timely manner successful program execution our reputation and standing with customers pricing the size and geographic presence of our company and past performance credentials 

contract procurement 

our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government and other contracts the us government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives today us government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many us government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or prequalify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through singleaward contracts the predominant contracting methods through which us government agencies procure services and products include the following 

 

leidos holdings inc annual report  6 

part i 

 we often partner with other companies including our competitors to submit bids for large us government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract our relationships with our partners including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program contract or customer requirements as well as the relative size qualifications capabilities customer relationships and experience of our company and our partners 

contracting with the us government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks including the us government’s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the us government issues a termination for convenience these regulations and risks are described in more detail below under business–regulation and risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

contract types 

generally the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the us government and may depend on certain factors including the type and complexity of the work to be performed degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals we generate revenues under several types of contracts including the following 



leidos holdings inc annual report  7 

part i 

 our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract and the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentivefee and awardfee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts generally have lower profitability than ffp contracts 

backlog 

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed our backlog consists of funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog backlog includes priced option periods not yet exercised we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog from us government customers as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus federal government customers included in funded backlog may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time many of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed for additional discussion and analysis of backlog see results of operations—bookings and backlog in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

the us governments fiscal year ends on september 30 of each year while not certain it is not uncommon for us government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter in addition our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter we tend to generate less revenue from our labor services during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season for selected quarterly financial data see selected quarterly financial data in part ii of this annual report on form 10k

regulation 

we are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate we provide services and products to numerous us government agencies and entities including to the dod the us intelligence community and the dhs when working with these and other us government agencies and entities we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of contracts us government contracts generally are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far which sets forth policies procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the us government agencyspecific regulations that implement or supplement the far such as the department of defense federal acquisition regulation supplement and other applicable laws and regulations these regulations impose a broad range of requirements many of which are unique to government contracting including various procurement import and export security contract pricing and cost contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements among other things these laws and regulations 

 the us government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time in order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance trainings relevant to their position

 item 1a risk factors 

in your evaluation of our company and business you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed and the price of our stock could decline our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as our ability to collect receivables overall us and global economic and industry conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest and exchange rates terrorism international conflicts major health concerns climate change or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially harm our business financial condition or operating results and result in a decline in the price of our stock 

risks relating to our business 

we depend on government agencies as our primary customers and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected 

we generated 87  85 and 84 of our total revenues during fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively from contracts with the us government including all branches of the us military either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government we generated more than 10 of our total revenues during fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017 from the us army we expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under us government contracts our reputation and relationship with the us government and in particular with the agencies of the dod and the us intelligence community are key factors in maintaining and growing our revenues negative press reports or publicity which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct conflicts of interest poor contract performance deficiencies in services reports products or other deliverables information security breaches or other aspects of our business regardless of accuracy could harm our reputation particularly with these agencies if our reputation is negatively affected or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected 

a decline in the us government budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

revenues under contracts with the dod and us intelligence community either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors represented approximately 48 of our total revenues for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  levels of us government and dod spending are difficult to predict and subject to significant risk our operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the us government or the dod as well as delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts current us government spending levels for defenserelated or other programs may not be sustained and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of uncertainty surrounding the federal budget increasing political pressure and legislation shifts in spending priorities from defenserelated or other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors 

the us government also conducts periodic reviews of us defense strategies and priorities which may shift dod or other budgetary priorities reduce overall us government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defenserelated or other programs including programs from which we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues in addition changes to the federal or dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so a significant decline in overall us government spending including in the areas of national security intelligence and homeland security a significant shift in its spending priorities the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defenserelated programs or significant delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

leidos holdings inc annual report  11 

part i 

because we depend on us government contracts a delay in the completion of the us governments budget and appropriation process could delay procurement of the products services and solutions we provide and have an adverse effect on our future revenues 

the funding of us government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriations process in years when the us government does not complete its appropriations before the beginning of the new fiscal year on october 1 government operations are typically funded pursuant to a continuing resolution which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous appropriations cycle but does not authorize new spending initiatives when the us government operates under a continuing resolution delays can occur in the procurement of the products services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being canceled we have from time to time experienced a decline in revenues in our fourth quarter as a result of this annual appropriations cycle and we could experience similar declines in revenues from future delays in the appropriations process when the us government fails to complete its appropriations process or to provide for a continuing resolution a full or partial federal government shutdown may result a federal government shutdown could in turn result in our incurrence of substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts the delay or cancellation of key programs or the delay of contract payments which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results in addition when supplemental appropriations are required to operate the us government or fund specific programs and passage of legislation needed to approve any supplemental appropriations bill is delayed the overall funding environment for our business could be adversely affected 

our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties including termination of our us government contracts disqualification from bidding on future us government contracts and suspension or debarment from us government contracting 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business some significant statutes and regulations that affect us include 

 the far and many of our us government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers organizational conflicts of interest arise when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the us government impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage a conflict of interest issue that precludes our competition for or performance on a significant program or contract could harm our prospects 

leidos holdings inc annual report  12 

part i 

the us government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies and recovery of costs among other items us government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors legislation regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of us government agencies such as increased usage of fixedprice contracts multipleaward contracts and small business setaside contracts could have adverse effects on government contractors including us any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when those contracts are recompeted any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues profitability and prospects 

our business is subject to reviews audits and cost adjustments by the us government which if resolved unfavorably to us could adversely affect our profitability cash position or growth prospects 

us government agencies including the dcaa dcma and others routinely audit and review a contractors performance on government contracts indirect rates and pricing practices and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations and standards they also review the adequacy of the contractor’s compliance with government standards for its business systems including a contractors accounting system earned value management system estimating system materials management and accounting system property management system and purchasing system 

both contractors and the us government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny as a result the current audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome 

a finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our us government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and our remediations are accepted by dcma government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds such adjustments can be applied retroactively which could result in significant customer refunds our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an approved determination of our various business systems from the responsible us government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process a determination of noncompliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations and standards could also result in the us government imposing penalties and sanctions against us including withholding of payments suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts perform contracts or compete for contracts with the us government 

as of january 3 2020  indirect cost audits by the dcaa remain open for fiscal 2013 and subsequent fiscal years although we have recorded contract revenues based upon our estimate of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review we cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and if future adjustments exceed our estimates our profitability may be adversely affected

our business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and growth prospects 

we are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to federal state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside the united states if a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions including the termination of contracts forfeiture of profits the triggering of price reduction clauses suspension of payments fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies we may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry if we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation our revenues profitability cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected more generally increases in scrutiny and investigations from government organizations legislative bodies or agencies into business practices and into major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation revenues profitability and growth prospects 

misconduct of employees subcontractors agents and business partners could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation 

misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws including for example the antikickback act other examples could include the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal state or local government procurement regulations regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts laws and regulations relating to environmental health or safety matters bribery of foreign government officials importexport control lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims remediation costs regulatory sanctions against us loss of current and future contracts and serious harm to our reputation although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and as a result we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees subcontractors agents or business partners could damage our reputation and subject us to fines and penalties restitution or other damages loss of security clearance loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal state or local government agencies any of which would adversely affect our business reputation and our future results 

due to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability 

we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process the us government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a continuing competitive bidding process including idiq gsa schedule and other multiaward contracts which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure the competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders and to the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win following contract award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding any resulting loss or delay of startup and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues andor profitability in addition multiaward contracts require that we make sustained postaward efforts to obtain task orders under the contract as a result we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multiaward contracts our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues andor profitability

the us government may terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and if we do not replace them this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability 

many of the us government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years these programs are normally funded on an annual basis under our contracts the us government generally has the right to not exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience any decisions by the us government to not exercise contract options or to terminate cancel modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues revenue growth and profitability 

we have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts some of our contracts involve the development of complex systems and products to achieve challenging customer goals in a competitive procurement environment as a result we sometimes experience technological or other performance difficulties which have in the past and may in the future result in delays cost overruns and failures in our performance of these contracts if a government customer terminates a contract for default we may be exposed to liability including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and products from another source depending on the nature and value of the contract a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation 

we face aggressive competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects 

our business is highly competitive and we compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition financial resources and a larger technical staff we also compete with smaller more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas additionally we compete with the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology and the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address these changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products to remain competitive we must consistently provide superior service technology and performance on a costeffective basis to our customers our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide including technical qualifications past contract experience geographic presence price and the availability of qualified professional personnel in addition our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers’ needs accordingly we anticipate that larger or new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge which may adversely affect our ability to compete 

a failure to attract train and retain skilled employees including our management team would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations 

our business involves the development of tailored services and solutions for our customers a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees our continued success depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled engineering technical and professional personnel competition for skilled personnel is intense and competitors aggressively recruit key employees in addition many us government programs require contractors to have security clearances depending on the level of required clearance security clearances can be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and personnel with security clearances are in great demand particularly in highly specialized areas it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner which may affect our growth although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit train and retain qualified employees we may not be able to attract effectively train and retain these employees any failure to do so could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations efficiently and timely meet our customers’ needs and win new business which could adversely affect our future results 

leidos holdings inc annual report  15 

part i 

in addition to attracting and retaining qualified engineering technical and professional personnel we believe that our success will also depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and its ability to retain existing business and generate new business our senior management team is important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of retaining and obtaining customer contracts in our industry particularly with agencies performing classified operations an inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives could cause us to lose customers or new business opportunities 

we may not realize as revenues the full amounts reflected in our backlog which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects 

as of january 3 2020  our total backlog was 241 billion  including 54 billion in funded backlog due to the us governments ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our nonus government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances we may realize less than expected or may never realize revenues from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog our unfunded backlog in particular contains management’s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues if we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog our future revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs time and resources 

we generate revenues under various types of contracts which include costreimbursement fpif tm fploe and ffp contracts our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentivefee and awardfee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts are generally less profitable than ffp contracts our operating results in any period may also be affected positively or negatively by customers variable purchasing patterns of our more profitable proprietary products 

our profitability is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers to varying degrees each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract while ffp contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns revenues from ffp contracts represented approximately 33 of our total revenues for fiscal 2019  when making proposals on these types of contracts we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects as well as assumptions regarding technical issues in each case our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during performance could result and in some instances has resulted in reduced profits or in losses more generally any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in the performance of our contracts including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control such as performance failures of our subcontractors natural disasters or other force majeure events could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable 

we use estimates in recognizing revenues and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues our profitability may be adversely affected 

we recognize revenue on our servicebased contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as we perform the promised services which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known changes in the underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results

legal disputes could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability and could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims described in legal proceedings in part i of this annual report on form 10k as may be updated in our future filings with the sec including our quarterly reports on form 10q we are also subject to and may become a party to a variety of other litigation or claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation could be costly to defend and even if we are successful or if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future litigation and other claims including those described in legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future 

our business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous federal state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection employment and labor relations immigration taxation anticorruption importexport controls trade restrictions internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation and anticompetition compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources we also conduct business in certain identified growth areas such as health information technology energy and environmental services which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations 

information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results or cause harm to our reputation or competitive position 

as a government contractor and a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies we and our suppliers and subcontractors process andor store sensitive information including personally identifiable information protected health information personnel information classified information contractor unclassified information and financial information concerning our business employees and customers therefore we are continuously exposed to unauthorized attempts to compromise such sensitive information through cyberattacks insider threats and other information security threats including physical breakins and malicious insiders any electronic or physical breakin or other security breach or compromise may jeopardize security of information stored or transmitted through our information technology systems and networks this could lead to disruptions in missioncritical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data or systems we are also increasingly subject to customerdriven cybersecurity certification requirements which are expected to be necessary to win future contracts 

although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to protect against detect and mitigate these threats we face advanced and persistent attacks on our information systems attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information are constantly evolving increasingly sophisticated and increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against these attempts include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others and may be perpetrated by wellfunded organized crime or statesponsored efforts 

leidos holdings inc annual report  17 

part i 

we seek to detect and investigate all information security incidents and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence we continue to invest in and improve our threat protection detection and mitigation policies procedures and controls in addition we work with other companies in the industry and government participants on increased awareness and enhanced protections against information security and malicious insider threats however because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats which can be difficult to detect there can be no assurance that our policies procedures and controls have detected or will detect or prevent any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident we may be currently unaware of certain vulnerabilities or lack the capability to detect them which may allow them to persist in our it environment over long periods of time 

we may experience similar security threats to the information technology systems that we develop install or maintain under customer contracts although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners including our suppliers and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber and other security threats we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber or other security threats may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means occurrence of any of these security threats could disrupt our systems or those of our customers impair our ability to provide services to our customers result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information and as a result  expose us to claims contract terminations and damages and could adversely affect our reputation ability to win work on sensitive us government contracts business operations and financial results 

internal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

any system or service disruptions including those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services whether through our shared services organization or outsourced services if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business including among other things an adverse effect on our ability to perform on contracts bill our customers for work performed on our contracts collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner we are also subject to systems failures including network software or hardware failures whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats malicious insiders natural disasters power shortages terrorist attacks or other events which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business cause us to incur remediation costs subject us to claims and damage our reputation in addition the failure or disruption of our communications could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and as a result our future results could be adversely affected 

customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

many of the systems and networks that we develop install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions while we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions if a system or network that we develop install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats or other events we may experience loss of revenue remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and as a result our future results could be adversely affected 

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

we design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements

in addition our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability such as problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract costs and fee payments we previously received 

we have contracts with the us government that are classified which may limit investor insight into portions of our business 

we derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the us government that are subject to security restrictions classified programs which preclude the dissemination of information that is classified for national security purposes we are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business 

we have made and continue to make acquisitions investments joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 

we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures these transactions require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities even if successful these transactions could reduce earnings for a number of reasons including the amortization of intangible assets impairment charges acquired operations that are not yet profitable or the payment of additional consideration under earnout arrangements if an acquisition performs better than expected acquisitions investments and joint ventures pose many other risks that could adversely affect our reputation operations or financial results including 

 if our acquisitions investments or joint ventures fail perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

leidos holdings inc annual report  19

in addition we periodically divest businesses including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan these divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources may disrupt our business distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business including through indemnification guarantee or other financial arrangements for a period of time following the transaction which would adversely affect our financial results 

goodwill and other intangible assets represent approximately 58 of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations 

intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition loss of key personnel or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government our primary customer as well as challenges in the commercial healthcare industry compounded by lower levels of us government reimbursements including reductions in medicare reimbursements which in turn impact hospital it spending adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions such as the manner in which budget cuts are implemented including sequestration and issues related to the nation’s debt ceiling could adversely impact our future revenues and profitability these circumstances could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles also adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our profitability and financial results 

we depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors if we are not able to maintain these relationships or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer our revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors who are also often our competitors in other contexts in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services and products provided by us and other companies will help us to win and perform the contract our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us or if the us government terminates or reduces these other contractors’ programs does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract companies that do not have access to us government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies’ prospect of securing a future position as a prime us government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts 

we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor customer concerns about the subcontractor our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract our hiring of a subcontractor’s personnel or the subcontractor’s failure to comply with applicable law uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our subcontractors which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us if any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default a termination for default could eliminate a revenue source expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders especially if the customer is an agency of the us government

our services and operations sometimes involve using handling or disposing of hazardous substances which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities 

some of our services and operations involve the assessment or remediation of environmental hazards as well as the use handling or disposal of hazardous substances these activities and our operations generally subject us to extensive foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations which among other things require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances furthermore failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanctions including fines penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government our current and previous ownership and operation of real property also subjects us to environmental protection laws some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property liable for hazardous substance releases even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our inspection or detection systems fail to detect bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats 

we design develop manufacture sell service and maintain various inspection systems and related integration and automation systems that are designed to assist in the detection of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats in some instances we also train operators of such systems many of these systems utilize software algorithms that are probabilistic in nature and subject to significant technical limitations many of these systems are also dependent on the performance of their operators there are many factors some of which are beyond our control which could result in the failure of our products to help detect the presence of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats some of these factors could include operator error inherent limitations in our systems and misuse or malfunction of our systems the failure of our systems to help detect the presence of any of these dangerous materials could lead to injury death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability professional liability or other claims against us further if our systems fail to or are perceived to have failed to help detect a threat the negative publicity from such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims or losses 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits however not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance and for those risks we insure the limits of coverage we purchase or that are reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred if any of our thirdparty insurers fail cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant product and other liability claims or losses moreover there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost if at all if liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage our business financial position operating results and prospects may be harmed regardless of the adequacy of our liability insurance coverages any significant claim may have an adverse effect on our industry and market reputation leading to a substantial decrease in demand for our products and services and reduced revenues 

we face risks associated with our international business 

our international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our us business failure to comply with us government and foreign laws and regulations applicable to international business such as the foreign corrupt practices act or us export control regulations could have an adverse impact on our business with the us government and could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties additionally these risks relating to international operations may expose us to potentially significant contract losses

in some countries there is an increased chance for economic legal or political changes that may adversely affect the performance of our services sale of our products or repatriation of our profits international transactions can also involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability imposition of tariffs or additional taxes restrictive trade policies any delay or failure to collect amounts due to us and differing legal systems we provide services and products in support of us government customers in countries with governments that may be or may become unstable which increases the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life damage or destruction of property or inability to meet our contractual obligations although our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues we are seeking to grow our international business in which case these regulatory geopolitical and other factors may have a greater impact on our business in the future and could adversely affect our business 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success our failure to adequately protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position 

we rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable however trade secrets are difficult to protect although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights trademarks or other proprietary information our competitive position could be adversely affected in addition in connection with the performance of services the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts which means that the us government may disclose or license our information to third parties including in some instances our competitors 

in the course of conducting our business we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims against us or our customers our contracts generally indemnify our customers for thirdparty claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide the expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results 

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod 

our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control for these reasons comparing our operating results on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance our financial results may be negatively affected by any of the risk factors listed in this risk factors section and other matters described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

risks relating to our stock 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

in march 2012 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend program the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results and capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain restrictions on business combinations under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15 or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things our board of directors has approved the business combination or the transaction pursuant to which such person became a 15 holder prior to the time the person became a 15 holder

overview 

we are a fortune 500 ® science engineering and information technology company that provides services and solutions in the defense intelligence civil and health markets we bring domainspecific capability and innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging seven core capabilities cyber digital modernization integrated systems mission software systems mission support operations and logistics and sensors collection and phenomenology  our domestic customers include the us department of defense dod the us intelligence community the us department of homeland security the federal aviation administration the department of veterans affairs and many other us government civilian agencies as well as state and local government agencies our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies primarily located in australia and the united kingdom uk less than 10 of our revenues and tangible longlived assets are generated by or owned by entities located outside of the united states we operate in three reportable segments defense solutions civil and health additionally we separately present the unallocable costs associated with corporate functions as corporate 

effective the beginning of fiscal 2019 we changed the composition of our defense solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve this resulted in the identification of new operating segments within defense solutions in addition certain contracts were reassigned between the civil and defense solutions reportable segments while this activity did not have a material impact on our reportable segments prior year segment results have been recast to reflect this change

our significant initiatives include the following 

 sales trend for fiscal 2019 revenues increased 900 million  or 9 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to program wins and a net increase in program volumes partially offset by programs ended and the impact of the sale of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses for fiscal 2018 revenues were 102 billion  consistent with fiscal 2017 see results of operations below for discussion of our individual segment results 

operating expenses and income trend for fiscal 2019 operating expenses increased by 737 million  or 8  compared to fiscal 2018 operating margin for fiscal 2019 was 82 compared to 73 for fiscal 2018 operating income was 912 million  a 163 million increase compared to fiscal 2018 the increases in operating margin and operating income were primarily attributable to the receipt of the greek arbitration award favorable program mix decreases in acquisition integration and restructuring costs and lower amortization of intangible assets 

for fiscal 2018 operating expenses decreased by 161 million  or 2  compared to fiscal 2017 operating margin for fiscal 2018 was 73 compared to 55 for fiscal 2017 operating income was 749 million for fiscal 2018 a 190 million increase compared to fiscal 2017 these changes were primarily attributable to decreases in acquisition integration and restructuring costs and lower amortization of intangible assets 

from a macroeconomic perspective our industry is under general competitive pressures associated with spending from our largest customer the us government and requires a high level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive although the current administration has not indicated a desire to reduce spending in the defense and homeland security sectors the likelihood extent and duration of current spending levels in these areas remains unclear we continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary 

business environment and trends 

us government markets 

in fiscal 2019  we generated approximately 87 of our total revenues from contracts with the us government either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government revenues under contracts with the dod and us intelligence community including subcontracts under which the dod or the us intelligence community is the ultimate purchaser represented approximately 48 of our total revenues for fiscal 2019  accordingly our business performance is affected by the overall level of us government spending especially national security homeland security and intelligence spending and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the us government 

from december 21 2018 until the passage of a new continuing resolution cr on january 25 2019 there was a partial us government shutdown which reduced or delayed work on existing contracts and caused delays in other government contracting actions and payments prior to the expiration of the january cr congress passed appropriations for the seven remaining appropriations bills thereby completing funding for gfy 2019 

on july 22 2019 the white house and congress reached a twoyear budget deal to raise spending caps and suspend the debt ceiling until july 2021 allocations for national defense spending increased to 738 billion in gfy 2020 and 741 billion in gfy 2021 for nondefense programs spending increased to 632 billion in gfy 2020 and 635 billion in gfy 2021 overall the measure increased spending by 323 billion over the limits set under the bipartisan budget act of 2018 

leidos holdings inc annual report  32 

part ii 

on december 20 2019 congress passed and the president signed into law two consolidated appropriations bills thereby funding the federal government through the end of gfy 2020 

on february 10 2020 the president submitted the gfy 2021 budget proposal to congress which included discretionary spending levels for defense and nondefense programs of 741 billion and 590 billion respectively 

trends in the us government contracting process including a shift towards multipleawards contracts in which certain contractors are preapproved using indefinitedeliveryindefinitequantity idiq and us general services administration gsa contract vehicles have increased competition for us government contracts reduced backlogs by shortening periods of performance on contracts and increased pricing pressure we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process for more information on these risks and uncertainties see “risk factors” in part i of this annual report on form 10k 

international markets 

sales to customers in international markets represented 8 of total revenues for fiscal 2019  our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies primarily located in australia and the uk our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks 

recent changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials may increase our procurement costs of certain it hardware used both on our contracts and for internal use however we expect to recover certain portions of these higher tariffs through our costplus contracts while we are still evaluating the impact of higher tariffs currently we do not expect tariffs to have a significant impact to our business 

key performance measures 

the primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue operating income cash flows from operations and diluted earnings per share bookings and backlog are also useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our performance and potential future revenues in addition we consider business performance by contract type to be useful to management and investors when evaluating our operating income and margin performance

corporate operating loss represents corporate costs that are not directly related to the operating performance of the reportable segments 

the decrease in operating loss for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to the 52 million net gain recognized upon the receipt of the greek arbitration award lower acquisition integration and restructuring costs of 32 million and an asset impairment charge of 7 million in the prior year

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 226  46 and 74 in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the companys effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was favorably impacted primarily by excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions and federal research tax credits partially offset by an increase in valuation allowances arising from foreign withholding tax and an increase in taxes related to the sale of the commercial cybersecurity business 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted primarily by a decrease in valuation allowances arising from the taxable conversion of a subsidiary and the utilization of capital losses an increase in deferred tax assets related to the stock basis of a subsidiary held for sale excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions and federal research tax credits  

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted primarily by the tax cuts and jobs act’s reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 applied to our fiscal 2017 yearend deferred tax balances and excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions partially offset by the impact of certain capitalized transaction costs 

noncontrolling interest 

we have an 88 controlling interest in mission support alliance llc msa a joint venture with centerra group llc which includes 41 purchased from jacobs group llc on january 26 2018 we include the financial results for msa in our consolidated financial statements net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was 3 million and 1 million  respectively compared to net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of 2 million for fiscal 2017 

bookings and backlog 

we had net bookings of 145 billion and 137 billion during fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenue to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards that were received during the year net of any adjustments to previously awarded backlog amounts we calculate net bookings as the year’s ending backlog plus the year’s revenues less the prior year’s ending backlog and any impacts from foreign currency or acquisitions and divestitures 

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts we segregate our backlog into two categories as follows 



leidos holdings inc annual report  37 

part ii 

the estimated value of our total backlog for the periods presented was as follows 

total backlog at december 28 2018 included 165 million within our civil segment attributable to our held for sale commercial cybersecurity business see  note 7—divestitures  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

bookings and backlog fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards renewals modifications and cancellations as well as foreign currency movements contract awards may be negatively impacted by ongoing industrywide delays in procurement decisions and budget cuts by the us government as discussed in “business environment and trends” in this annual report on form 10k 

we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus government customers may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed 

contract types 

our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract for a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenues see “business—contract types” in part i of this annual report on form 10k revenues by contract type as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods presented were as follows

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

as of january 3 2020  we had 668 million in cash and cash equivalents in addition we have a secured revolving credit facility which can provide up to 750 million in secured borrowing capacity if required during fiscal 2019 and 2018  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants 

at january 3 2020 and december 28 2018  we had outstanding debt of 30 billion and 31 billion  respectively the notes outstanding as of january 3 2020  contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants we were in compliance with all covenants as of january 3 2020  during fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  we made 80 million  59 million  and 209 million of principal payments respectively on our longterm debt this activity included 69 million  46 million and 76 million of principal payments on our senior secured term loans during fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively in april 2018 we made a required debt prepayment of 10 million on our senior secured term loans the prepayment was a result of the annual excess cash flow calculation clause in our credit agreements in addition to the required quarterly payments we prepaid 130 million on our senior secured term loans during fiscal 2017 

we paid dividends of 198 million for fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  

we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

stock repurchases of leidos common stock may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties including through accelerated share repurchase asr agreements whether repurchases are made and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including price corporate capital requirements other market conditions and regulatory requirements the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time 

during fiscal 2019 and 2018 we entered into asr agreements with a financial institution whereby we paid an aggregate of 400 million and 250 million  respectively and received approximately 6 million and 4 million shares respectively of leidos outstanding shares see  note 19—earnings per share  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k the purchases were recorded to additional paidin capital in the consolidated balance sheets all shares delivered were immediately retired

summary of cash flows 

the following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 224 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes including higher advance payments from customers 59 million received for the greek arbitration award and lower payments for integration and restructuring costs these activities were partially offset by higher tax payments the timing of interest payments and 60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in the prior year 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 242 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps this was partially offset by 24 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of lockheed martins information systems  global solutions business isgs business 

net cash provided by investing activities increased 179 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was primarily due to 178 million of proceeds received for the dispositions of our commercial cybersecurity and health staff augmentation businesses 96 million of proceeds received for the sale of real estate properties and 81 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition these activities were partially offset by 94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of imx higher purchases of property equipment and software and lower proceeds from promissory notes 

net cash used in investing activities increased 43 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily due to 81 million of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the isgs business partially offset by 40 million of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note 

net cash used in financing activities increased 2 million for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was primarily due to the timing of debt payments and higher stock repurchases partially offset by 23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification in the prior year and the timing of issuances of stock 

net cash used in financing activities increased 278 million for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily due to 250 million of stock repurchases under the asr program 167 million of open market stock repurchases and 23 million of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability this was partially offset by 150 million of lower debt payments and 14 million of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction 

offbalance sheet arrangements

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes as of january 3 2020  our obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts or arrangements and provides an estimate of the fiscal years in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied 



commitments and contingencies 

we are subject to a number of reviews investigations claims lawsuits other uncertainties and future obligations related to our business for a discussion of these items see  note 13—leases   note 25—contingencies  and  note 26—commitments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates and assumptions have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

revenue recognition 

our revenues from contracts with customers are from offerings including cyber digital modernization integrated systems mission software systems mission support operations and logistics and sensors collection and phenomenology  primarily with the us government and its agencies we also serve various state and local governments foreign governments and us commercial customers 

we perform under various types of contracts which include firmfixedprice ffp timeandmaterials tm fixedpricelevelofeffort fploe costplusfixedfee costplusawardfee costplusincentivefee and fixedpriceincentivefee contracts 

to determine the proper revenue recognition we first evaluate whether we have a duly approved and enforceable contract with a customer in which the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified and collectability is probable we also evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract including the task orders issued under an idiq award in addition we assess contract modifications to determine whether changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract contract modifications for us generally relate to changes in contract specifications and requirements and do not add distinct services and therefore are accounted for as part of the original contract if contract modifications add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by an amount that reflects the standalone selling price those modifications are accounted for as separate contracts 

most of our contracts are comprised of multiple promises including the design and build of softwarebased systems integration of hardware and software solutions running and maintaining of it infrastructure and procurement services in all cases we assess if the multiple promises should be accounted for as separate performance obligations or combined into a single performance obligation we generally separate multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct both individually and in the context of the contract if multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or require significant integration or customization within a group they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation 

our contracts with the us government often contain options to renew existing contracts for an additional period of time generally a year at a time under the same terms and conditions as the original contract and generally do not provide the customer any material rights under the contract we account for renewal options as separate contracts when they include distinct goods or services at standalone selling prices 

contracts with the us government are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far and priced on estimated or actual costs of providing the goods or services the far provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the us government and its agencies each contract is competitively priced and bid separately pricing for nonus government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer in circumstances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable we estimate the standalone selling price using the expected costplus margin approach we exclude any taxes collected or imposed when determining the transaction price 

certain of our costplus and fixedprice contracts contain award fees incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion we estimate variable consideration at the most probable amount that we expect to be entitled to based on the assessment of the contractual variable fee criteria complexity of work and related risks extent of customer discretion amount of variable consideration received historically and the potential of significant reversal of revenue 

we allocate the transaction price of a contract to its performance obligations in the proportion of its respective standalone selling prices the standalone selling price of our performance obligations is generally based on an expected costplus margin approach in accordance with the far for certain product sales we use prices from other standalone sales substantially all of our contracts do not contain a significant financing component which would require an adjustment to the transaction price of the contract 

leidos holdings inc annual report  42 

part ii 

we recognize revenue on our service based contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as we perform the promised services for us government contracts continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any workinprocess similarly for nonus government contracts the customer typically controls the workinprocess as evidenced by rights to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternate use to us anticipated losses on service based contracts are recognized when known in certain product sales where the products have an alternate use we recognize revenue at a point in time when the customer takes control of the asset usually denoted by possession and legal title 

on ffp contracts requiring system integration and costplus contracts with variable consideration revenue is recognized over time generally using a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation principally using a costinput method referred to as the costtocost method under the costtocost method revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costsatcompletion eac a performance obligations eac includes all direct costs such as materials labor subcontract costs overhead and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs in addition we include in an eac of a performance obligation future losses estimated to be incurred on onerous contracts as and when known on certain other contracts principally tm fploe and costplusfixedfee revenue is recognized using the righttoinvoice practical expedient as we are contractually able to invoice the customer based on the control transferred to the customer additionally on maintenance generally ffp performance obligations revenue is recognized over time using a straightline method as the control of the services is provided to the customer evenly over the period of performance 

for certain performance obligations where we are not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or service to the customer do not have inventory risk and do not have discretion in establishing the price for the goods or service we recognize revenue on a net basis 

goodwill and intangible assets impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date goodwill and intangible assets net collectively represent 58 and 63 of our total assets as of fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively 

goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level and tested more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year during fiscal 2019 and 2018  we had six and five reporting units respectively for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment 

estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and intangibles requires the exercise of significant judgment and assumptions including judgments about expected future cash flows weightedaverage cost of capital discount rates and expected longterm growth rates a significant change to these estimates and assumptions could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units and intangible assets to decline and increase the risk of an impairment charge to earnings intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

leidos holdings inc annual report  43 

part ii 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with the accounting standard for income taxes the asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities under this method changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in income in the period such changes are enacted 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes 

the provision for federal state foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 

we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination and settlement with various taxing authorities liabilities for uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our income tax expense

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to longterm debt obligations and derivatives our policy authorizes with board of directors approval the limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific interest rate risks 

debt and derivatives 

at january 3 2020 and december 28 2018  we had 30 billion and 31 billion  respectively of longterm debt which included 19 billion and 20 billion  respectively of senior secured term loans that have variable stated interest rates that are determined based on the libor rate plus a margin as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense 

we have interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows of a portion of our variable rate senior secured term loans variable rate loans under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements we receive variable interest payments based on the onemonth libor rate and pay interest at a fixed rate during fiscal 2018 we terminated our existing interest rate swaps and entered into new interest rate swap agreements which mature in august 2025 and have a fixed interest rate of 300  to hedge the cash flows of 15 billion of our variable rate loans the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings as of january 3 2020  and december 28 2018  the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements with respect to our variable rate senior secured loans was a liability of 75 million and 32 million  respectively 

leidos holdings inc annual report  44 

part ii 

additionally we have interest rate swap agreements with respect to all of the 450 million aggregate principal outstanding on our fixed rate 445 notes maturing in december 2020 the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our fixedrate debt to floatingrate debt tied to the changes in the sixmonth libor benchmark interest rate as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements we will receive semiannual interest payments at the coupon rate of 445 and will pay variable interest based on the sixmonth libor rate as of january 3 2020  and december 28 2018  the fair value of our interest rate swaps with respect to our fixed rate debt was a 2 million asset and a 3 million liability respectively 

the counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we cannot predict future market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our interest rate swaps the net hypothetical 10 movement in the sixmonth and onemonth libor rates would not have a significant impact on our annual interest expense for additional information related to our interest rate swap agreements and debt see  note 15—derivative instruments  and  note 16—debt  respectively of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of january 3 2020  and december 28 2018  our cash and cash equivalents included investments in several large institutional money market funds and bank deposits for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018  a hypothetical 10 interest rate movement would not have a significant impact on the value of our holdings or on interest income 

foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars some of our transactions are denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our or one of our subsidiaries functional currency our foreign operations represented 8 of total revenues for fiscal 2019 and 9 of total revenues for fiscal 2018 and 2017

these customers have a number of subsidiary agencies that have separate budgets and procurement functions our contracts may be with the highest level of these agencies or with the subsidiary agencies of these customers 

employees

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities under customerfunded contracts and with companyfunded internal research and development ird funds ird efforts consist of projects involving basic research applied research development and systems and other concept formulation studies ird expenses are included in selling general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to us government contracts for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  our companyfunded ird expense was 46 million  42 million  and 44 million  respectively which as a percentage of consolidated revenues was 05  04  and 06  respectively we charge expenses for research and development activities performed under customer contracts directly to cost of revenues for those contracts 

intellectual property rights 

our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection although we do selectively seek patent protection we claim a proprietary interest in certain of our products software programs methodologies and knowhow this proprietary information is protected in confidence as trade secrets using nondisclosure agreements contracts and other definitive agreements we selectively pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties 

in connection with the performance of services and solutions the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under us governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts generally the us government may disclose or license such information to third parties including in some instances our competitors in the case of some subcontracts that we perform the prime contractor generally obtains rights to use the programs and products that we deliver under the subcontract to perform its prime contract obligations 

competition 

competition for contracts is significant and we often compete against a large number of well established corporations that may have greater name and brand recognition we also compete against smaller more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas as well as the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers as a result of the diverse requirements of the us government and our commercial customers we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations 

leidos holdings inc annual report  5 

part i 

we believe that our principal competitors currently include the following companies bae systems plc booz allen hamilton inc caci international inc general dynamics corporation l3 technologies lockheed martin corporation mantech international corporation northrop grumman corporation perspecta inc raytheon company and saic these companies span across sectors that include engineering and technical services divisions of large defense contractors diversified us and international it providers and contractors focused solely on technical services supply chain management other logistics services and major systems operations and maintenance homeland security and health solutions 

we compete on various factors including our technical expertise and qualified professional andor securitycleared personnel our ability to deliver innovative costeffective solutions in a timely manner successful program execution our reputation and standing with customers pricing and the size and geographic presence of our company 

the us government has indicated that it intends to increase competition for future procurement of products and services which has led to fewer sole source awards and more emphasis on costcompetitiveness and affordability the us government is also committed to maintaining a socioeconomically diverse base of suppliers which may lead to contracts being set aside for smaller businesses in addition procurement initiatives to improve efficiency refocus priorities and enhance best practices could result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole which would intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs 

contract procurement 

our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government and other contracts the us government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives today us government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many us government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or prequalify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through singleaward contracts the predominant contracting methods through which us government agencies procure services and products include the following 



leidos holdings inc annual report  6 

part i 

 we often partner with other companies including our competitors to submit bids for large us government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract our relationships with our partners including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program contract or customer requirements as well as the relative size qualifications capabilities customer relationships and experience of our company and our partners 

contracting with the us government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks including the us government’s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the us government issues a termination for convenience these regulations and risks are described in more detail below under business–regulation and risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

contract types 

generally the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the us government and may depend on certain factors including the type and complexity of the work to be performed degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals we generate revenues under several types of contracts including the following 



leidos holdings inc annual report  7 

part i 

 our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract and the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentivefee and awardfee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts generally have lower profitability than ffp contracts 

backlog 

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed our backlog consists of funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog backlog includes priced option periods not yet exercised we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog from us government customers as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus federal government customers included in funded backlog may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time many of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed for additional discussion and analysis of backlog see results of operations—bookings and backlog in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

the us governments fiscal year ends on september 30 of each year while not certain it is not uncommon for us government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter in addition our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter we tend to generate less revenue from our labor services during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season for selected quarterly financial data see selected quarterly financial data in part ii of this annual report on form 10k

regulation 

we are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate we provide services and products to numerous us government agencies and entities including to the dod the us intelligence community and the dhs when working with these and other us government agencies and entities we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of contracts us government contracts generally are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far which sets forth policies procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the us government agencyspecific regulations that implement or supplement the far such as the department of defense federal acquisition regulation supplement and other applicable laws and regulations these regulations impose a broad range of requirements many of which are unique to government contracting including various procurement import and export security contract pricing and cost contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements among other things these laws and regulations 

 the us government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time in order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance trainings relevant to their position

 item 1a   risk factors 

in your evaluation of our company and business you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed and the price of our stock could decline our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as our ability to collect receivables overall us and global economic and industry conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest and exchange rates terrorism international conflicts major health concerns climate change or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially harm our business financial condition or operating results and result in a decline in the price of our stock 

risks relating to our business 

we depend on government agencies as our primary customer and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected 

we generated 85  84  and 81  of our total revenues during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively from contracts with the us government including all branches of the us military either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government we generated more than 10  of our total revenues during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  from the us army we expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under us government contracts our reputation and relationship with the us government and in particular with the agencies of the dod and the us intelligence community are key factors in maintaining and growing our revenues negative press reports or publicity which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct conflicts of interest poor contract performance deficiencies in services reports products or other deliverables information security breaches or other aspects of our business regardless of accuracy could harm our reputation particularly with these agencies if our reputation is negatively affected or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected 

a decline in the us government budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

revenues under contracts with the dod either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors represented approximately 47  of our total revenues for fiscal 2018  and 2017  and   56  of our total revenues for fiscal 2016  levels of us government and dod spending are difficult to predict and subject to significant risk our operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the us government or the dod as well as delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts current us government spending levels for defenserelated or other programs may not be sustained and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of uncertainty surrounding the federal budget increasing political pressure and legislation shifts in spending priorities from defenserelated or other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors 

the us government also conducts periodic reviews of us defense strategies and priorities which may shift dod or other budgetary priorities reduce overall us government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defenserelated or other programs including programs from which we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues in addition changes to the federal or dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so a significant decline in overall us government spending including in the areas of national security intelligence and homeland security a significant shift in its spending priorities the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defenserelated programs or significant delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

leidos holdings inc annual report  11 

part i 

because we depend on us government contracts a delay in the completion of the us governments budget and appropriation process could delay procurement of the products services and solutions we provide and have an adverse effect on our future revenues 

the funding of us government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriations process in years when the us government does not complete its appropriations before the beginning of the new fiscal year on october 1 government operations are typically funded pursuant to a continuing resolution which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous appropriations cycle but does not authorize new spending initiatives when the us government operates under a continuing resolution delays can occur in the procurement of the products services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being canceled we have from time to time experienced a decline in revenues in our fourth quarter as a result of this annual appropriations cycle and we could experience similar declines in revenues from future delays in the appropriations process when the us government fails to complete its appropriations process or to provide for a continuing resolution a full or partial federal government shutdown may result a federal government shutdown could in turn result in our incurrence of substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts the delay or cancellation of key programs or the delay of contract payments which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results in addition when supplemental appropriations are required to operate the us government or fund specific programs and passage of legislation needed to approve any supplemental appropriations bill is delayed the overall funding environment for our business could be adversely affected for additional discussion and analysis of the potential of an ongoing us government shutdown see business environment and trends in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties including termination of our us government contracts disqualification from bidding on future us government contracts and suspension or debarment from us government contracting 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business some significant statutes and regulations that affect us include 

 the far and many of our us government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers organizational conflicts of interest arise when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the us government impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage a conflict of interest issue that precludes our competition for or performance on a significant program or contract could harm our prospects

the us government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies and recovery of costs among other items us government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors legislation regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of us government agencies such as increased usage of fixedprice contracts multipleaward contracts and small business setaside contracts could have adverse effects on government contractors including us any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when those contracts are recompeted any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues profitability and prospects 

our business is subject to reviews audits and cost adjustments by the us government which if resolved unfavorably to us could adversely affect our profitability cash position or growth prospects 

us government agencies including the dcaa dcma and others routinely audit and review a contractors performance on government contracts indirect rates and pricing practices and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations and standards they also review the adequacy of the contractor’s compliance with government standards for its business systems including a contractors accounting system earned value management system estimating system materials management and accounting system property management system and purchasing system 

both contractors and the us government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny as a result the current audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome during the course of its current audits the dcaa is closely examining and questioning several of our long established and disclosed practices that it had previously audited and accepted increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate conclusion that will be reached 

a finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our us government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and our remediations are accepted by dcma government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds such adjustments can be applied retroactively which could result in significant customer refunds our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an approved determination of our various business systems from the responsible us government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process a determination of noncompliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations and standards could also result in the us government imposing penalties and sanctions against us including withholding of payments suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts perform contracts or compete for contracts with the us government 

as of december 28 2018  indirect cost audits by the dcaa remain open for fiscal 2013  and subsequent fiscal years although we have recorded contract revenues based upon our estimate of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review we cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and if future adjustments exceed our estimates our profitability may be adversely affected

our business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and growth prospects 

we are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to federal state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside the united states if a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions including the termination of contracts forfeiture of profits the triggering of price reduction clauses suspension of payments fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies we may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry if we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation our revenues profitability cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected more generally increases in scrutiny and investigations from government organizations legislative bodies or agencies into business practices and into major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation revenues profitability and growth prospects 

misconduct of employees subcontractors agents and business partners could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation 

misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws including the antikickback act other examples could include the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal state or local government procurement regulations regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts laws and regulations relating to environmental health or safety matters bribery of foreign government officials importexport control lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims remediation costs regulatory sanctions against us loss of current and future contracts and serious harm to our reputation although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and as a result we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees subcontractors agents or business partners could damage our reputation and subject us to fines and penalties restitution or other damages loss of security clearance loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal state or local government agencies any of which would adversely affect our business reputation and our future results 

due to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability 

we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process the us government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a continuing competitive bidding process including idiq gsa schedule and other multiaward contracts which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure the competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders and to the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win following contract award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding any resulting loss or delay of startup and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues andor profitability in addition multiaward contracts require that we make sustained postaward efforts to obtain task orders under the contract as a result we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multiaward contracts our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues andor profitability

the us government may terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and if we do not replace them this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability 

many of the us government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years these programs are normally funded on an annual basis under our contracts the us government generally has the right to not exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience any decisions by the us government to not exercise contract options or to terminate cancel modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues revenue growth and profitability 

we have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts some of our contracts involve the development of complex systems and products to achieve challenging customer goals in a competitive procurement environment as a result we sometimes experience technological or other performance difficulties which have in the past and may in the future result in delays cost overruns and failures in our performance of these contracts if a government customer terminates a contract for default we may be exposed to liability including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and products from another source depending on the nature and value of the contract a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation 

we face aggressive competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects 

our business is highly competitive and we compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition financial resources and a larger technical staff we also compete with smaller more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas additionally we compete with the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology and the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address these changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products to remain competitive we must consistently provide superior service technology and performance on a costeffective basis to our customers our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide including technical qualifications past contract experience geographic presence price and the availability of qualified professional personnel in addition our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers’ needs accordingly we anticipate that larger or new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge which may adversely affect our ability to compete 

a failure to attract train and retain skilled employees including our management team would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations 

our business involves the development of tailored services and solutions for our customers a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees our continued success depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled engineering technical and professional personnel competition for skilled personnel is intense and competitors aggressively recruit key employees in addition many us government programs require contractors to have security clearances depending on the level of required clearance security clearances can be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and personnel with security clearances are in great demand particularly in highly specialized areas it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner which may affect our growth although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit train and retain qualified employees we may not be able to attract effectively train and retain these employees any failure to do so could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations efficiently and timely meet our customers’ needs and win new business which could adversely affect our future results 

leidos holdings inc annual report  15

in addition to attracting and retaining qualified engineering technical and professional personnel we believe that our success will also depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and its ability to retain existing business and generate new business our senior management team is important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of retaining and obtaining customer contracts in our industry particularly with agencies performing classified operations an inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives could cause us to lose customers or new business opportunities 

we may not realize as revenues the full amounts reflected in our backlog which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects 

as of december 28 2018  our total backlog was 208 billion  including 64 billion  in funded backlog due to the us governments ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our nonus government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances we may realize less than expected or may never realize revenues from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog our unfunded backlog in particular contains management’s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues if we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog our future revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs time and resources 

we generate revenues under various types of contracts which include costreimbursement fpif tm fploe and ffp contracts our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentivefee and awardfee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts are generally less profitable than ffp contracts our operating results in any period may also be affected positively or negatively by customers variable purchasing patterns of our more profitable proprietary products 

our profitability is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers to varying degrees each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract while ffp contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns revenues from ffp contracts represented approximately 31  of our total revenues for fiscal 2018  when making proposals on these types of contracts we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects as well as assumptions regarding technical issues in each case our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during performance could result and in some instances has resulted in reduced profits or in losses more generally any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in the performance of our contracts including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control such as performance failures of our subcontractors natural disasters or other force majeure events could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable 

we use estimates in recognizing revenues and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues our profitability may be adversely affected 

we recognize revenue on our service based contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as we perform the promised services which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known changes in the underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results

legal disputes could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability and could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims described in legal proceedings in part i of this annual report on form 10k as may be updated in our future filings with the sec including our quarterly reports on form 10q we are also subject to and may become a party to a variety of other litigation or claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation could be costly to defend and even if we are successful or if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future litigation and other claims including those described in legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future 

our business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous federal state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection employment and labor relations immigration taxation anticorruption importexport controls trade restrictions internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation and anticompetition compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources we also conduct business in certain identified growth areas such as health information technology energy and environmental services which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations 

information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results or cause harm to our reputation or competitive position 

as a government contractor and a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies we and our suppliers and subcontractors process andor store sensitive information including personally identifiable information protected health information personnel information classified information contractor unclassified information and financial information concerning our business employees and our customers therefore we are continuously exposed to unauthorized attempts to compromise such sensitive information through cyberattacks insider threats and other information security threats including physical breakins and malicious insiders any electronic or physical breakin or other security breach or compromise may jeopardize security of information stored or transmitted through our information technology systems and networks this could lead to disruptions in missioncritical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data or systems 

although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to protect against detect and mitigate these threats we face advanced and persistent attacks on our information systems attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information are constantly evolving increasingly sophisticated and increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against these attempts include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others and may be perpetrated by wellfunded organized crime or statesponsored efforts 

we seek to detect and investigate all information security incidents and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence we continue to invest in and improve our threat protection detection and mitigation policies procedures and controls in addition we work with other companies in the industry and government participants on increased awareness and enhanced protections against information security and malicious insider threats however because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats which can be difficult to detect there can be no assurance that our policies procedures and controls have detected or will detect or prevent any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident we may be currently unaware of certain vulnerabilities or lack the capability to detect them which may allow them to persist in our it environment over long periods of time

we may experience similar security threats to the information technology systems that we develop install or maintain under customer contracts although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners including our suppliers and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber and other security threats we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber or other security threats may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means occurrence of any of these security threats could disrupt our systems or those of our customers impair our ability to provide services to our customers result in product development delays compromise confidential or technical business information and as a result   expose us to claims contract terminations and damages and could adversely affect our reputation ability to win work on sensitive us government contracts business operations and financial results 

internal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

any system or service disruptions including those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services whether through our shared services organization or outsourced services if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business including among other things an adverse effect on our ability to perform on contracts bill our customers for work performed on our contracts collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner we are also subject to systems failures including network software or hardware failures whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats malicious insiders natural disasters power shortages terrorist attacks or other events which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business cause us to incur remediation costs subject us to claims and damage our reputation in addition the failure or disruption of our communications could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and as a result our future results could be adversely affected 

customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

many of the systems and networks that we develop install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions while we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions if a system or network that we develop install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats or other events we may experience loss of revenue remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and as a result our future results could be adversely affected 

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

we design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements 

in addition our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability such as problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract costs and fee payments we previously received

we have contracts with the us government that are classified which may limit investor insight into portions of our business 

we derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the us government that are subject to security restrictions classified programs which preclude the dissemination of information that is classified for national security purposes we are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business 

we have made and continue to make acquisitions investments joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 

we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures these transactions require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities even if successful these transactions could reduce earnings for a number of reasons including the amortization of intangible assets impairment charges acquired operations that are not yet profitable or the payment of additional consideration under earnout arrangements if an acquisition performs better than expected acquisitions investments and joint ventures pose many other risks that could adversely affect our reputation operations or financial results including 

 if our acquisitions investments or joint ventures fail perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we periodically divest businesses including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan these divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources may disrupt our business distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business including through indemnification guarantee or other financial arrangements for a period of time following the transaction which would adversely affect our financial results

goodwill and other intangible assets represent approximately 63  of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations 

intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition loss of key personnel or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government our primary customer as well as challenges in the commercial healthcare industry compounded by lower levels of us government reimbursements including reductions in medicare reimbursements which in turn impact hospital it spending adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions such as the manner in which budget cuts are implemented including sequestration and issues related to the nation’s debt ceiling could adversely impact our future revenues and profitability these circumstances could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles also adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our profitability and financial results 

we depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors if we are not able to maintain these relationships or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer our revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors who are also often our competitors in other contexts in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services and products provided by us and other companies will help us to win and perform the contract our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us or if the us government terminates or reduces these other contractors’ programs does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract companies that do not have access to us government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies’ prospect of securing a future position as a prime us government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts 

we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor customer concerns about the subcontractor our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract our hiring of a subcontractor’s personnel or the subcontractor’s failure to comply with applicable law uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our subcontractors which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us if any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default a termination for default could eliminate a revenue source expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders especially if the customer is an agency of the us government

our services and operations sometimes involve using handling or disposing of hazardous substances which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities 

some of our services and operations involve the assessment or remediation of environmental hazards as well as the use handling or disposal of hazardous substances these activities and our operations generally subject us to extensive foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations which among other things require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances furthermore failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanctions including fines penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government our current and previous ownership and operation of real property also subjects us to environmental protection laws some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property liable for hazardous substance releases even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our inspection or detection systems fail to detect bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats 

we design develop manufacture sell service and maintain various inspection systems that are designed to assist in the detection of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats in some instances we also train operators of such systems many of these systems utilize software algorithms that are probabilistic in nature and subject to significant technical limitations many of these systems are also dependent on the performance of their operators there are many factors some of which are beyond our control which could result in the failure of our products to help detect the presence of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats some of these factors could include operator error inherent limitations in our systems and misuse or malfunction of our systems the failure of our systems to help detect the presence of any of these dangerous materials could lead to injury death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability professional liability or other claims against us further if our systems fail to or are perceived to have failed to help detect a threat the negative publicity from such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims or losses 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits however not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance and for those risks we insure the limits of coverage we purchase or that are reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred if any of our thirdparty insurers fail cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant product and other liability claims or losses moreover there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost if at all if liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage our business financial position operating results and prospects may be harmed regardless of the adequacy of our liability insurance coverages any significant claim may have an adverse effect on our industry and market reputation leading to a substantial decrease in demand for our products and services and reduced revenues 

we face risks associated with our international business 

our international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our us business failure to comply with us government and foreign laws and regulations applicable to international business such as the foreign corrupt practices act or us export control regulations could have an adverse impact on our business with the us government and could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties additionally these risks relating to international operations may expose us to potentially significant contract losses

in some countries there is an increased chance for economic legal or political changes that may adversely affect the performance of our services sale of our products or repatriation of our profits international transactions can also involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability imposition of tariffs or additional taxes restrictive trade policies any delay or failure to collect amounts due to us and differing legal systems we provide services and products in support of us government customers in countries with governments that may be or may become unstable which increases the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life damage or destruction of property or inability to meet our contractual obligations although our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues we are seeking to grow our international business in which case these regulatory geopolitical and other factors may have a greater impact on our business in the future and could adversely affect our business 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success our failure to adequately protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position 

we rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable however trade secrets are difficult to protect although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights trademarks or other proprietary information our competitive position could be adversely affected in addition in connection with the performance of services the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts which means that the us government may disclose or license our information to third parties including in some instances our competitors 

in the course of conducting our business we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims against us or our customers our contracts generally indemnify our customers for thirdparty claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide the expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results 

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod 

our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control for these reasons comparing our operating results on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance our financial results may be negatively affected by any of the risk factors listed in this risk factors section and other matters described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

accounting for many of our programs requires judgment relative to assessing risks including risks associated with estimating directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual matters judgments associated with estimating contract revenues and costs and assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for example we must make assumptions regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials consider whether the intent of entering into multiple contracts was effectively to enter into a single project in order to determine whether such contracts should be combined or segmented consider incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating revenue and profit rates and record them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance and use estimates of award fees in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition

in march 2012 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend program the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results and capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor 

some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares these restrictions which may also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors not endorsed by our current directors and management include the following 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain restrictions on business combinations under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15  or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things our board of directors has approved the business combination or the transaction pursuant to which such person became a 15  holder prior to the time the person became a 15  holder

our significant initiatives include the following 



leidos holdings inc annual report  31 

part ii 

 sales trend for fiscal 2018 revenues were 102 billion  consistent with fiscal 2017 for fiscal 2017 revenues increased by 31 billion  or 44  compared to fiscal 2016 primarily attributable to the information systems  global solutions business the isgs business of lockheed martin corporation acquired during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and growth in airborne programs the increase was partially offset by   fiscal 2016 revenues from the divestiture of the heavy construction business net volume decreases and   lower revenues from our international business  see results of operations below for discussion of our individual segment results 

operating expenses and income trend for fiscal 2018 operating expenses decreased by 161 million  or 2  compared to fiscal 2017 operating margin for fiscal 2018 was 73  compared to 55  for fiscal 2017 operating income was 749 million  for fiscal 2018 a 190 million  increase compared to fiscal 2017 these changes were primarily attributable to decreases in acquisition integration and restructuring costs and lower amortization of intangible assets 

for fiscal 2017 operating expenses increased by 30 billion  or 45  compared to fiscal 2016 primarily attributable to the acquired isgs business operating margin for fiscal 2017 was 55  compared to 59  for fiscal 2016 the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to   a contract writeup in fiscal 2016 along with an increase in acquisition integration and restructuring costs  for fiscal 2017 our operating income was 559 million  a 142 million  increase compared to fiscal 2016 the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the operating results of the acquired isgs business 

from a macroeconomic perspective our industry is under general competitive pressures associated with spending from our largest customer the us government and has required and will require a higher level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive although the current administration has indicated a desire to increase spending primarily in the defense and homeland security sectors the likelihood extent and duration of higher spending in these areas remains unclear we continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary

leidos holdings inc annual report  32

in connection with the transactions leidos incurred new indebtedness and assumed splitcos indebtedness in the form of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of 690 million  and 18 billion  respectively and entered into a new 750 million  senior secured revolving credit facility which replaced its existing revolving credit facility see  note 15—debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the new debt incurred and the new senior revolving credit facility 

in conjunction with the transactions our board of directors declared a special dividend of 1364  per share of leidos common stock consequently on august 22 2016 we paid 993 million  to stockholders of record as of august 15 2016 and accrued 29 million  of dividend equivalents with respect to outstanding unvested equity awards see  note 19—stockbased compensation  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the modifications made to our outstanding stock awards as a result of the special dividend 

we incurred 29 million  77 million  and 46 million  of integration costs during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

after the acquisition of the isgs business we began an initiative to review our cost structure which included optimization of our real estate portfolio by vacating facilities that were not necessary for future requirements and reducing headcount for fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  we recognized 8 million  37 million  and 12 million  respectively of restructuring expenses related to this program 

business environment and trends 

us government markets 

in fiscal 2018  we generated approximately 85  of our total revenues from contracts with the us government either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government revenues under contracts with the dod including subcontracts under which the dod is the ultimate purchaser represented approximately 47  of our total revenues for fiscal 2018  accordingly our business performance is affected by the overall level of us government spending especially national security homeland security and intelligence spending and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the us government 

in march 2018 congress passed and the president signed into law the omnibus appropriations bill thereby funding the federal government through the end of the 2018 government fiscal year gfy the appropriations legislation passed earlier in the year suspended previously enacted budget caps and included a twoyear budget agreement that provided 300 billion  in sequestration relief for defense and nondefense spending defense programs saw additional funding of 80 billion  and 85 billion  in gfy 2018 and gfy 2019 respectively and nondefense funding increased by 63 billion  and 68 billion  in gfy 2018 and gfy 2019 respectively over the caps established in the budget control act of 2011 the legislation also suspended the debt ceiling until march 2019 

in september 2018 congress passed and the president signed a second consolidated appropriations bill funding the departments of defense labor and health and human services for the full gfy 2019 earlier in the year funding for the departments of veterans affairs and energy as well as funding for congress were also enacted all were funded at increased levels from the previous year 

the remaining seven appropriations bills were operating under a continuing resolution cr until it expired on december 21 2018 from the expiration of that cr until the passage of a new cr on january 25 2019 there was a partial us government shutdown which reduced or delayed work on existing contracts and caused delays in other government contracting actions and payments prior to the expiration of the january cr congress passed appropriations for the seven remaining appropriations bills thereby completing funding for gfy 2019 

trends in the us government contracting process including a shift towards multipleawards contracts in which certain contractors are preapproved using indefinitedeliveryindefinitequantity idiq and us general services administration gsa contract vehicles and awarding contracts on a low price technically acceptable basis have increased competition for us government contracts reduced backlogs by shortening periods of performance on contracts and increased pricing pressure we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process for more information on these risks and uncertainties see “risk factors” in part i of this annual report on form 10k

international markets 

sales to customers in international markets represented 9  of total revenues for fiscal 2018  our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies primarily located in the uk and australia our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks 

recent changes in international trade policies including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials may increase our procurement costs of certain it hardware used both on our contracts and for internal use however we expect to recover certain portions of these higher tariffs through our costplus contracts while we are still evaluating the impact of higher tariffs currently we do not expect tariffs to have a significant impact to our business 

key performance measures 

the primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue operating income cash flows from operations and diluted earnings per share bookings and backlog are also useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our performance and potential future revenues in addition we consider business performance by contract type to be useful to management and investors when evaluating our operating income and margin performance

the increase in revenues for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the acquired isgs business of 1146 million and growth in airborne programs partially offset by completion of certain contracts net volume decreases and a contract writeup in fiscal 2016 

the increase in operating income for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to lower amortization

corporate operating loss represents corporate costs that are not directly related to the operating performance of the reportable segments 

the decrease in operating loss for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to lower acquisition integration and restructuring costs of 102 million partially offset by increased legal fees and an asset impairment charge of 7 million  

the increase in operating loss for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to increases of 31 million  of integration costs incurred related to the acquisition of the isgs business and 23 million of restructuring expenses due to severance costs and lease termination expenses this was partially offset by a decrease of 19 million  of acquisition costs incurred related to the isgs business the acquisition costs incurred during fiscal 2017 were primarily attributable to a 24 million  working capital adjustment recorded as a result of the settlement agreement reached 

equity earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries 

as a result of the transactions we received certain noncontrolling ownership interests in equity method investments for fiscal 2018 and 2017 we recorded earnings of 28 million  and 27 million  respectively from our equity method investments partially offset by amortization of 10 million  and 14 million  respectively for fiscal 2016 we recorded earnings of 10 million  from our equity method investments 

nonoperating expense 

nonoperating expense decreased 27 million  for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to a 33 million  promissory note impairment that occurred during fiscal 2017 partially offset by unfavorable fair value changes on investments held in our benefit plans 

leidos holdings inc annual report  37 

part ii 

nonoperating expense increased 67 million  for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to interest expense associated with our term loans secured in connection with the transactions and a 33 million  promissory note impairment that occurred during fiscal 2017 the increase in nonoperating expense was partially offset by favorable yearoveryear foreign currency exchange movements mostly due to the movement of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound 

provision for income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the tax act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code including but not limited to 1 reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35  to 21  2 requiring companies to pay a onetime transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 3 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries and 4 limiting the deductibility of certain executive compensation see “ note 20—income taxes ” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k for further information on the impacts of this legislation 

our effective tax rate was 46  74  and 226  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted primarily by a decrease in valuation allowances arising from the taxable conversion of a subsidiary and the utilization of capital losses an increase in deferred tax assets related to the stock basis of a subsidiary held for sale excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions and federal research tax credits  

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted primarily by the tax act’s reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 applied to our fiscal 2017 yearend deferred tax balances and excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions partially offset by the impact of certain capitalized transaction costs 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted primarily by the tax deductibility of the special cash dividend related to the transactions described in “ note 6—acquisitions ” on shares held by the leidos retirement plan excess tax benefits related to employee stockbased payment transactions and federal research tax credits partially offset by the impact of certain capitalized transaction costs related to the transactions 

noncontrolling interest 

as a result of the transactions we received an interest in mission support alliance llc msa a joint venture with centerra group llc on january 26 2018 we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with jacobs engineering group inc jacobs group whereby we purchased 100  of jacobs groups 41  outstanding membership interest in msa as a result we increased our controlling ownership in msa from 47  to 88  we include the financial results for msa in our consolidated financial statements net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2016 was 1 million  and 2 million  respectively compared to net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest of 2 million  for fiscal 2017 

bookings and backlog 

we had net bookings of 137 billion  and 97 billion  during fiscal 2018  and 2017  respectively net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenue to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards that were received during the year net of any adjustments to previously awarded backlog amounts we calculate net bookings as the year’s ending backlog plus the year’s revenues less the prior year’s ending backlog and any impacts from foreign currency 

leidos holdings inc annual report  38 

part ii 

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts which consists of remaining performance obligations see  note 4—revenues  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k and unexercised option periods we segregate our backlog into two categories as follows 

 the estimated value of our total backlog for the periods presented was as follows 

total backlog at december 28 2018  included an adverse impact of 171 million  when compared to total backlog at december 29 2017 due to exchange rate movements in the british pound and australian dollar when compared to the us dollar total backlog at december 28 2018  included 165 million  within our civil segment attributable to our held for sale commercial cybersecurity business see  note 7—divestitures  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k for more information on the expected sale 

bookings and backlog fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards renewals modifications and cancellations as well as foreign currency movements contract awards may be negatively impacted by ongoing industrywide delays in procurement decisions and budget cuts by the us government as discussed in “business environment and trends” in this annual report on form 10k 

leidos holdings inc annual report  39 

part ii 

we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus government customers may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed 

contract types 

our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract for a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenues see “business—contract types” in part i of this annual report on form 10k revenues by contract type as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods presented were as follows 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

as of december 28 2018  we had 327 million  in cash and cash equivalents in addition we have a secured revolving credit facility which can provide up to 750 million  in secured borrowing capacity if required during fiscal 2018  and 2017  there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants 

in august 2016 our board of directors declared a special dividend of 1364  per share of leidos common stock consequently on august 22 2016 we paid 993 million  to stockholders of record as of august 15 2016 and accrued 29 million  of dividend equivalents with respect to the outstanding unvested equity awards in addition we paid dividends of 198 million   for fiscal 2018   and   2017  and 142 million  for fiscal 2016

in connection with the transactions leidos incurred 25 billion  of new indebtedness in the form of term loans see  note 6—acquisitions  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k during fiscal 2018  and 2017  we made 59 million  and 209 million  of principal payments respectively on our longterm debt which was primarily related to our senior secured term loans this activity included 46 million  and 76 million  of required quarterly payments on our term loans during fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  respectively in april 2018 we made a required debt prepayment of 10 million  on our senior secured term loans the prepayment was a result of the annual excess cash flow calculation clause in our credit agreements in addition to the required quarterly payments we prepaid 130 million  and 275 million  on our term loans during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 respectively see  note 15—debt  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows on our variable rate senior secured term loans see  note 14—derivative instruments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k as of december 28 2018 we had cash flow interest rate swaps on 15 billion  of the companys variable rate senior secured term loans the objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of our variable rate secured notes 

we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material 

leidos holdings inc annual report  40 

part ii 

stock repurchases of leidos common stock may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties including through accelerated share repurchase asr agreements whether repurchases are made and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including price corporate capital requirements other market conditions and regulatory requirements the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time 

during fiscal 2018 we entered into an asr agreement with a financial institution whereby we paid an aggregate of 250 million  and received approximately 4 million  shares of leidos outstanding shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 see  note 18—earnings per share  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k all shares delivered were immediately retired additionally during fiscal 2018 we made open market repurchases of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 167 million  during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 there were no open market repurchases of our common stock 

for the next 12 months we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs including servicing our debt through cash generated from operations available cash balances and if needed borrowings from our revolving credit facility 

summary of cash flows 

the following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 242 million  for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily due to lower payments for taxes integration and restructuring costs and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps this was partially offset by 24 million  of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the isgs business 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 77 million  for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the increase was primarily due to the favorable timing of working capital changes partially offset by higher integration and restructuring costs and higher payments for interest and taxes 

net cash used in investing activities increased 43 million  for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily due to 81 million  of cash paid related to the 2016 acquisition of the isgs business partially offset by 40 million  of proceeds from the settlement of a promissory note 

net cash used in investing activities increased 97 million  for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the increase was primarily due to cash acquired as part of the acquisition of the isgs business in fiscal 2016 proceeds received from the divestiture of the heavy construction business in fiscal 2016 and higher purchases of property plant and equipment 

net cash used in financing activities increased 278 million  for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily due to 250 million  of stock repurchases under the asr program 167 million  of open market stock repurchases and 23 million  of cash paid related to a tax indemnification liability this was partially offset by 150 million of lower debt payments and 14 million  of proceeds received from a real estate financing transaction

part ii 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 322 million  for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease was primarily due to a special dividend cash payment in connection with the transactions of 993 million  in fiscal 2016 and decreased payments of longterm debt of 68 million  partially offset by net proceeds from debt issuance activity of 660 million  in fiscal 2016 as well as higher dividend payments of 56 million  and less proceeds from issuances of stock of 12 million  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have outstanding performance guarantees and crossindemnity agreements in connection with certain aspects of our business we also have letters of credit outstanding principally related to performance guarantees on contracts and surety bonds outstanding principally related to performance and subcontractor payment bonds as described in  note 26—commitments  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k these arrangements have not had and management does not believe it is likely that they will in the future have a material effect on our liquidity capital resources operations or financial condition

critical accounting policies 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates and assumptions have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 revenue recognition 

our revenues from contracts with customers are from offerings including enterprise modernization cyber operations operations and logistics mission software systems integrated systems sensors and phenomenology and mission support  primarily with the us government and its agencies we also serve various state and local governments foreign governments and us commercial customers 

we perform under various types of contracts which include firmfixedprice ffp timeandmaterials tm fixedpricelevelofeffort fploe costplusfixedfee costplusawardfee costplusincentivefee and fixedpriceincentivefee contracts 

to determine the proper revenue recognition we first evaluate whether we have a duly approved and enforceable contract with a customer in which the rights of the parties and payment terms are identified and collectability is probable we also evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract including the task orders issued under an idiq award in addition we assess contract modifications to determine whether the changes to existing contracts should be accounted for as part of the original contract or as a separate contract contract modifications for us generally relate to changes in contract specifications and requirements and do not add distinct services and therefore are accounted for as part of the original contract if contract modifications add distinct goods or services and increase the contract value by an amount that reflects the standalone selling price those modifications are accounted for as separate contracts 

most of our contracts are comprised of multiple promises including the design and build of softwarebased systems integration of hardware and software solutions running and maintaining of it infrastructure and procurement services in all cases we assess if the multiple promises should be accounted for as separate performance obligations or combined into a single performance obligation we generally separate multiple promises in a contract as separate performance obligations if those promises are distinct both individually and in the context of the contract if multiple promises in a contract are highly interrelated or require significant integration or customization within a group they are combined and accounted for as a single performance obligation 

our contracts with the us government often contain options to renew existing contracts for an additional period of time generally a year at a time under the same terms and conditions as the original contract and generally do not provide the customer any material rights under the contract we account for renewal options as separate contracts when they include distinct goods or services at standalone selling prices 

leidos holdings inc annual report  43 

part ii 

contracts with the us government are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far and priced on estimated or actual costs of providing the goods or services the far provides guidance on types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided to the us government and its agencies each contract is competitively priced and bid separately pricing for nonus government agencies and commercial customers is based on specific negotiations with each customer in circumstances where the standalone selling price is not directly observable we estimate the standalone selling price using the expected cost plus margin approach we exclude any taxes collected or imposed when determining the transaction price 

certain of our costplus and fixedprice contracts contain award fees incentive fees or other provisions that may either increase or decrease the transaction price these variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion we estimate variable consideration at the most probable amount that we expect to be entitled to based on the assessment of the contractual variable fee criteria complexity of work and related risks extent of customer discretion amount of variable consideration received historically and the potential of significant reversal of revenue 

we allocate the transaction price of a contract to our performance obligations in the proportion of its respective standalone selling prices the standalone selling price of our performance obligations is generally based on an expected costplus margin approach in accordance with the far for certain product sales we use prices from other standalone sales substantially all of our contracts do not contain a significant financing component which would require an adjustment to the transaction price of the contract 

we recognize revenue on our service based contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as we perform the promised services for us government contracts continuous transfer of control to the customer is evidenced by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any workinprocess similarly for nonus government contracts the customer typically controls the workinprocess as evidenced by rights to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable profit to deliver products or services that do not have an alternate use to us anticipated losses on service based contracts are recognized when known in certain product sales where the products have an alternate use we recognize revenue at a point in time when the customer takes control of the asset usually denoted by possession and legal title 

on ffp contracts revenue recognized over time generally uses a method that measures the extent of progress towards completion of a performance obligation principally using a costinput method referred to as the costtocost method under the costtocost method revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costsatcompletion eac a performance obligations eac includes all direct costs such as materials labor subcontract costs overhead and a ratable portion of general and administrative costs in addition we include in an eac of a performance obligation future losses estimated to be incurred on onerous contracts as and when known on certain other contracts principally tm fploe and costplus revenue is recognized using the righttoinvoice practical expedient as we are contractually able to invoice the customer based on the control transferred to the customer additionally on maintenance generally ffp performance obligations revenue is recognized over time using a straightline method as the control of the services is provided to the customer evenly over the period of performance 

for certain performance obligations we are not primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the goods or service to the customer do not have inventory risk and do not have discretion in establishing the price for the goods or service in such cases we recognize revenue on a net basis 

changes in estimates on contracts 

changes in estimates related to contracts accounted for using the costtocost method of accounting are recognized in the period in which such changes are made for the inceptiontodate effect of the changes with the exception of contracts acquired through the acquisition of the isgs business where the adjustment is made for the period commencing from the date of acquisition 

leidos holdings inc annual report  44 

part ii 

changes in estimates on contracts for the periods presented were as follows 



the increase in the changes in estimates on contracts from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 is primarily due to completion of contracts or events which mitigated risk and due to the finalization of award and incentive fees 

the impact on diluted eps attributable to leidos common stockholders is calculated using our statutory tax rate 

during fiscal 2018  revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied in previous periods was 102 million  the changes primarily relate to revisions of variable consideration including award fees and revisions to estimates at completion resulting from changes in contract scope mitigation of contract risks or due to trueups of contract estimates at the end of contract performance  

goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level and tested more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable our policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year during fiscal 2018  we had five reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment 

goodwill is evaluated for impairment either under a qualitative assessment option or a quantitative approach depending on the facts and circumstances of a reporting unit consideration of the excess of a reporting units fair value over its carrying amount in previous assessments and changes in business environment 

when performing a qualitative assessment we consider factors including but not limited to current macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors financial performance and other events relevant to the entity or reporting unit under evaluation to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed 

when performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test the reporting unit carrying value is compared to its fair value goodwill is deemed impaired if and the impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value for fiscal 2018 a qualitative analysis was performed for four of our reporting units and a quantitative step one analysis was performed for one reporting unit a quantitative analysis was performed for all reporting units for fiscal 2017  

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using both market and income approaches when a quantitative analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the reporting units the outputs from both methods are equally weighted 

the market approach is a technique where the fair value is calculated based on the multiples of comparable publiclytraded companies that provide a reasonable basis of comparison with each of our reporting units valuation ratios are selected that relate market prices to selected financial metrics from comparable companies these ratios are applied after consideration of adjustments and weightings related to financial position growth volatility working capital movement and other factors due to the fact that stock prices of comparable companies represent minority interests we also consider an acquisition control premium to reflect the impact of additional value associated with a controlling interest 

leidos holdings inc annual report  45 

part ii 

the income approach is a technique where the fair value is calculated based on present value future cash flows using riskadjusted discount rates which represent the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc for each reporting unit determination of wacc includes assessing the cost of equity and debt as of the valuation date in addition a terminal value is developed for forecasted future cash flows beyond the projection period discounted back to the present value the forecasts used in our estimation of fair value are developed by management based on business and market considerations 

the goodwill impairment test process and valuation model is based upon certain key assumptions that require the exercise of significant judgment and assumptions including the use of appropriate financial projections economic expectations wacc and expected longterm growth rates as well as using available market data significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions and actual future results may differ from the estimates in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also requires judgment 

based on a qualitative analysis performed during our annual impairment evaluation for fiscal 2018 for certain of our reporting units it was determined that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were in excess of the individual reporting unit carrying values and as a result a quantitative step one analysis was not necessary additionally based on the results of the quantitative step one analysis for one of our reporting units it was determined that the fair value significantly exceeded the reporting units carrying value we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during 2018 2017 or 2016 

by definition assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain a significant change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit such as declines in business performance changes in government fiscal policies deterioration in market conditions adverse estimates of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of equity could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment charge to earnings in a future period 

intangible assets impairment 

intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally indefinitelived intangible assets are not being amortized until such time that the useful life is determined to no longer be indefinite 

there were no intangible asset impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  the net carrying value of intangible assets as of december 28 2018  was 652 million  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities under this method changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in income in the period such changes are enacted the provision for federal state foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 

recording our provision for income taxes requires management to make significant judgments and estimates for matters whose ultimate resolution may not become known until the final resolution of an examination by the irs or state agencies additionally recording liabilities for uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and developing our best estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid 

leidos holdings inc annual report  46 

part ii 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes 

we also recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination and settlement with various taxing authorities liabilities for uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we have experienced years when liabilities for uncertain tax positions were settled for amounts different from recorded amounts as described in  note 20—income taxes  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the normal course of business our current market risk exposures are primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments contains forwardlooking statements 

interest rate risk   

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to longterm debt obligations and derivatives our policy authorizes with board of directors approval the limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific interest rate risks 

debt and derivatives 

at december 28 2018  and december 29 2017  we had 31 billion  of fixed and variable rate debt during fiscal 2016 in connection with the acquisition of the isgs business leidos inc secured a new term loan of 690 million  as a result of the acquisition leidos assumed the isgs business term loans of 18 billion  which were obtained by the isgs business immediately prior to the transactions these senior secured term loans have variable stated interest rates that are determined based on the libor rate plus a margin as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense 

we have interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows of a portion of our variable rate senior secured term loans variable rate loans under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements we receive variable interest payments based on the onemonth libor rate and pay interest at a fixed rate the interest rate swap agreements on 11 billion  of our variable rate loans had a maturity date of december 2021 and a fixed interest rate of 108  the interest rate swap agreements on 300 million  and 250 million  of our variable rate loans had a maturity date of august 2022 and fixed interest rates of 166  and 259  respectively during fiscal 2018 we terminated these interest rate swaps and entered into new interest rate swap agreements which mature in august 2025 and have a fixed interest rate of 300  to hedge the cash flows of 15 billion  of our variable rate loans the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings as of december 28 2018  and december 29 2017  the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements with respect to our variable rate senior secured loans was a 32 million  liability and a 37 million  asset respectively 

additionally we have interest rate swap agreements with respect to all of the 450 million  aggregate principal outstanding on our fixed rate 445  notes maturing in december 2020 the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our fixedrate debt to floatingrate debt tied to the changes in the sixmonth libor benchmark interest rate as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements we will receive semiannual interest payments at the coupon rate of 445  and will pay variable interest based on the sixmonth libor rate as of december 28 2018  and december 29 2017  the fair value of our interest rate swaps with respect to our fixed rate debt was a 3 million  liability and an immaterial amount respectively 

leidos holdings inc annual report  47 

part ii 

the counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we cannot predict future market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our interest rate swaps for fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  a hypothetical 10 movement in the sixmonth libor rate would result in a 15 million and 8 million amount respectively related to our annual interest expense due to the interest rate swaps for fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  a hypothetical 10 movement in the onemonth libor rate would result in a 12 million and 11 million amount respectively related to our annual interest expense due to the interest rate swaps and variable rate debt the net hypothetical 10 movement in the sixmonth and onemonth libor rates would not have a significant impact on our annual interest expense for additional information related to our interest rate swap agreements and debt see  note 14—derivative instruments  and  note 15—debt  respectively of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

cash and cash equivalents 

as of december 28 2018  and december 29 2017  our cash and cash equivalents included investments in several large institutional money market funds and bank deposits for fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  a hypothetical 10 interest rate movement would not have a significant impact on the value of our holdings or on interest income 

foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars some of our transactions are denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our or one of our subsidiaries functional currency our foreign operations represented 9  of total revenues for both fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017

key customers

the percentage of total revenues for the us government its agencies and other customers comprising more than 10  of consolidated revenues for the periods presented were as follows 

these customers have a number of subsidiary agencies that have separate budgets and procurement functions our contracts may be with the highest level of these agencies or with the subsidiary agencies of these customers 

employees 

as of december 29 2017 we employed approximately 31000  full and parttime employees in more than 28  countries worldwide the experience and expertise of our employees makes leidos capable of solving our customers most challenging technical problems approximately 39  of our employees have degrees in science technology engineering or mathematics fields nearly 1000  employees have doctoral degrees approximately 38  of our employees possess security clearances and approximately 21  of our employees are military veterans 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities under customerfunded contracts and with companyfunded internal research and development ird funds ird efforts consist of projects involving basic research applied research development and systems and other concept formulation studies ird expenses are included in selling general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to us government contracts for fiscal 2017 fiscal 2016 and the 11month period ended january 1 2016 our companyfunded ird expense was 42 million  44 million  and 29 million  respectively which as a percentage of consolidated revenues was 04  06  and 06  respectively we charge expenses for research and development activities performed under customer contracts directly to cost of revenues for those contracts 

intellectual property rights 

our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection although we do selectively seek patent protection we claim a proprietary interest in certain of our products software programs methodologies and knowhow this proprietary information is protected in confidence as trade secrets using nondisclosure agreements contracts and other definitive agreements we selectively pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties 

in connection with the performance of services and solutions the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under us governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts generally the us government may disclose or license such information to third parties including in some instances our competitors in the case of some subcontracts that we perform the prime contractor generally obtains rights to use the programs and products that we deliver under the subcontract to perform its prime contract obligations 

competition 

competition for contracts is intense and we often compete against a large number of established multinational corporations that may have greater name and brand recognition we also compete against smaller more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas as well as the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers as a result of the diverse requirements of the us government and our commercial customers we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations we believe that our principal competitors currently include the following companies 



leidos holdings inc annual report  5 

part i 

company general dynamics corporation lockheed martin corporation northrop grumman corporation bae systems plc l3 technologies inc and raytheon company 

 we compete on various factors including our technical expertise and qualified professional andor securitycleared personnel our ability to deliver innovative costeffective solutions in a timely manner successful program execution our reputation and standing with customers pricing and the size and geographic presence of our company 

the us government has indicated that it intends to increase competition for future procurement of products and services which has led to fewer sole source awards and more emphasis on costcompetitiveness and affordability the us government is also committed to maintaining a socioeconomically diverse base of suppliers which may lead to contracts being set aside for smaller businesses in addition procurement initiatives to improve efficiency refocus priorities and enhance best practices could result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole which would intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs 

contract procurement 

our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government and other contracts the us government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives today us government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many us government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or prequalify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through single award contracts the predominant contracting methods through which us government agencies procure services and products include the following 



leidos holdings inc annual report  6 

part i 

awarded to any of the preestablished contractors which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders multipleaward idiq contracts that are open for any government agency to use for procurement are commonly referred to as governmentwide acquisition contracts idiq contracts often have multiyear terms and unfunded ceiling amounts therefore enabling but not committing the us government to purchase substantial amounts of services or products from one or more contractors at the time an idiq contract is awarded prior to the award of any task orders a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the us government will purchase under the contract and in the case of a multipleaward idiq the contractor from which such purchases may be made 

 we often partner with other companies including our competitors to submit bids for large us government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract our relationships with our partners including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program contract or customer requirements as well as the relative size qualifications capabilities customer relationships and experience of our company and our partners 

contracting with the us government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks including the us government’s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the us government issues a termination for convenience these regulations and risks are described in more detail below under business–regulation and risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

contract types 

generally the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the us government and may depend on certain factors including the type and complexity of the work to be performed degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals we generate revenues under several types of contracts including the following 



leidos holdings inc annual report  7 

part i 

costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated 

 our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts generally have lower profitability than ffp contracts 

backlog 

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed our backlog consists of funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog each of which are described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii of this annual report on form 10k we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog from us government customers as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus federal government customers included in funded backlog may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time many of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed for additional discussion and analysis of backlog see results of operations—bookings and backlog in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

the us governments fiscal year ends on september 30 of each year while not certain it is not uncommon for us government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter in addition our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter we tend to generate less revenue from our labor services during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season for selected quarterly financial data see selected quarterly financial data in part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

regulation 

we are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate we provide services and products to numerous us government agencies and entities including to the dod the us intelligence community and the dhs when working with these and other us government agencies and entities we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of contracts us government contracts generally are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far which sets forth policies procedures and 

leidos holdings inc annual report  8 

part i 

requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the us government agencyspecific regulations that implement or supplement the far such as department of defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars and other applicable laws and regulations these regulations impose a broad range of requirements many of which are unique to government contracting including various procurement import and export security contract pricing and cost contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements among other things these laws and regulations 

 the us government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time in order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance trainings relevant to their position 

some of our operations and service offerings involve access to and use by us of personally identifiable information andor protected health information these activities are regulated by extensive federal and state privacy and data security laws requiring organizations to provide certain privacy protections and security safeguards for such information 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to various foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations in addition our operations may become subject to future laws and regulations including those related to climate change and environmental sustainability see item 1a risk factors for further details although we do not currently anticipate that the costs of complying with or the liabilities associated with environmental laws will materially and adversely affect us we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future

 item 1a   risk factors 

in your evaluation of our company and business you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed and the price of our stock could decline our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as our ability to collect receivables overall us and global economic and industry conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest and exchange rates terrorism international conflicts major health concerns climate change or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially harm our business financial condition or operating results and result in a decline in the price of our stock 

risks relating to our business 

we depend on government agencies as our primary customer and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected 

we generated 84  81  and 76  of our total revenues during fiscal 2017 fiscal 2016 and the 11month period ended january 1 2016 respectively from contracts with the us government including all branches of the us military either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government we generated more than 10  of our total revenues during fiscal 2017 fiscal 2016 and the 11month period ended january 1 2016 from the us army we expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under us government contracts our reputation and relationship with the us government and in particular with the agencies of the dod and the us intelligence community are key factors in maintaining and growing our revenues negative press reports or publicity which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct conflicts of interest poor contract performance deficiencies in services reports products or other deliverables information security breaches or other aspects of our business regardless of accuracy could harm our reputation particularly with these agencies if our reputation is negatively affected or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected 

a decline in the us government budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

revenues under contracts with the dod either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors represented approximately 47  of our total revenues for fiscal 2017 levels of dod spending are difficult to predict and subject to significant risk our operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the us government or the dod as well as delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts current us government spending levels for defenserelated programs may not be sustained and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of uncertainty surrounding the federal budget increasing political pressure and legislation shifts in spending priorities from defenserelated programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors 

the us government also conducts periodic reviews of us defense strategies and priorities which may shift dod budgetary priorities reduce overall us government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defenserelated programs including programs from which we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues in addition changes to the dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so a significant decline in overall us government spending including in the areas of national security intelligence and homeland security a significant shift in its spending priorities the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defenserelated programs or significant delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

leidos holdings inc annual report  10 

part i 

because we depend on us government contracts a delay in the completion of the us governments budget process could delay procurement of the products services and solutions we provide and have an adverse effect on our future revenues 

the funding of us government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation process in years when the us government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year on september 30 government operations are typically funded pursuant to a continuing resolution which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle but does not authorize new spending initiatives when the us government operates under a continuing resolution delays can occur in the procurement of the products services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being canceled we have from time to time experienced a decline in revenues in our fourth quarter as a result of this annual budget cycle and we could experience similar declines in revenues from future delays in the budget process when the us government fails to complete its budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution a federal government shutdown may result a federal government shutdown could in turn result in our incurrence of substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts the delay or cancellation of key programs or the delay of contract payments which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results in addition when supplemental appropriations are required to operate the us government or fund specific programs and passage of legislation needed to approve any supplemental appropriation bill is delayed the overall funding environment for our business could be adversely affected 

our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties including termination of our us government contracts disqualification from bidding on future us government contracts and suspension or debarment from us government contracting 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business some significant statutes and regulations that affect us include 

 the far and many of our us government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers organizational conflicts of interest arise when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the us government impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage a conflict of interest issue that precludes our competition for or performance on a significant program or contract could harm our prospects 

the us government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies and recovery of costs among other items us government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors legislation regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of us government agencies such as increased usage of fixed price contracts multiple award contracts and small business setaside contracts could have adverse effects on government 

leidos holdings inc annual report  11 

part i 

contractors including us any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when those contracts are recompeted any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues profitability and prospects 

our business is subject to reviews audits and cost adjustments by the us government which if resolved unfavorably to us could adversely affect our profitability cash position or growth prospects 

us government agencies including the dcaa dcma and others routinely audit and review a contractors performance on government contracts indirect rates and pricing practices and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations and standards they also review the adequacy of the contractor’s compliance with government standards for its business systems including a contractors accounting system earned value management system estimating system materials management and accounting system property management system and purchasing system 

both contractors and the us government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny as a result the current audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome during the course of its current audits the dcaa is closely examining and questioning several of our long established and disclosed practices that it had previously audited and accepted increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate conclusion that will be reached 

a finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our us government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and our remediations are accepted by dcma government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds such adjustments can be applied retroactively which could result in significant customer refunds our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an approved determination of our various business systems from the responsible us government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process a determination of noncompliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations and standards could also result in the us government imposing penalties and sanctions against us including withholding of payments suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts perform contracts or compete for contracts with the us government 

indirect cost audits by the dcaa remain open for fiscal 2012  and subsequent fiscal years for leidos inc and fiscal 2011  and subsequent fiscal years for leidos innovations although we have recorded contract revenues based upon our estimate of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review we cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and if future adjustments exceed our estimates our profitability may be adversely affected 

our business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and growth prospects 

we are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to federal state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside the united states if a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions including the termination of contracts forfeiture of profits the triggering of price reduction clauses suspension of payments fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies we may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry if we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation our revenues profitability cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected more generally increases in scrutiny and investigations from government organizations legislative bodies or agencies into business practices and into major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation revenues profitability and growth prospects

misconduct of employees subcontractors agents and business partners could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation 

misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws including the antikickback act other examples could include the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal state or local government procurement regulations regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts laws and regulations relating to environmental health or safety matters bribery of foreign government officials importexport control lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims remediation costs regulatory sanctions against us loss of current and future contracts and serious harm to our reputation although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and as a result we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees subcontractors agents or business partners could damage our reputation and subject us to fines and penalties restitution or other damages loss of security clearance loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal state or local government agencies any of which would adversely affect our business reputation and our future results 

due to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability 

we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process the us government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a continuing competitive bidding process including idiq gsa schedule and other multiaward contracts which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure the competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders and to the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win following contract award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding any resulting loss or delay of startup and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues andor profitability in addition multiaward contracts require that we make sustained postaward efforts to obtain task orders under the contract as a result we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multiaward contracts our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues andor profitability 

the us government may terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and if we do not replace them this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability 

many of the us government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years these programs are normally funded on an annual basis under our contracts the us government generally has the right to not exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience any decisions by the us government to not exercise contract options or to terminate cancel modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues revenue growth and profitability 

leidos holdings inc annual report  13 

part i 

we have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts some of our contracts involve the development of complex systems and products to achieve challenging customer goals in a competitive procurement environment as a result we sometimes experience technological or other performance difficulties which have in the past and may in the future result in delays cost overruns and failures in our performance of these contracts if a government customer terminates a contract for default we may be exposed to liability including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and products from another source depending on the nature and value of the contract a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation 

we face aggressive competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects 

our business is highly competitive and we compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition financial resources and a larger technical staff we also compete with smaller more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas additionally we compete with the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology and the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address these changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products to remain competitive we must consistently provide superior service technology and performance on a costeffective basis to our customers our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide including technical qualifications past contract experience geographic presence price and the availability of qualified professional personnel in addition our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers’ needs accordingly we anticipate that larger or new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge which may adversely affect our ability to compete 

a failure to attract train and retain skilled employees including our management team would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations 

our business involves the development of tailored services and solutions for our customers a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees our continued success depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled engineering technical and professional personnel competition for skilled personnel is intense and competitors aggressively recruit key employees in addition many us government programs require contractors to have security clearances depending on the level of required clearance security clearances can be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and personnel with security clearances are in great demand particularly in highly specialized areas it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner which may affect our growth although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit train and retain qualified employees we may not be able to attract effectively train and retain these employees any failure to do so could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations efficiently and timely meet our customers’ needs and win new business which could adversely affect our future results 

in addition to attracting and retaining qualified engineering technical and professional personnel we believe that our success will also depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and its ability to retain existing business and generate new business our senior management team is important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of retaining and obtaining customer contracts in our industry particularly with agencies performing classified operations an inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives could cause us to lose customers or new business opportunities 

we may not realize as revenues the full amounts reflected in our backlog which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects 

as of december 29 2017 our total backlog was 175 billion  including 50 billion  in funded backlog due to the us governments ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our nonus government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances we may realize less than expected or may never realize revenues from some of the contracts that 

leidos holdings inc annual report  14 

part i 

are included in our backlog our unfunded backlog in particular contains management’s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues if we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog our future revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs time and resources 

we generate revenues under various types of contracts which include costreimbursement fpif tm fploe and ffp contracts our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts are generally less profitable than ffp contracts our operating results in any period may also be affected positively or negatively by customers variable purchasing patterns of our more profitable proprietary products 

our profitability is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers to varying degrees each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract while ffp contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns revenues from ffp contracts represented approximately 28  of our total revenues for fiscal 2017 when making proposals on these types of contracts we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects as well as assumptions regarding technical issues in each case our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during performance could result and in some instances has resulted in reduced profits or in losses more generally any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in the performance of our contracts including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control such as performance failures of our subcontractors natural disasters or other force majeure events could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable 

we use estimates in recognizing revenues and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues our profitability may be adversely affected 

revenues from our contracts are primarily recognized using the percentageofcompletion method or on the basis of partial performance towards completion these methodologies require estimates of total costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known changes in the underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results 

legal disputes could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability and could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims described in legal proceedings in part i of this annual report on form 10k as may be updated in our future filings with the sec including our quarterly reports on form 10q we are also subject to and may become a party to a variety of other litigation or claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation could be costly to defend and even if we are successful or if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future litigation and other claims including those described in legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future

our business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous federal state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection employment and labor relations immigration taxation anticorruption importexport controls trade restrictions internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation and anticompetition compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources we also conduct business in certain identified growth areas such as health information technology energy and environmental services which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations 

our business and financial results could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats 

as a us government contractor and a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies we handle sensitive information therefore we are continuously exposed to cyber attacks and other security threats including physical breakins any electronic or physical breakin or other security breach or compromise may jeopardize security of information stored or transmitted through our information technology systems and networks this could lead to disruptions in missioncritical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to protect against detect and mitigate these threats we face advanced and persistent attacks on our information systems and attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated these attempts include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others and may be perpetrated by wellfunded organized crime or state sponsored efforts we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence we continue to invest in and improve our threat protection detection and mitigation policies procedures and controls in addition we work with other companies in the industry and government participants on increased awareness and enhanced protections against cybersecurity threats however because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats which can be difficult to detect there can be no assurance that our policies procedures and controls have or will detect or prevent any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident we may experience similar security threats to the information technology systems that we develop install or maintain under customer contracts although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners to seek to minimize the impact of cyber and other security threats we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber or other security threats may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means occurrence of any of these security threats could expose us to claims contract terminations and damages and could adversely affect our reputation ability to work on sensitive us government contracts business operations and financial results 

internal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

any system or service disruptions including those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services whether through our shared services organization or outsourced services if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business including among other things an adverse effect on our ability to bill our customers for work performed on our contracts collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner we are also subject to systems failures including network software or hardware failures whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats natural disasters power shortages terrorist attacks or other events which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business cause us to incur remediation costs subject us to claims and damage our reputation in addition the failure or disruption of our communications could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business our property and 

leidos holdings inc annual report  16 

part i 

business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and as a result our future results could be adversely affected 

customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

many of the systems and networks that we develop install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions while we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions if a system or network that we develop install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats or other events we may experience loss of revenue remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and as a result our future results could be adversely affected 

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

we design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements 

in addition our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability such as problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

we have contracts with the us government that are classified which may limit investor insight into portions of our business 

we derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the us government that are subject to security restrictions classified programs which preclude the dissemination of information that is classified for national security purposes we are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business 

we have made and continue to make acquisitions investments joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 

we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures these transactions require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities even if successful these transactions could reduce earnings for a number of reasons including the amortization of intangible assets impairment charges acquired operations that are not yet profitable or the payment of additional consideration under earnout arrangements if an acquisition performs better than expected acquisitions investments and joint ventures pose many other risks that could adversely affect our reputation operations or financial results including 



leidos holdings inc annual report  17 

part i 

 if our acquisitions investments or joint ventures fail perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we periodically divest businesses including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan these divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources may disrupt our business distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business including through indemnification guarantee or other financial arrangements for a period of time following the transaction which would adversely affect our financial results 

goodwill and other intangible assets represent approximately 65  of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations 

intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition loss of key personnel or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government our primary customer as well as challenges in the commercial healthcare industry compounded by lower levels of us government reimbursements including reductions in medicare reimbursements which in turn impact hospital it spending adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions such as the manner in which the budget cuts are implemented including sequestration and issues related to the nation’s debt ceiling could adversely impact our future revenues and profitability these circumstances could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles also adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our profitability and financial results 

we depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors if we are not able to maintain these relationships or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer our revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors who are also often our competitors in other contexts in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services and products provided by us and the other companies will help us to win and perform 

leidos holdings inc annual report  18 

part i 

the contract our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us or if the us government terminates or reduces these other contractors’ programs does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract companies that do not have access to us government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies’ prospect of securing a future position as a prime us government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts 

we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor customer concerns about the subcontractor our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract our hiring of a subcontractor’s personnel or the subcontractor’s failure to comply with applicable law uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our subcontractors which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us if any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default a termination for default could eliminate a revenue source expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders especially if the customer is an agency of the us government 

our services and operations sometimes involve using handling or disposing of hazardous substances which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities 

some of our services and operations involve the assessment or remediation of environmental hazards as well as the use handling or disposal of hazardous substances these activities and our operations generally subject us to extensive foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations which among other things require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances furthermore failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanctions including fines penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government our current and previous ownership and operation of real property also subjects us to environmental protection laws some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property liable for hazardous substance releases even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our inspection or detection systems fail to detect bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats 

we design develop manufacture sell service and maintain various inspection systems that are designed to assist in the detection of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats in some instances we also train operators of such systems many of these systems utilize software algorithms that are probabilistic in nature and subject to significant technical limitations many of these systems are also dependent on the performance of their operators there are many factors some of which are beyond our control which could result in the failure of our products to help detect the presence of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats some of these factors could include operator error inherent limitations in our systems and misuse or malfunction of our systems the failure of our systems to help detect the presence of any of these dangerous materials could lead to injury death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability professional liability or other claims against us further if our systems fail to or are perceived to have failed to help detect a threat the negative publicity from such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims or losses 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits however not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance and for those risks we insure the limits of coverage we purchase or that are reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred if any of our thirdparty insurers fail cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from 

leidos holdings inc annual report  19 

part i 

significant product and other liability claims or losses moreover there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost if at all if liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage our business financial position operating results and prospects may be harmed regardless of the adequacy of our liability insurance coverages any significant claim may have an adverse effect on our industry and market reputation leading to a substantial decrease in demand for our products and services and reduced revenues 

we face risks associated with our international business 

our international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our us business failure to comply with us government and foreign laws and regulations applicable to international business such as the foreign corrupt practices act or us export control regulations could have an adverse impact on our business with the us government and could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties additionally these risks relating to international operations may expose us to potentially significant contract losses 

in some countries there is an increased chance for economic legal or political changes that may adversely affect the performance of our services sale of our products or repatriation of our profits international transactions can also involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability imposition of tariffs or additional taxes restrictive trade policies any delay or failure to collect amounts due to us and differing legal systems we provide services and products in support of us government customers in countries with governments that may be or may become unstable which increases the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life or damage or destruction of property or inability to meet our contractual obligations although our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues we are seeking to grow our international business in which case these regulatory geopolitical and other factors may have a greater impact on our business in the future and could adversely affect our business 

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success our failure to adequately protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position 

we rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable however trade secrets are difficult to protect although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights trademarks or other proprietary information our competitive position could be adversely affected in addition in connection with the performance of services the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts which means that us government may disclose or license our information to third parties including in some instances our competitors 

in the course of conducting our business we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims against us or our customers our contracts generally indemnify our customers for thirdparty claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide the expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results 

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod 

our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control for these reasons comparing our operating results on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance our financial results may be negatively affected by any of the risk factors listed in this risk factors section and other matters described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

accounting for many of our programs requires judgment relative to assessing risks including risks associated with estimating directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual 

leidos holdings inc annual report  20 

part i 

matters judgments associated with estimating contract revenues and costs and assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for example we must make assumptions regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials consider whether the intent of entering into multiple contracts was effectively to enter into a single project in order to determine whether such contracts should be combined or segmented consider incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating revenue and profit rates and record them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance and use estimates of award fees in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for construction and production type contracts materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

we are required to abide by potentially significant restrictions which could limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions such as the issuance of leidos common stock or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation that otherwise could be advantageous 

the merger agreement and the tax matters agreement impose certain ongoing restrictions on us to ensure that applicable statutory requirements under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and applicable treasury regulations are met so that the transactions qualify as taxfree to lockheed martin and its shareholders as a result of these restrictions our ability to engage in certain transactions may be limited 

if we take any actions that would cause the transactions to become taxable we generally will be required to bear the cost of any resulting tax liability if the transactions became taxable lockheed martin would be expected to recognize a substantial amount of income which would result in a material amount of taxes any such taxes allocated to us would be expected to be material to us and could cause our business financial condition and operating results to suffer these restrictions may reduce our ability to engage in certain business transactions that otherwise might be advantageous to us 

risks relating to our stock 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

in march 2012 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend program the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor 

some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares these restrictions which may also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors not endorsed by our current directors and management include the following 



leidos holdings inc annual report  21 

part i 

stockholders meeting or a special meeting called at the request of qualified stockholders as provided in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws 

 as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain restrictions on business combinations under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15  or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things our board of directors has approved the business combination or the transaction pursuant to which such person became a 15  holder prior to the time the person became a 15  holder

our significant initiatives include the following 

 sales trend for fiscal 2017 revenues increased by 31 billion  or 44  compared to fiscal 2016 primarily attributable to the information systems  global solutions business the isgs business of lockheed martin corporation acquired during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and growth in airborne programs the increase was partially offset by   fiscal 2016 revenues from the divestiture of the heavy construction business net volume decreases and   lower revenues from our international business  

for fiscal 2016 revenues increased by 23 billion  or 49  compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 primarily attributable to the acquired isgs business the revenue increase is also due to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit writeups on certain contracts see results of operations below for further discussion of our segment results 

operating expenses and income trend for fiscal 2017 operating expenses increased by 30 billion  or 45    compared to fiscal 2016 primarily attributable to the acquired isgs business operating margin for fiscal 2017 was 55  compared to 59  for fiscal 2016 the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to   a contract writeup in fiscal 2016 along with an increase in integration costs and restructuring expenses partially offset by a decrease in acquisition costs  for fiscal 2017 our operating income was 559 million  a 142 million  increase compared to fiscal 2016 the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the operating results of the acquired isgs business 

for fiscal 2016 operating expenses increased by 22 billion  or 51  compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 primarily attributable to the acquired isgs business operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 59  compared to 68  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred during fiscal 2016 related to the acquisition of the isgs business for fiscal 2016 our operating income was 417 million  a 97 million  increase compared to the 11month period 

leidos holdings inc annual report  32 

part ii 

ended january 1 2016 the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the operating results of the acquired isgs business 

from a macroeconomic perspective our industry is under general competitive pressures due to spending from our largest customer the us government and has required and will require a higher level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive although the current administration has indicated a desire to increase spending primarily in the defense and homeland security sectors the likelihood extent and duration of higher spending in these areas remains unclear we continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts we segregate our backlog into two categories as follows

the estimated value of our total backlog for the periods presented was as follows 

total backlog at december 29 2017 and december 30 2016 included a favorable impact of 167 million  and an unfavorable impact of 638 million  respectively due to the movements between the us dollar and the british pound 

bookings and backlog fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards renewals modifications and cancellations contract awards may be negatively impacted by ongoing industrywide delays in procurement decisions and budget cuts by the us government as discussed in “business environment and trends” in this annual report on form 10k 

we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus federal government customers may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed 

contract types 

our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract for a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenue see “business—contract types” in part i of this annual report on form 10k revenues by contract type as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods presented were as follows

stock repurchases of leidos common stock may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties including through accelerated share repurchase agreements whether repurchases are made and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including price corporate capital requirements other market conditions and regulatory requirements the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 there were no open market repurchases of our common stock

summary of cash flows 

the following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 77 million  for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the increase was primarily due to the favorable timing of working capital changes partially offset by higher integration and restructuring costs and higher payments for interest and taxes 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 67 million  for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the increase was primarily due to timing of collections of receivables and early funding for employee benefit programs of 30 million in the 11month period ended january 1 2016 partially offset by payments for acquisition and integration expenses prefunding isgs expenses in accordance with the transition services agreement with lockheed martin and increased interest payments in fiscal 2016 

net cash used in investing activities increased 97 million  for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the increase was primarily due to cash acquired as part of the acquisition of the isgs business in fiscal 2016 proceeds received from the divestiture of the heavy construction business in fiscal 2016 and higher purchases of property plant and equipment 

net cash provided by investing activities decreased by 44 million  for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the remaining building parcels of land and the multilevel surface parking garage of our former headquarters of 70 million in the 11month period ended january 1 2016 this was partially offset by cash acquired as part of the acquisition of the isgs business of 25 million  in fiscal 2016 and 13 million  paid for income tax related matters in connection with a prior acquisition in the 11month period ended january 1 2016 we did not have cash flows from investing activities for the month of january 2015 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 322 million  for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease was primarily due to a special dividend cash payment in connection with the transactions of 993 million  in fiscal 2016 and decreased payments of longterm debt of 68 million  partially offset by net proceeds from debt issuance activity of 660 million  in fiscal 2016 as well as higher dividend payments of 56 million  and less proceeds from issuances of stock of 12 million  

net cash used in financing activities increased 500 million  for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the increase was primarily due to a special cash dividend payment in connection with the transactions of 993 million  increased payments of longterm debt of 238 million  and increased dividend payments of 49 million  partially offset by net proceeds from debt issuance activity of 660 million a decrease in stock repurchases of  94 million  primarily related to the may 2015 accelerated share repurchase and additional proceeds from issuances of stock of 19 million

critical accounting policies 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates and assumptions have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current and best available information the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 revenue recognition 

we generate our revenues from various types of contracts which include firmfixedprice timeandmaterials fixedpricelevelofeffort costplusfixedfee costplusawardfee costplusincentivefee and fixedpriceincentive fee contracts 

firmfixedprice contracts—revenues and fees on these contracts that are system integration or engineering in nature are primarily recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting utilizing the costtocost method the completed contract method is utilized when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made 

timeandmaterials contracts—revenue is recognized on timeandmaterials contracts based on the hours provided in performance under the contract multiplied by the negotiated contract billing rates plus the negotiated contract billing rate of any allowable material and subcontract costs and outofpocket expenses 

fixedpricelevelofeffort contracts fploe—these contracts are substantially similar to timeandmaterials contracts except they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time accordingly we recognize revenue on fploe contracts with the us government in a manner similar to timeandmaterials contracts in which we measure progress toward completion based on the hours provided in performance under the contract multiplied by the negotiated contract billing rates plus the negotiated contract billing rate of any allowable material costs and outofpocket expenses 

costplusfixedfee contracts—revenue is recognized on costplusfixedfee contracts with the us government on the basis of partial performance equal to costs incurred plus an estimate of applicable fees earned as we become contractually entitled to reimbursement of costs and the applicable fees 

costplusawardfeecostplusincentive fee contracts—revenues and fees on these contracts with the us government are recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting using the costtocost method we include an estimate of the ultimate incentive or award fee to be received on the contract in the estimate of contract revenues for purposes of applying the percentageofcompletion method of accounting 

fixedpriceincentive fee fpif contracts—contracts are substantially similar to costplusincentivefee contracts recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting except they require specified targets for cost and profit price ceiling but not a profit ceiling or floor and profit adjustment formula under an fpif contract the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to a costshare arrangement which affects 

leidos holdings inc annual report  45 

part ii 

profitability generally if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated 

revenues from services and maintenance contracts notwithstanding contract type are recognized over the term of the respective contracts as the services are performed and revenue is earned revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from the sale of manufactured products are recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer which is generally upon delivery provided that all other requirements for revenue recognition have been met 

we also use the effortsexpended method of percentageofcompletion using measures such as labor dollars for measuring progress toward completion in situations in which this approach is more representative of the progress on the contract for example the effortsexpended method is utilized when there are significant amounts of materials or hardware procured for the contract that is not representative of progress on the contract additionally we utilize the unitsofdelivery method under percentageofcompletion on contracts where separate units of output are produced under the unitsofdelivery method revenue is generally recognized when the units are delivered to the customer provided that all other requirements for revenue recognition have been met 

we also evaluate contracts for multiple elements and when appropriate separate the contracts into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition revenues generated from product sales do not represent a material amount of our total revenues 

we generally provide for anticipated losses on contracts by recording an expense during the period in which the losses are determined amounts billed and collected but not yet recognized as revenues under contracts are deferred contract costs incurred for us government contracts including indirect costs are subject to audit and adjustment through negotiations between us and government representatives our indirect cost audits by the defense contract audit agency remain open for fiscal 2012  and subsequent fiscal years for leidos inc and for fiscal 2011  and subsequent fiscal years for leidos innovations revenues on us government contracts have been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final settlement 

contract claims are unanticipated additional costs incurred but not provided for in the executed contract price that we seek to recover from the customer such costs are expensed as incurred additional revenue related to contract claims is recognized when the amounts are awarded by the customer unpriced change orders are included in revenue when they are probable of recovery in an amount at least equal to the cost 

on certain contracts where we are not the primary obligor such as the provision of administrative oversight andor management of governmentowned facilities or support services related to other vendors products we recognize as revenues the net management fee associated with the services and exclude from our income statement the gross sales and costs associated with the facility or other vendors products 

changes in estimates on contracts 

changes in estimates related to longterm contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting are recognized in the period in which such changes are made for the inceptiontodate effect of the changes with the exception of contracts acquired through the acquisition of the isgs business where the adjustment is for the period commencing from the date of acquisition changes in these estimates can occur over the contract performance period for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope contract cost estimates and estimated incentive or award fees 

changes in estimates on contracts for the periods presented were as follows

the impact on diluted eps from continuing operations attributable to leidos common stockholders is calculated using our statutory tax rate 

business combinations 

the accounting for business combinations requires management to make judgments and estimates of the fair value of assets acquired including the identification and valuation of intangible assets as well as the liabilities and contingencies assumed such judgments and estimates directly impact the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with each acquisition 

goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level and tested more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable during fiscal 2017 we had five reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment our policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 

in january 2017 a new accounting standard was issued related to the evaluation of goodwill impairment goodwill was previously evaluated for impairment either using a qualitative assessment option step zero or a twostep quantitative approach depending on the facts and circumstances of a reporting unit the new standard eliminated the second step from goodwill impairment testing we adopted the new standard during the first quarter of 2017 

when performing a qualitative assessment we consider factors including but not limited to current macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors financial performance and other events relevant to the entity or reporting unit under evaluation to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed we performed a qualitative analysis for certain of our reporting units and a quantitative analysis for the remaining reporting units for fiscal 2016 a quantitative analysis was performed for all reporting units for fiscal 2017 

under previous guidance when evaluating the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying value no further analysis was required if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value calculated in the first step if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment charge equal to the difference 

under the new guidance goodwill is impaired for the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value up to the carrying value of goodwill 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using both market and income approaches when a quantitative analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the reporting units the outputs from both methods are equally weighted 

the market approach is a technique where the fair value is calculated based on fair values of publiclytraded companies that provide a reasonable basis of comparison with the reporting unit valuation ratios are selected that relate market prices to selected financial metrics from comparable companies these ratios are applied after consideration of adjustments and weightings related to financial position growth volatility working capital movement and other factors due to the fact that stock prices of comparable companies represent minority interests we also consider an acquisition control premium to reflect the impact of additional value associated with a controlling interest 

the income approach is a technique where the fair value is calculated based on present value future cash flows using riskadjusted discount rates which represent the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc for each reporting unit determination of wacc includes assessing the cost of equity and debt as of the valuation date in addition a terminal value is developed for forecasted future cash flows beyond the projection period discounted 

leidos holdings inc annual report  47 

part ii 

back to the present value the forecasts used in our estimation of fair value are developed by management based on business and market considerations 

the goodwill impairment test process and valuation model is based upon certain key assumptions that require the exercise of significant judgment and assumptions including the use of appropriate financial projections economic expectations wacc expected longterm growth rates as well as using available market data significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions and actual future results may differ from the estimates in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also requires judgment 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal 2017 indicated the estimated fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their their carrying values 

by definition assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain a significant change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit such as declines in business performance changes in government fiscal policies deterioration in market conditions adverse estimates of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of equity could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment charge to earnings in a future period 

intangible assets impairment 

intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally indefinitelived intangible assets are not being amortized until such time that the useful life is determined to no longer be indefinite 

in the 11month period ended january 1 2016 we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of 4 million  there were no intangible asset impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 the carrying value of intangible assets as of december 29 2017 was 856 million  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities under this method changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in income in the period such changes are enacted the provision for federal state foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 

recording our provision for income taxes requires management to make significant judgments and estimates for matters whose ultimate resolution may not become known until the final resolution of an examination by the irs or state agencies additionally recording liabilities for uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and developing our best estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes 

we also recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination and settlement with various taxing authorities liabilities for uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we have experienced years when liabilities for uncertain tax positions were settled for amounts different

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the normal course of business our current market risk exposures are primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments contains forwardlooking statements 

interest rate risk   

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to longterm debt obligations and derivatives our policy authorizes with board of directors approval the limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific interest rate risks 

debt and derivatives 

at december 29 2017 and december 30 2016 we had 31 billion  and 33 billion  respectively of fixed and variable rate debt during fiscal 2016 in connection with the acquisition of the isgs business leidos inc secured a new term loan of 690 million  as a result of the acquisition leidos assumed the isgs business term loans of 18 billion  which were obtained by the isgs business immediately prior to the transactions these senior secured term loans have variable stated interest rates that are determined based on the libor rate plus a margin as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense 

during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows with respect to 300 million  and 12 billion  respectively of our variable rate senior secured term loans under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements which mature in august 2022 and december 2021 respectively we will receive variable interest payments based on the onemonth libor rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate of 166  and 108  respectively the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings as of december 29 2017 and december 30 2016 the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements with respect to our variable rate senior secured loans was 37 million  and 26 million  respectively 

additionally we have interest rate swap agreements with respect to all of the 450 million  aggregate principal outstanding on our fixed rate 445  notes maturing in december 2020 the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our fixedrate debt to floatingrate debt tied to the changes in the sixmonth libor benchmark interest rate as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements we will receive semiannual interest payments at the coupon rate of 445  and will pay variable interest based on the sixmonth libor rate as of december 29 2017 and december 30 2016 the fair value of our interest rate swaps with respect to our fixed rate debt was an immaterial amount and 3 million  respectively 

the counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we cannot predict future market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our interest rate swaps for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 a hypothetical 10 movement in the sixmonth libor rate would have less than an 8 million and 6 million impact respectively on our annual interest expense due to the interest rate swaps for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 a hypothetical 10 movement in the onemonth libor rate would have less than an 11 million and 3 million impact on our annual interest expense due to the interest rate swaps and variable rate debt for additional information related to our interest rate swap agreements and debt see note 11—derivative instruments and note 12—debt respectively to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report

competition for contracts is intense and we often compete against a large number of established multinational corporations that may have greater name and brand recognition we also compete against smaller more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on particular areas as well as the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers as a result of the diverse requirements of the us government and our commercial customers we frequently collaborate with other companies to compete for large contracts and bid against these same companies in other situations we believe that our principal competitors currently include the following companies 

 we compete on various factors including our technical expertise and qualified professional andor securitycleared personnel our ability to deliver innovative costeffective solutions in a timely manner successful program execution our reputation and standing with customers pricing and the size and geographic presence of our company 

the us government has indicated that it intends to increase competition for future procurement of products and services which has led to fewer sole source awards and more emphasis on costcompetitiveness and affordability the us government is also committed to maintaining a socioeconomically diverse base of suppliers which may lead to contracts being set aside for smaller businesses in addition procurement initiatives to improve efficiency refocus priorities and enhance best practices could result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole which would intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs 

contract procurement 

our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government and other contracts the us government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives today us government customers employ several contracting methods to purchase services and products budgetary pressures and reforms in the procurement process have caused many us government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting methods that give them the ability to select multiple contract winners or prequalify certain contractors to provide services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through single award contracts the predominant contracting methods through which us government agencies procure services and products include the following

part i 

 we often partner with other companies including our competitors to submit bids for large us government procurements or other opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract our relationships with our partners including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program contract or customer requirements as well as the relative size qualifications capabilities customer relationships and experience of our company and our partners 

contracting with the us government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks including the us government’s ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed where the us government issues a termination for convenience these regulations and risks are described in more detail below under “business–regulation” and “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k

contract types 

generally the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the us government and may depend on certain factors including the type and complexity of the work to be performed degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding specified standards or goals we generate revenues under several types of contracts including the following 

 our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts generally have lower profitability than ffp contracts

backlog 

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed our backlog consists of funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog each of which are described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii of this annual report on form 10k we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog from us government customers as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus federal government customers included in funded backlog may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time many of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed for additional discussion and analysis of backlog see results of operations—bookings and backlog” in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii of this annual report on form 10k 

seasonality 

the us governments fiscal year ends on september 30 of each year while not certain it is not uncommon for us government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds which may favorably impact our third fiscal quarter in addition our quarterly results may be impacted by the number of working days in a given quarter we tend to generate less revenue from our labor services during the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season for selected quarterly financial data see note 22–selected quarterly financial data of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

regulation 

we are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate we provide services and products to numerous us government agencies and entities including to the dod the us intelligence community and the dhs when working with these and other us government agencies and entities we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of contracts us government contracts generally are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far which sets forth policies procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the us government agencyspecific regulations that implement or supplement the far such as department of defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars and other applicable laws and regulations these regulations impose a broad range of requirements many of which are unique to government contracting including various procurement import and export security contract pricing and cost contract termination and adjustment and audit requirements among other things these laws and regulations 

 the us government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time in order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations all of our employees are required to complete ethics and other compliance trainings relevant to their position

 item 1a   risk factors 

in your evaluation of our company and business you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with information included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and other documents we file with the sec the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs our business financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed and the price of our stock could decline our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies such as our ability to collect receivables overall us and global economic and industry conditions geopolitical events changes in laws or accounting rules fluctuations in interest and exchange rates terrorism international conflicts major health concerns climate change or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially harm our business financial condition or operating results and result in a decline in the price of our stock 

risks relating to our business 

we depend on government agencies as our primary customer and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected 

we generated 81  76  and 79  of our total revenues during fiscal 2016 the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively from contracts with the us government including all branches of the us military either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government we generated more than 10  of our total revenues during fiscal 2016 the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 from the us army we expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under us government contracts our reputation and relationship with the us government and in particular with the agencies of the dod and the us intelligence community are key factors in maintaining and growing our revenues negative press reports or publicity which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct conflicts of interest poor contract performance deficiencies in services reports products or other deliverables information security breaches or other aspects of our business regardless of accuracy could harm our reputation particularly with these agencies if our reputation is negatively affected or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason the amount of business with government and other customers would decrease and our future revenues and growth prospects would be adversely affected 

a decline in the us government budget changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

revenues under contracts with the dod either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors represented approximately 56  of our total revenues for fiscal 2016 levels of dod spending are difficult to predict and subject to significant risk our operating results could be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the us government or the dod as well as delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts current us government spending levels for defenserelated programs may not be sustained and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of uncertainty surrounding the federal budget increasing political pressure and legislation shifts in spending priorities from defenserelated programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors 

the us government also conducts periodic reviews of us defense strategies and priorities which may shift dod budgetary priorities reduce overall us government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defenserelated programs including programs from which we expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues in addition changes to the dod acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so a significant decline in overall us government spending including in the areas of national security intelligence and homeland security a significant shift in its spending priorities the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defenserelated programs or significant delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects 

leidos holdings inc annual report  12

because we depend on us government contracts a delay in the completion of the us government’s budget process could delay procurement of the products services and solutions we provide and have an adverse effect on our future revenues 

the funding of us government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation process in years when the us government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year on september 30 government operations are typically funded pursuant to a “continuing resolution” which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle but does not authorize new spending initiatives when the us government operates under a continuing resolution delays can occur in the procurement of the products services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being canceled we have from time to time experienced a decline in revenues in our fourth quarter as a result of this annual budget cycle and we could experience similar declines in revenues from future delays in the budget process in years when the us government fails to complete its budget process or to provide for a continuing resolution a federal government shutdown may result a federal government shutdown could in turn result in our incurrence of substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts or the delay or cancellation of key programs which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results in addition when supplemental appropriations are required to operate the us government or fund specific programs and passage of legislation needed to approve any supplemental appropriation bill is delayed the overall funding environment for our business could be adversely affected 

our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties including termination of our us government contracts disqualification from bidding on future us government contracts and suspension or debarment from us government contracting 

we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation administration and performance of us government contracts which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business some significant statutes and regulations that affect us include 

 the far and many of our us government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers organizational conflicts of interest arise when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the us government impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage a conflict of interest issue that precludes our competition for or performance on a significant program or contract could harm our prospects

the us government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time 

our industry has experienced and we expect it will continue to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability efficiencies and recovery of costs among other items us government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors legislation regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of us government agencies such as increased usage of fixed price contracts multiple award contracts and small business setaside contracts could have adverse effects on government contractors including us any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when those contracts are recompeted any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues profitability and prospects 

our business is subject to reviews audits and cost adjustments by the us government which if resolved unfavorably to us could adversely affect our profitability cash position or growth prospects 

us government agencies including the dcaa dcma and others routinely audit and review a contractor’s performance on government contracts indirect rates and pricing practices and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations and standards they also review the adequacy of the contractor’s compliance with government standards for its business systems including a contractor’s accounting system earned value management system estimating system materials management and accounting system property management system and purchasing system 

both contractors and the us government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny as a result the current audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome during the course of its current audits the dcaa is closely examining and questioning several of our long established and disclosed practices that it had previously audited and accepted increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate conclusion that will be reached 

a finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our us government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and our remediations are accepted by dcma government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds such adjustments can be applied retroactively which could result in significant customer refunds our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an “approved” determination of our various business systems from the responsible us government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process a determination of noncompliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws regulations and standards could also result in the us government imposing penalties and sanctions against us including withholding of payments suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts perform contracts or compete for contracts with the us government 

leidos incs indirect cost audits by the dcaa remain open for fiscal 2012  and subsequent fiscal years although we have recorded contract revenues subsequent to and including fiscal 2012  based upon our estimate of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review we do not know the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and if future adjustments exceed our estimates our profitability would be adversely affected

our business is subject to governmental review and investigation which could adversely affect our financial position operating results and growth prospects 

we are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to federal state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside the united states if a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions including the termination of contracts forfeiture of profits the triggering of price reduction clauses suspension of payments fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies we may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry if we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation our revenues profitability cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected more generally increases in scrutiny and investigations from government organizations legislative bodies or agencies into business practices and into major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation revenues profitability and growth prospects 

misconduct of employees subcontractors agents and business partners could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation 

misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws including the antikickback act other examples could include the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal state or local government procurement regulations regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts laws and regulations relating to environmental health or safety matters bribery of foreign government officials importexport control lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims remediation costs regulatory sanctions against us loss of current and future contracts and serious harm to our reputation although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and as a result we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees subcontractors agents or business partners could damage our reputation and subject us to fines and penalties restitution or other damages loss of security clearance loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal state or local government agencies any of which would adversely affect our business reputation and our future results 

due to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability 

we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process the us government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process including idiq gsa schedule and other multiaward contracts which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure the competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders and to the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win following contract award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding any resulting loss or delay of startup and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues andor profitability in addition multiaward contracts require that we make sustained postaward efforts to obtain task orders under the contract as a result we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multiaward contracts our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues andor profitability

the us government may terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and if we do not replace them this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability 

many of the us government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years these programs are normally funded on an annual basis under our contracts the us government generally has the right to not exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate cancel modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience any decisions by the us government to not exercise contract options or to terminate cancel modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues revenue growth and profitability 

we have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts some of our contracts involve the development of complex systems and products to achieve challenging customer goals in a competitive procurement environment as a result we sometimes experience technological or other performance difficulties which have in the past and may in the future result in delays cost overruns and failures in our performance of these contracts if a government customer terminates a contract for default we may be exposed to liability including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and products from another source depending on the nature and value of the contract a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation 

we face aggressive competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects 

our business is highly competitive and we compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition financial resources and a larger technical staff we also compete with smaller more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas additionally we compete with the us government’s own capabilities and federal nonprofit contract research centers 

the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology and the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly accordingly our success depends on our ability to develop services and products that address these changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products to remain competitive we must consistently provide superior service technology and performance on a costeffective basis to our customers our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide including technical qualifications past contract experience geographic presence price and the availability of qualified professional personnel in addition our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers’ needs accordingly we anticipate that larger or new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge which may adversely affect our ability to compete 

a failure to attract train and retain skilled employees including our management team would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations 

our business involves the development of tailored services and solutions for our customers a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees our continued success depends on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled engineering technical and professional personnel competition for skilled personnel is intense and competitors aggressively recruit key employees in addition many us government programs require contractors to have security clearances depending on the level of required clearance security clearances can be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and personnel with security clearances are in great demand particularly in highly specialized areas it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner which may affect our growth although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit train and retain qualified employees we may not be able to attract effectively train and retain these employees any failure to do so could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations efficiently and timely meet our customers’ needs and win new business which could adversely affect our future results 

leidos holdings inc annual report  16 

part i 

in addition to attracting and retaining qualified engineering technical and professional personnel we believe that our success will also depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and its ability to retain existing business and generate new business our senior management team is important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of retaining and obtaining customer contracts in our industry particularly with agencies performing classified operations an inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives could cause us to lose customers or new business opportunities 

we may not realize as revenues the full amounts reflected in our backlog which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects 

as of december 30 2016 our total backlog was 177 billion  including 60 billion  in funded backlog due to the us government’s ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our nonus government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances we may realize less than expected or may never realize revenues from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog our unfunded backlog in particular contains management’s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues if we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog our future revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs time and resources 

we generate revenues under various types of contracts which include costreimbursement fpif tm fploe and ffp contracts our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract the nature of services or products provided as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees particularly under incentive and award fee contracts is finally determined costreimbursement and tm contracts are generally less profitable than ffp contracts our operating results in any period may also be affected positively or negatively by customers variable purchasing patterns of our more profitable proprietary products 

our profitability is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers to varying degrees each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract while ffp contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns revenues from ffp contracts represented approximately 30  of our total revenues for fiscal 2016 when making proposals on these types of contracts we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects as well as assumptions regarding technical issues in each case our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during performance could result and in some instances has resulted in reduced profits or in losses more generally any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in the performance of our contracts including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control such as performance failures of our subcontractors natural disasters or other force majeure events could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable 

we use estimates in recognizing revenues and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues our profitability may be adversely affected 

revenues from our contracts are primarily recognized using the percentageofcompletion method or on the basis of partial performance towards completion these methodologies require estimates of total costs at completion fees earned on the contract or both this estimation process particularly due to the technical nature of the services performed and the longterm nature of certain contracts is complex and involves significant judgment adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses experience is gained and additional information becomes known even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known changes in the underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results

legal disputes could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability and could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims described in “legal proceedings” in part i of this annual report on form 10k as may be updated in our future filings with the sec including our quarterly reports on form 10q we are also subject to and may become a party to a variety of other litigation or claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages penalties or injunctive relief against us any claims or litigation could be costly to defend and even if we are successful or if fully indemnified or insured could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future litigation and other claims including those described in “legal proceedings” are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future 

our business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements and any violation of these requirements could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous federal state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection employment and labor relations immigration taxation anticorruption importexport controls trade restrictions internal and disclosure control obligations securities regulation and anticompetition compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly timeconsuming and requires significant resources we also conduct business in certain identified growth areas such as health information technology energy and environmental services which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages criminal sanctions against us or our officers prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages fines andor criminal prosecution unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations

our business and financial results could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats 

as a us government contractor and a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies we handle sensitive information therefore we are continuously exposed to cyber attacks and other security threats including physical breakins any electronic or physical breakin or other security breach or compromise may jeopardize security of information stored or transmitted through our information technology systems and networks this could lead to disruptions in missioncritical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data although we have implemented policies procedures and controls to protect against detect and mitigate these threats we face advanced and persistent attacks on our information systems and attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated these attempts include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users among others and may be perpetrated by wellfunded organized crime or state sponsored efforts we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence we continue to invest in and improve our threat protection detection and mitigation policies procedures and controls in addition we work with other companies in the industry and government participants on increased awareness and enhanced protections against cybersecurity threats however because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats which can be difficult to detect there can be no assurance that our policies procedures and controls have or will detect or prevent any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident we may experience similar security threats to the information technology systems that we develop install or maintain under customer contracts although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners to seek to minimize the impact of cyber and other security threats we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber or other security threats may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means occurrence of any of these security threats could expose us to claims contract terminations and damages and could adversely affect our reputation ability to work on sensitive us government contracts business operations and financial results 

internal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

any system or service disruptions including those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services whether through our shared services organization or outsourced services if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business including among other things an adverse effect on our ability to bill our customers for work performed on our contracts collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner we are also subject to systems failures including network software or hardware failures whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats natural disasters power shortages terrorist attacks or other events which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business cause us to incur remediation costs subject us to claims and damage our reputation in addition the failure or disruption of our communications could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and as a result our future results could be adversely affected 

customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 

many of the systems and networks that we develop install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions while we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions if a system or network that we develop install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption whether caused by us thirdparty service providers cybersecurity threats or other events we may experience loss of revenue remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and as a result our future results could be adversely affected

many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities are technologically complex or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects 

we design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design technology licensing and patent rights labor learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements 

in addition our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability such as problems with quality and workmanship country of origin delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems loss of followon work and in the case of certain contracts repayment to the government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received 

we have contracts with the us government that are classified which may limit investor insight into portions of our business 

we derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the us government that are subject to security restrictions classified programs which preclude the dissemination of information that is classified for national security purposes we are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs as a result investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business 

we have made and continue to make acquisitions investments joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 

we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions investments and joint ventures these transactions require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities even if successful these transactions could reduce earnings for a number of reasons including the amortization of intangible assets impairment charges acquired operations that are not yet profitable or the payment of additional consideration under earnout arrangements if an acquisition performs better than expected acquisitions investments and joint ventures pose many other risks that could adversely affect our reputation operations or financial results including

 if our acquisitions investments or joint ventures fail perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we periodically divest businesses including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan these divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources may disrupt our business distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business including through indemnification guarantee or other financial arrangements for a period of time following the transaction which would adversely affect our financial results 

goodwill and other intangible assets represent approximately 68  of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations 

intangible assets with indefinite lives including goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate an adverse action or assessment by a regulator unanticipated competition loss of key personnel or a morelikelythannot expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government our primary customer as well as challenges in the commercial healthcare industry compounded by lower levels of us government reimbursements including reductions in medicare reimbursements which in turn impact hospital it spending adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions such as the manner in which the budget cuts are implemented including sequestration and issues related to the nation’s debt ceiling could adversely impact our future revenues and profitability these circumstances could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles also adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our profitability and financial results 

we depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors if we are not able to maintain these relationships or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer our revenues profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected 

we rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services and products provided by us and the other companies will help us to win and perform the contract our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us or if the us government terminates or reduces these other contractors’ programs does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract companies that do not have access to us government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies’ prospect of securing a future position as a prime us government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts 

leidos holdings inc annual report  21

we may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor customer concerns about the subcontractor our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract our hiring of a subcontractor’s personnel or the subcontractor’s failure to comply with applicable law uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our subcontractors which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us if any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default a termination for default could eliminate a revenue source expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders especially if the customer is an agency of the us government 

we provide professional engineering and other services including engineeringprocurementconstruction design build project delivery and commissioning in connection with complex projects that involve significant risks and may require longterm capital 

in connection with certain projects we may commit to a specific completion date or performance standards which may expose us to significant additional costs and reputational damage if we miss the completion date or fail to achieve the performance standards including agreed upon financial damages project performance can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control including delays from governmental inaction public opposition inability to obtain financing weather unavailability or increased price of materials changes in project scope accidents environmental hazards labor disruptions and other factors if we assume risks related to these events such risks may not be insurable or may only be insurable on unacceptable terms if these events occur the total project costs could exceed our estimates and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases incur a loss on a project which may reduce or eliminate overall profitability and have an adverse effect on our financial position and cash flows 

we sold our biomasspowered generating facility in plainfield connecticut with consideration consisting of a secured promissory note a default on the note by the buyer could result in a writeoff of a portion or entire value of the note and may adversely affect our profitability 

on july 24 2015 we completed the sale of our plainfield renewable energy biomasspowered generating facility with consideration received at closing that included a secured promissory note for 73 million  net of discount the note even though we have no reason to believe a credit risk currently exists there is a possibility that the buyer could default in the event of a default we may need to write off up to the full value of the note which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

our services and operations sometimes involve using handling or disposing of hazardous substances which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities 

some of our services and operations involve the assessment or remediation of environmental hazards as well as the use handling or disposal of hazardous substances these activities and our operations generally subject us to extensive foreign federal state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations which among other things require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances furthermore failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil criminal regulatory administrative or contractual sanctions including fines penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government our current and previous ownership and operation of real property also subjects us to environmental protection laws some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property liable for hazardous substance releases even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases if we have any violations of or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected

we could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our inspection or detection systems fail to detect bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats 

we design develop manufacture sell service and maintain various inspection systems that are designed to assist in the detection of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats in some instances we also train operators of such systems many of these systems utilize software algorithms that are probabilistic in nature and subject to significant technical limitations many of these systems are also dependent on the performance of their operators there are many factors some of which are beyond our control which could result in the failure of our products to help detect the presence of bombs explosives weapons contraband or other threats some of these factors could include operator error inherent limitations in our systems and misuse or malfunction of our systems the failure of our systems to help detect the presence of any of these dangerous materials could lead to injury death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability professional liability or other claims against us further if our systems fail to or are perceived to have failed to help detect a threat the negative publicity from such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims or losses 

we maintain insurance coverage with thirdparty insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits however not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance and for those risks we insure the limits of coverage we purchase or that are reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred if any of our thirdparty insurers fail cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant product and other liability claims or losses moreover there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost if at all if liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage our business financial position operating results and prospects may be harmed regardless of the adequacy of our liability insurance coverages any significant claim may have an adverse effect on our industry and market reputation leading to a substantial decrease in demand for our products and services and reduced revenues 

we face risks associated with our international business 

our international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our us business failure to comply with us government laws and regulations applicable to international business such as the foreign corrupt practices act or us export control regulations could have an adverse impact on our business with the us government and could expose us to administrative civil or criminal penalties additionally these risks relating to international operations may expose us to potentially significant contract losses 

in some countries there is an increased chance for economic legal or political changes that may adversely affect the performance of our services sale of our products or repatriation of our profits international transactions can also involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability imposition of tariffs or additional taxes restrictive trade policies any delay or failure to collect amounts due to us and differing legal systems we provide services and products in support of us government customers in countries with governments that may be or may become unstable which increases the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life or damage or destruction of property or inability to meet our contractual obligations although our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues we are seeking to grow our international business in which case these regulatory geopolitical and other factors may have a greater impact on our business in the future and could adversely affect our business 

leidos holdings inc annual report  23

we have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights which are important to our success our failure to adequately protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position 

we rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable however trade secrets are difficult to protect although our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information we may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position if we are unable to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our copyrights trademarks or other proprietary information our competitive position could be adversely affected in addition in connection with the performance of services the us government has certain rights to inventions data software codes and related material that we develop under governmentfunded contracts and subcontracts which means that us government may disclose or license our information to third parties including in some instances our competitors 

in the course of conducting our business we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others resulting in claims against us or our customers our contracts generally indemnify our customers for thirdparty claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide the expense of defending these claims may adversely affect our financial results 

our financial results may vary significantly from periodtoperiod 

our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many of which are outside of our control for these reasons comparing our operating results on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance our financial results may be negatively affected by any of the risk factors listed in this “risk factors” section and other matters described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

we use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results 

accounting for many of our programs requires judgment relative to assessing risks including risks associated with estimating directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual matters judgments associated with estimating contract revenues and costs and assumptions for schedule and technical issues due to the size and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables for example we must make assumptions regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials consider whether the intent of entering into multiple contracts was effectively to enter into a single project in order to determine whether such contracts should be combined or segmented consider incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating revenue and profit rates and record them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance and use estimates of award fees in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for construction and production type contracts materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptions circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

the integration of leidos and splitco may not be successful or the anticipated benefits from the transactions may not be realized 

as a result of the transactions we have significantly more sales assets and employees than we did prior to the consummation of the transactions during the period in which transition services are provided to us by lockheed martin splitco has a continued dependence on the provision of services from lockheed martin including with respect to information technology infrastructure the integration process requires us to expend capital and significantly expand the scope of our operations our management is required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the process of integrating the operations of our business and the splitco business there is a significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process these difficulties include but are not limited to 

leidos holdings inc annual report  24 

part i 

 all of the risks associated with the integration process could be exacerbated by the fact that we may not have a sufficient number of employees with the requisite expertise to integrate the businesses or to operate our business failure to hire or retain employees with the requisite skills and knowledge to run leidos may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

even if we are able to combine the two business operations successfully it may not be possible to realize the benefits of the increased sales volume and other benefits including the expected synergies that are expected to result from the transactions or realize these benefits within the time frame that is expected for example the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated or the benefits from the transactions may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the companies in addition the quantification of synergies expected to result from the transactions is based on significant estimates and assumptions that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain the amount of synergies actually realized in the transactions if any and the time periods in which any such synergies are realized could differ materially from the expected synergies discussed in this document regardless of whether we are able to combine the two business operations successfully 

if we are unable to successfully integrate the splitco business or if we are unable to realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the transactions there could be a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are required to abide by potentially significant restrictions which could limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions such as the issuance of leidos common stock or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation that otherwise could be advantageous 

the merger agreement and the tax matters agreement impose certain ongoing restrictions on us to ensure that applicable statutory requirements under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and applicable treasury regulations are met so that the transactions qualify as taxfree to lockheed martin and its shareholders as a result of these restrictions our ability to engage in certain transactions may be limited 

if we take any actions that would cause the transactions to become taxable we generally will be required to bear the cost of any resulting tax liability if the transactions became taxable lockheed martin would be expected to recognize a substantial amount of income which would result in a material amount of taxes any such taxes allocated to us would be expected to be material to us and could cause our business financial condition and operating results to suffer these restrictions may reduce our ability to engage in certain business transactions that otherwise might be advantageous to us 

leidos holdings inc annual report  25

we incurred new indebtedness in connection with the transactions and the degree to which leidos is leveraged may have a material adverse effect on leidos business financial condition or results of operations and cash flows 

certain financial institutions provided financing to splitco to finance the amount of the splitco debt and to leidos to fund the special dividend for which the company paid 993 million  to its stockholders and accrued 29 million  of dividend equivalents with respect to outstanding equity awards leidos ability to make payments on and to refinance its indebtedness including the debt incurred pursuant to the transactions as well as any future debt that leidos may incur will depend on among other things leidos ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales leidos ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond leidos control 

if leidos is not able to repay or refinance its debt as it becomes due leidos may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of leidos cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on leidos indebtedness in addition leidos ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in leidos industry could be impaired the lenders who hold such debt could also potentially accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of leidos other debt 

in addition leidos may increase its debt or raise additional capital subject to restrictions in leidos debt agreements and agreements entered into in connection with the transactions if leidos cash flow from operations is less than it anticipates or if leidos cash requirements are more than it expects leidos may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to leidos on terms acceptable to leidos if at all if leidos incurs additional debt or raises equity through the issuance of preferred stock the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of leidos common stock particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on leidos operations than it currently has if leidos raises funds through the issuance of additional equity your percentage ownership in leidos would be diluted if leidos is unable to raise additional capital when needed it could affect leidos financial condition which could negatively affect your investment in leidos also regardless of the terms of leidos debt or equity financing the amount of leidos stock that it can issue may be limited because the issuance of leidos stock may cause the distribution as defined below in item 7 to be a taxable event for lockheed martin and under the tax matters agreement leidos could be required to indemnify lockheed martin for the resulting tax 

we will incur significant costs related to the transactions that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity cash flows and operating results 

we expect to incur approximately 235 million  of onetime transition and integrationrelated costs a portion of which will be incremental capital spending which management believes are necessary to realize the anticipated synergies from the transactions the incurrence of these costs may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity cash flows and operating results in the periods in which they are incurred we may be able to recover approximately 90 million  of the transition and integrationrelated expenses as allocable costs through its costtype contracts over a five year  period but there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so the identification and implementation of additional anticipated synergies particularly in reduced real estate footprint and systems consolidation opportunities may result in additional onetime integration costs 

we may be unable to provide the same types and level of benefits services and resources to splitco that historically have been provided by lockheed martin or may be unable to provide them at the same cost 

as part of lockheed martin splitco received benefits and services from lockheed martin and benefited from lockheed martin’s financial strength and extensive business relationships as a result of the transactions splitco is now a wholly owned subsidiary of leidos and no longer will benefit from lockheed martin’s resources while we have entered into agreements under which lockheed martin has agreed to provide certain transition services and siterelated services for a period of time following the consummation of the transactions it cannot be assured that we will be able to adequately replace those resources or replace them at the same cost if we are not able to replace the resources provided by lockheed martin or are unable to replace them at the same cost or are delayed in replacing the resources provided by lockheed martin our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted 

leidos holdings inc annual report  26 

part i 

our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected as we replace certain of splitco’s contracts if we cannot negotiate contract terms that are as favorable as those lockheed martin received 

prior to the consummation of the transactions certain functions such as purchasing accounts payable processing accounts receivable management information systems logistics and distribution associated with the splitco business were performed under lockheed martin’s centralized systems and in some cases under contracts that also are used for lockheed martin’s other businesses and which were not assigned in whole or in part to splitco in addition some other contracts to which lockheed martin was a party on behalf of splitco will require consents of third parties to assign them to splitco there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate contract terms that are as favorable as those lockheed martin received when and if we replace these contracts with our own agreements for similar services including any contracts that may need to be replaced as a result of a failure to obtain required thirdparty consents although we believe that we will be able to enter into new agreements for similar services and that lockheed martin and leidos will be able to obtain all material thirdparty consents required to assign contracts to splitco it is possible that the failure to enter into new agreements for similar services or to obtain required consents to assign contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be required to recognize impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets 

the transactions added 51 billion  of goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheets as of august 16 2016 in accordance with gaap our management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect our results of operations in the periods recognized 

risks relating to our stock 

we cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock 

in march 2012 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend program the timing declaration amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors including our available cash estimated cash needs earnings financial condition operating results capital requirements as well as limitations in our contractual agreements applicable law regulatory constraints industry practice and other business considerations that our board of directors considers relevant a change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor 

some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares these restrictions which may also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors not endorsed by our current directors and management include the following

our significant initiatives include the following 

 sales trend for fiscal 2016 revenues increased by 23 billion  or 49  compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 primarily attributable to revenues within our isgs segment the revenue increase is also due to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit writeups on certain contracts for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 revenues increased by 22 million  or less than 1  to 47 billion  compared to the 11month period ended january 2 2015 primarily due to growth in our engineering construction business as well as recent awards in our federal health business and for an international logistics program this increase was partially offset by a decline in contract activities associated with support of overseas contingency operations oco contracts and continued decline in our commercial health business see results of operations below for further discussion of our segment results 

operating expenses and income trend for fiscal 2016 operating expenses increased by 22 billion  or 51  compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 primarily attributable to the new isgs segment operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 59  compared to 68  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred during fiscal 2016 related to the acquisition of the isgs business for fiscal 2016 our operating income was 417 million  a 97 million  increase compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the operating results of the newly acquired isgs business

for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 operating expenses decreased by 489 million  or 10  compared to the 11month period ended january 2 2015 operating expenses decreased at a greater rate than revenues resulting in an operating income margin of 68  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 compared to a negative operating margin of 41  for the 11month period ended january 2 2015 for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 our operating income was 320 million  a 511 million  increase compared to the 11month period ended january 2 2015 this increase in operating margin and income was primarily due to prior period goodwill and asset impairment charges and increased program margins coupled with improved product mix of higher margin security product sales see results of operations below for further discussion of our segment results 

from a macroeconomic perspective our industry is under general competitive pressures due to spending from our largest customer the us government and has required and will require a higher level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive although the new administration and congress would like to significantly increase spending primarily in the defense and homeland security sectors it remains unclear whether or not they will be able to move such legislation through the senate we continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary

divestitures 

discontinued operations 

in addition to the spinoff of new saic discussed above in order to better align our business portfolio with our strategy we sold or committed to plans to dispose of certain nonstrategic components of our business in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 which are reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

in january 2014 we committed to plans to dispose of cloudshield technologies inc cloudshield historically included in our national security solutions segment which was previously acquired in fiscal 2011 and primarily focused on producing a suite of cybersecurity hardware and associated software and services the sale transaction was completed in february 2015 with received cash proceeds of 5 million  resulting in an immaterial loss on sale 

in august 2013 we committed to plans to dispose of a business historically included in our national security solutions segment that primarily focused on technology used to detect if an individual is concealing explosive devices or other hidden weapons in the first quarter ended may 2 2014 we adjusted the carrying values of the businesss assets to their fair value based on the estimated selling price of the business the carrying value exceeded the fair value which resulted in 12 million  of impairment charges recorded in discontinued operations of which 9 million  related to fixed assets and inventory and the remainder related to intangible assets the sale transaction was completed in may 2014 with insignificant cash proceeds received resulting in an immaterial loss on sale 

the operating results through the date of disposal of our discontinued operations discussed above for the periods presented were as follows

business environment and trends 

us government markets 

for fiscal 2016 we generated approximately 81  of our total revenues from contracts with the us government either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the us government revenues under contracts with the dod including subcontracts under which the dod is the ultimate purchaser represented approximately 56  of our total revenues for fiscal 2016 accordingly our business performance is affected by the overall level of us government spending especially national security homeland security and intelligence spending and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the us government 

in february 2016 the president delivered his requested budget for the government fiscal year gfy 2017 budget cycle to congress the appropriations committee began its work for the year in march 2016 and made significant progress in committee however congress failed to enact any of the 12 appropriations bills which necessitated the passage of a series of continuing resolutions cr the federal government continues to operate under a cr which expires on april 28 2017 there is a possibility of a government shutdown if congress cannot agree to a longterm budget agreement however we believe that is unlikely furthermore we expect the new administration to submit a gfy 2018 budget later in the spring and although congress and the administration are controlled by the same political party there are no guarantees that any of the 12 appropriations bills will be enacted by the end of this government fiscal year 

trends in the us government contracting process including a shift towards multipleawards contracts in which certain contractors are preapproved using indefinitedeliveryindefinitequantity idiq and us general services administration gsa contract vehicles and awarding contracts on a low price technically acceptable basis have increased competition for us government contracts reduced backlogs by shortening periods of performance on contracts and increased pricing pressure we expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process for more information on these risks and uncertainties see “risk factors” in part i of this annual report on form 10k 

international markets 

sales to customers in international markets represented 9  of total revenues for fiscal 2016 compared to 4  of total revenues for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 primarily due to our acquisition of the isgs business the acquisition has increased the relative contribution from international business particularly in the united kingdom and australia and has therefore increased our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks 

key performance measures 

the primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue operating income cash flows from operations and diluted eps we also believe that bookings and backlog are useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our performance and potential future revenues in addition we consider contract types to be a useful measure to management and investors in evaluating our operating income and margin performance

the revenue increase in constant currency 1  for fiscal 2016 was 50  as compared to an overall increase of 49  the adverse foreign currency impact was attributable to our uk business in the nss segment foreign currency impacts for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 2 2015 were immaterial 

revenues for fiscal 2016 include revenues from the recently acquired isgs business see note 2–acquisitions and the discussion on the isgs segment below 

we classify indirect costs incurred within or allocated to our us government customers as overhead included in cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses in the same manner as such costs are defined in our disclosure statements under us government cost accounting standards effective january 31 2015 we updated our disclosure statements resulting in certain costs being classified differently either as cost of revenues or as general and administrative expenses on a prospective basis these changes did not have an overall impact on the total expense or income reported 

reportable segment results 

national security solutions 



national security solutions revenues increased 400 million  or 12  for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the revenue increase was primarily attributable to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit writeups on certain contracts these increases were partially offset by reduced revenue due to lower scope and completion of certain contracts 

in constant currency revenues increased 13  for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the adverse impact of foreign currency of 1 was primarily due to the movement of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound 

national security solutions revenues decreased 127 million  or 4  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 2 2015 the revenue contraction was primarily attributable to contract activities associated with oco contracts which includes a reduction of airborne programs that support intelligence collection excluding the revenue declines associated with oco contracts the remaining revenue for the national securities solutions segment increased by 2  primarily due to an increase in our logistics program oco contracts contributed approximately 175 million  in revenues for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 

national security solutions operating income increased 29 million  or 11  for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 this increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased revenues 

national security solutions operating income decreased 7 million  or 3  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 2 2015 this decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues 

  

1  the nongaap measure of constant currency revenues is used to assess the performance of revenue activity without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we calculate revenues on a constant currency basis by translating current period revenue using the comparable periods foreign currency exchange rates this calculation is performed for all subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the us dollar

information systems  global solutions 

we acquired the isgs business on august 16 2016 see note 2–acquisitions and the business constitutes a separate reportable segment see note 19–business segments 

the operating results above reflect isgs segment performance during the period august 16 2016 through december 30 2016 

health and infrastructure 



health and infrastructure revenues decreased 33 million  or 2  for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the revenue decline is primarily attributable to the divestiture of our design build and heavy construction engineering services business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and the sale of the plainfield plant which closed in the second quarter of the prior year as well as lower revenues in our engineering services business this was partially offset by growth in the federal and commercial health businesses excluding the revenues from the divested businesses his revenues increased 232 million or 189 primarily due to growth in the federal and commercial health businesses partially offset by lower revenues in our engineering services business 

health and infrastructure revenues increased 130 million  or 10  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 2 2015 the revenue growth reflects increased revenues in our engineering construction business higher sales in the federal health business primarily due to our new electronic health record system modernization program and timing of security product shipments which was partially offset by decreased volume in the commercial health business 

health and infrastructure operating income was 162 million  for fiscal 2016 as compared to operating income of 76 million  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the increase in operating income was primarily due to 46 million of asset impairment charges and operating losses associated mainly with the plainfield plant recorded in the prior year that did not recur in fiscal 2016 along with a decrease in bad debt expense 

health and infrastructure operating income was 76 million  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 as compared to operating loss of 442 million  for the 11month period ended january 2 2015 the increase in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in asset impairment charges in our commercial health and engineering businesses primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge during fiscal 2015 of 486 million as well as higher operating income generated from our security products business due to an impairment charge in fiscal 2015 on our reveal line of security products increased volume of higher margin security products and lower indirect costs the increase in operating income was partially offset by bad debt expense associated with a renewable energy power generation facility design build project that was completed in 2013

corporate and other 



nm  not meaningful 

corporate and other operating loss represents corporate costs that are not directly related to the operating performance of the reportable segments 

corporate and other revenues decreased 7 million  for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 primarily due to proceeds received during the 11month period ended january 1 2016 related to a onetime settlement of a litigation matter of 5 million 

corporate and other revenues increased   19 million   for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 2 2015 primarily due to  a 12 million adjustment to rate reserves during the 11month period ended january 2 2015 and proceeds received during the 11month period ended january 1 2016 related to the settlement of a litigation matter of 5 million 

corporate and other operating loss increased 132 million  as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred related to the acquisition of the isgs business of 90 million  and an increase in restructuring expenses of 10 million the increase in operating loss was also attributable to a 12 million unfavorable change in real estate activity a 6 million loss recognized on our defined benefit pension plan and proceeds received during the 11month period ended january 1 2016 related to the settlement of a litigation matter of 5 million 

corporate and other operating loss was approximately 19 million  for both the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and the 11month period ended january 2 2015 respectively 

longlived asset impairment evaluations 

goodwill impairment evaluation in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 our health solutions and infrastructure reporting units within the health and infrastructure reportable segment were adversely impacted by certain unexpected events that caused us to reassess that year and future years performance expectations for both reporting units based on significant declines in forecasted revenue volumes and delayed award decisions we conducted an interim goodwill impairment test using the twostep quantitative approach 

based on the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test performed during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we determined that the carrying value of both the health solutions and infrastructure reporting units were greater than the respective estimated fair values of the reporting units and the second step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test was performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment of the respective reporting units 

as a result of the second step evaluation we recorded goodwill impairment charges in the health solutions and infrastructure reporting units of 369 million  and 117 million  respectively during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 there were no other goodwill impairment charges as part of the interim goodwill impairment test recorded for the remaining reporting units see note 5–goodwill within our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information

asset impairment 

in march 2015 we entered into a definitive membership interest purchase agreement the agreement to sell 100  of our equity membership interest in plainfield renewable energy holdings llc plainfield we adjusted the carrying values of plainfields assets to their fair values based on the estimated selling price of the business pursuant to the terms of the agreement the carrying value exceeded the fair value which resulted in approximately 40 million  of impairment charges in fiscal 2015 in the second quarter of the 11month period ended january 1 2016 further negotiations occurred related to the sale of plainfield resulting in approximately 29 million  of impairment charges we adjusted the carrying values of plainfields assets to their fair values based on the estimated selling price of the business pursuant to the terms of the amended agreement that was amended on july 17 2015 on july 24 2015 we completed the sale see note 3—divestitures within our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the sale 

restructuring expenses 

after the acquisition of the isgs business we began an initiative to review our cost structure which included optimization of our real estate portfolio by vacating facilities that were not necessary for future requirements and reducing headcount for fiscal 2016 we recognized 12 million  of restructuring expenses related to this program we anticipate this restructuring program to last through fiscal 2018 and currently expect to incur approximately 125 million  in connection with these restructuring activities 

for fiscal 2016 the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 we recorded 2 million  4 million  and 3 million  of restructuring expenses respectively related to the separation of new saic and our real estate optimization initiatives substantially all of these charges resulted from a revision of original estimates for vacating real estate leases 

equity earnings of nonconsolidated subsidiaries 

as a result of the lockheed martin transaction we received certain noncontrolling ownership interests in equity investments for fiscal 2016 we recorded earnings of 10 million  from our equity method investments 

nonoperating expense income 

nonoperating expense for fiscal 2016 was 99 million  as compared to nonoperating income of 35 million  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 this 134 million  increase in nonoperating expense was primarily attributable to the following 

 nonoperating income for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 was 35 million   as compared to nonoperating expense of 65 million  for the 11month period ended january 2 2015 this 100 million  increase in nonoperating income was primarily attributable to the following

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 226  315  and 262  in fiscal 2016 and the 11month periods ended january 1 2016 and january 2 2015 respectively the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by the tax deductibility of the special cash dividend related to the transactions on shares held by the leidos retirement plan the income tax benefits of the research tax credit and the excess tax benefits related to employee sharebased payments partially offset by the impact of certain capitalized transactions costs related to the transactions 

the effective tax rate for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 was favorably impacted by the release of the valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward for capital gains recognized during the current year as well as the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies with the tax authorities the effective tax rate for the 11month period ended january 2 2015 was negatively impacted by the goodwill impairment charge of 486 million  recorded in the quarter ended august 1 2014 which was mostly not deductible 

our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was 102 million  as of december 30 2016 and january 1 2016 

noncontrolling interest 

as a result of the lockheed martin transaction we received an interest in mission support alliance llc msa a joint venture with jacobs engineering group inc and centerra group llc we have consolidated the financial results for msa into our consolidated financial statements net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2016 was 2 million  

bookings and backlog 

we had net bookings worth an estimated 69 billion  and 68 billion  during fiscal 2016 and the 11month period ended january 1 2016 respectively net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenue to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards that were received during the year net of any adjustments to previously awarded backlog amounts we calculate net bookings as the year’s ending backlog plus the year’s revenues less the prior year’s ending backlog and less the backlog obtained in acquisitions during the year 

backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed we segregate our backlog into two categories as follows 



leidos holdings inc annual report  47 

part ii 

the estimated value of our total backlog for fiscal 2016 and the 11month period ended january 1 2016 was as follows 

total backlog at december 30 2016 included 638 million  of reduction due to the adverse impact of foreign currency movement between the us dollar and the british pound 

bookings and backlog fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards renewals modifications and cancellations contract awards may be negatively impacted by ongoing industrywide delays in procurement decisions and budget cuts by the us government as discussed in “business environment and trends” in this annual report on form 10k 

we expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months however the us government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the us government in addition certain contracts with commercial or nonus federal government customers may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed

contract types 

our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract for a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenue see “business—contract types” in part i of this annual report on form 10k the following table summarizes revenues by contract type as a percentage of our total revenue for fiscal 2016 the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 

the percentage of revenue derived from costreimbursement contracts for fiscal 2016 remained consistent with the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the percentage of revenue derived from tm and fploe contracts decreased by 3  and ffp contracts increased by 3  for fiscal 2016 from the 11month period ended january 1 2016 primarily due to the contract mix of the acquired isgs business 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of liquidity 

as of december 30 2016 we had 376 million  in cash and cash equivalents in addition in august 2016 we entered into a secured revolving credit facility which can provide up to 750 million  in secured borrowing capacity if required this new credit facility replaced the previous unsecured credit facility held that provided 500 million  of borrowing capacity during fiscal 2016 and the 11month period ended january 1 2016 there were no borrowings outstanding under either of the credit facilities and we were in compliance with the financial covenants 

in august 2016 our board of directors declared a special dividend of 1364  per share of leidos common stock consequently on august 22 2016 we paid 993 million  to stockholders of record as of august 15 2016 and accrued 29 million  of dividend equivalents with respect to the outstanding unvested equity awards in addition we paid quarterly dividends of 142 million  93 million  and 95 million  for fiscal 2016 the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively 

at december 30 2016 and january 1 2016 we had outstanding debt of 33 billion  and 11 billion  respectively the notes outstanding as of december 30 2016 contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 30 2016 

in connection with the transactions leidos has incurred 25 billion  of new indebtedness in the form of term loans see note 2–acquisitions of the 25 billion  18 billion  of the term loans was secured by leidos innovations prior to being acquired and the funds were used to finance the special cash payment to lockheed martin the remaining 690 million  of term loans was secured by leidos to fund the special cash dividend during fiscal 2016 we repaid 275 million  of these term loans see note 11–debt 

in august 2016 the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows with respect to 12 billion  of the aggregate principal outstanding on the companys variable rate senior secured notes see note 10–derivative instruments the objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of the companys variable rate secured notes 

we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market privately negotiated transactions or otherwise such repurchases if any will depend on prevailing market conditions our liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition to the 275 million  repaid in fiscal 2016 noted above we paid 36 million  and 175 million  in the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively to repurchase and retire a principal amount of 37 million  and 183 million  of outstanding debt respectively 

leidos holdings inc annual report  49 

part ii 

stock repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties including through accelerated share repurchase agreements whether repurchases are made and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including price corporate capital requirements other market conditions and regulatory requirements the repurchase program may be accelerated suspended delayed or discontinued at any time during fiscal 2016 there were no open market repurchases of our common stock 

in the 11month period ended january 1 2016 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with a financial institution to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 100 million  resulting in a delivery of 24 million  shares completed during the second quarter of the 11month period ended january 1 2016

we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs including servicing our debt through cash generated from operations available cash balances and if needed borrowings from our revolving credit facility 

summary of cash flows 

the following table summarizes cash flow information for fiscal 2016 the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 

cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased 47 million  for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the increase was primarily due to timing of collections of receivables and early funding for employee benefit programs of 30 million in the 11month period ended january 1 2016 that did not recur in fiscal 2016 partially offset by payments for acquisition and integration expenses prefunding isgs expenses in accordance with the transition services agreement with lockheed martin and increased interest payments in fiscal 2016 

cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased 3 million  for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 the increase was primarily due to a net increase in working capital of 117 million  partially offset by a decrease in net income adjusted for noncash items of 78 million  the net increase in working capital was primarily due to lower tax payments and a net increase from the timing of collections from customers and payments to vendors cash flows provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by the advancement of funding for employee benefit programs of 30 million

critical accounting policies 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates and assumptions have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current reasonably available information the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

we have several critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective and complex judgments typically the circumstances that make these judgments difficult subjective and complex have to do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain our critical accounting policies are described below 

revenue recognition 

we generate our revenues from various types of contracts which include firmfixedprice timeandmaterials fixedpricelevelofeffort costplusfixedfee costplusawardfee costplusincentivefee and fixedpriceincentive fee contracts 

firmfixedprice contracts—revenues and fees on these contracts that are system integration or engineering in nature are primarily recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting utilizing the costtocost method the completed contract method is utilized when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made 

timeandmaterials contracts—revenue is recognized on timeandmaterials contracts based on the hours provided in performance under the contract multiplied by the negotiated contract billing rates plus the negotiated contract billing rate of any allowable material and subcontract costs and outofpocket expenses 

fixedpricelevelofeffort contracts fploe—these contracts are substantially similar to timeandmaterials contracts except they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time accordingly we recognize revenue on fploe contracts with the us government in a manner similar to timeandmaterials contracts in which we measure progress toward completion based on the hours provided in performance under the contract multiplied by the negotiated contract billing rates plus the negotiated contract billing rate of any allowable material costs and outofpocket expenses 

costplusfixedfee contracts—revenue is recognized on costplusfixedfee contracts with the us government on the basis of partial performance equal to costs incurred plus an estimate of applicable fees earned as we become contractually entitled to reimbursement of costs and the applicable fees 

costplusawardfeecostplusincentive fee contracts—revenues and fees on these contracts with the us government are primarily recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting most often based on the costtocost method we include an estimate of the ultimate incentive or award fee to be received on the contract in the estimate of contract revenues for purposes of applying the percentageofcompletion method of accounting 

fixedpriceincentive fee “fpif” contracts—contracts are substantially similar to costplusincentivefee contracts recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting except they require specified targets for cost and profit price ceiling but not a profit ceiling or floor and profit adjustment formula under an fpif contract the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to a costshare arrangement which affects profitability generally if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated 

leidos holdings inc annual report  53 

part ii 

revenues from services and maintenance contracts notwithstanding contract type are recognized over the term of the respective contracts as the services are performed and revenue is earned revenues from unitpriced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output revenues from the sale of manufactured products are recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer which is generally upon delivery provided that all other requirements for revenue recognition have been met 

we also use the effortsexpended method of percentageofcompletion using measures such as labor dollars for measuring progress toward completion in situations in which this approach is more representative of the progress on the contract for example the effortsexpended method is utilized when there are significant amounts of materials or hardware procured for the contract that is not representative of progress on the contract additionally we utilize the unitsofdelivery method under percentageofcompletion on contracts where separate units of output are produced under the unitsofdelivery method revenue is generally recognized when the units are delivered to the customer provided that all other requirements for revenue recognition have been met 

we also evaluate contracts for multiple elements and when appropriate separate the contracts into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition revenues generated from product sales do not represent a material amount of the companys total revenues 

we provide for anticipated losses on contracts by recording an expense during the period in which the losses are determined amounts billed and collected but not yet recognized as revenues under contracts are deferred contract costs incurred for us government contracts including indirect costs are subject to audit and adjustment through negotiations between us and government representatives our indirect cost audits by the dcaa remain open for fiscal 2012  and subsequent fiscal years for leidos inc and for fiscal 2009  and subsequent fiscal years for leidos innovations corporation revenues on us government contracts have been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final settlement 

contract claims are unanticipated additional costs incurred but not provided for in the executed contract price that we seek to recover from the customer such costs are expensed as incurred additional revenue related to contract claims is recognized when the amounts are awarded by the customer unpriced change orders are included in revenue when they are probable of recovery in an amount at least equal to the cost 

in certain situations primarily where we are not the primary obligor on certain elements of a contract such as the provision of administrative oversight andor management of governmentowned facilities or logistical support services related to other vendors products we recognize as revenues the net management fee associated with the services and exclude from our income statement the gross sales and costs associated with the facility or other vendors products 

changes in estimates on contracts 

changes in estimates related to contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting are recognized in the period in which such changes are made for the inceptiontodate effect of the changes with the exception of isgs contracts where the adjustment is for the period commencing from the date of acquisition changes in these estimates can routinely occur over the contract performance period for a variety of reasons including changes in contract scope contract cost estimates and estimated incentive or award fees 

changes in estimates on contracts for fiscal 2016 the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 were as follows 



leidos holdings inc annual report  54 

part ii 

receivables 

our accounts receivable include amounts billed and currently due from customers for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the amounts billable within the next month were classified as billed receivables such receivables were classified as unbilled receivables for fiscal 2016 since our receivables are primarily with the us government we do not have exposure to a material credit risk unbilled receivables consist of amounts billable and contract retentions amounts billable are stated at estimated realizable value and consist of costs and fees substantially all of which are expected to be billed and collected within one year amounts billable also include rate variances that are billable upon negotiation of final indirect rates with the us government and once billed are subject to audit and approval by government representatives contract retentions are billed upon contract completion or the occurrence of a specified event and when negotiation of final indirect rates with the us government is complete consequently the timing of collection of retention balances is outside our control based on our historical experience the majority of retention balances are expected to be collected beyond one year and writeoffs of retention balances have not been significant when events or conditions indicate that amounts outstanding from customers may become uncollectible an allowance is estimated and recorded 

business combinations 

the accounting for business combinations requires management to make judgments and estimates of the fair value of assets acquired including the identification and valuation of intangible assets as well as the liabilities and contingencies assumed such judgments and estimates directly impact the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with each acquisition 

goodwill impairment 

goodwill represents purchase consideration paid in a business combination that exceeds the fair values of the net assets of acquired businesses goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on the first day of the fourth quarter and during interim periods if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

our policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 

the change in our fiscal yearend from the friday nearest the end of january to the friday nearest the end of december resulted in an annual goodwill impairment test date for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 that was approximately one month earlier than in previous years the change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date was deemed to be a change in accounting principle which we believe to be preferable the change was made to better align with our most significant customer’s fiscal year as well as our yearend reporting cycle and annual planning and budgeting process which is a significant element in the annual goodwill impairment test this change in accounting principle did not delay accelerate or avoid a goodwill impairment charge the annual goodwill impairment test was performed on november 1 2014 for fiscal 2015 and on october 3 2015 for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 such that a period greater than 12 months did not elapse between test dates the change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date was applied prospectively beginning on october 3 2015 and had no effect on the consolidated financial statements this change was not applied retrospectively as it is impracticable to objectively determine valuation estimates in prior periods 

goodwill is evaluated for impairment either under a qualitative assessment option or a twostep quantitative approach depending on the facts and circumstances of a reporting unit including consideration of the excess of fair value over carrying amount in previous assessments and changes in business environment 

when performing a qualitative assessment we consider factors including but not limited to current macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors financial performance and other events relevant to the entity or reporting unit under evaluation to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount a quantitative twostep goodwill impairment test is performed 

leidos holdings inc annual report  55 

part ii 

in evaluating the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value which includes the allocated goodwill if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying value no further analysis is required if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit’s identifiable assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value calculated in the first step if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we record an impairment charge equal to the difference 

we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using both market and income approaches when a quantitative analysis is performed 

the market approach is a technique where the fair value is calculated based on fair values of publiclytraded companies that provide a reasonable basis of comparison with the reporting unit valuation ratios are selected that relate market prices to selected financial metrics from comparable companies these ratios are applied after consideration of adjustments and weightings related to financial position growth volatility working capital movement and other factors due to the fact that stock prices of comparable companies represent minority interests we also consider an acquisition control premium to reflect the impact of additional value associated with a controlling interest 

the income approach is a technique where the fair value is calculated based on present value future cash flows using riskadjusted discount rates which represent the weightedaverage cost of capital wacc for each reporting unit determination of wacc includes assessing the cost of equity and debt as of the valuation date in addition a terminal value is developed for forecasted future cash flows beyond the projection period discounted back to the present value the forecasts used in our estimation of fair value are developed by management based on business and market considerations 

the goodwill impairment test process and valuation model is based upon certain key assumptions that require the exercise of significant judgment including judgments for the use of appropriate financial projections economic expectations discount rates and wacc as well as using available market data the goodwill impairment test process also requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions including revenue profit expected longterm growth rates and cash flow forecasts about the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned the fair values of our reporting units are based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions and actual future results may differ from the estimates in addition the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also requires judgment 

our annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal 2016 which excluded the recently acquired isgs business indicated the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values 

we face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the us government our primary customer as well as challenges in the commercial healthcare industry compounded by lower levels of us government reimbursements including reductions in medicare reimbursements which in turn impact hospital it spending adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions could adversely impact our future revenues and profitability these circumstances could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles also adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill andor other intangibles 

intangible assets impairment 

intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable additionally other indefinitelived intangible assets are not being amortized until such time that the useful life is determined to no longer be indefinite 

in the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of 4 million  and 41 million  respectively there were no intangible asset impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2016 the carrying value of intangible assets as of december 30 2016 was 16 billion  which included the preliminary fair value of intangible assets acquired 

leidos holdings inc annual report  56 

part ii 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities under this method changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in income in the period such changes are enacted the provision for federal state foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 

recording our provision for income taxes requires management to make significant judgments and estimates for matters whose ultimate resolution may not become known until the final resolution of an examination by the irs or state agencies additionally recording liabilities for uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and developing our best estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid 

we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent results of operations if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes 

we also recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination and settlement with various taxing authorities liabilities for uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we have experienced years when liabilities for uncertain tax positions were settled for amounts different from recorded amounts as described in note 15–income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this annual report on form 10k 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period net of an estimated forfeiture rate 

the fair value of the restricted stock awards and performancebased stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant we use a monte carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of certain performancebased awards with market conditions 

we determine the fair value of stock option awards granted using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model the estimation of stock option fair value requires management to make complex estimates and judgments about among other things employee exercise behavior forfeiture rates and the expected volatility of leidos common stock over the expected option term these judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will ultimately be recognized 

during fiscal 2015 the expected term for all stock option awards granted was derived utilizing the “simplified” method due to the lack of historical experience post separation of new saic and expected volatility was estimated as of each grant date during fiscal 2015 based on a weighted average historical volatility of a group of publiclytraded peer companies for a period consistent with the expected option term due to lack of historical volatility after the spinoff of new saic in fiscal 2014 in the 11month period ended january 1 2016 the expected volatility was estimated using a blended volatility method for a period consistent with the expected term based more significantly on the weighted average historical volatility of a group of publiclytraded peer companies and the weighted average implied volatility from traded options on leidos stock for a time period prior to the grant date 

leidos holdings inc annual report  57 

part ii 

during fiscal 2016 expected volatility was based on using a blended approach which included weighted average historical volatility of a group of publiclytraded peer companies our weighted average historical volatility and the weighted average implied volatility we will continue to use peer group volatility information until sufficient historical volatility of our common stock is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants the expected volatility increased from preacquisition to postacquisition of the isgs business in fiscal 2016 due to a higher allocation of peer group volatility used postacquisition compared to a higher allocation of historical volatility used preacquisition the postacquisition volatility reflected an updated peer group mix for fiscal 2016 we assumed weighted average volatilities of 299  and 379  before and after the acquisition of the isgs business respectively for the 11month period ended january 1 2016 and fiscal 2015 we assumed a weighted average volatility of 245  and 251  respectively if other assumptions are held constant an increase or decrease by 10  in our fiscal 2016 volatility assumptions would have changed the grantdate fair value of our stock options awarded during fiscal 2016 by approximately 12  

the riskfree rate is derived using the yield curve of a zerocoupon us treasury bond with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option on the grant date and was derived in the same manner as in the prior years presented the dividend yield increased from preacquisition to postacquisition due to historical stock price fluctuations we use historical data to estimate forfeitures 

recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of these items see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained with this annual report on form 10k 

effects of inflation 

approximately 51  of our revenues are derived from costreimbursement type contracts which are generally completed within one year bids for longerterm ffp and tm and fploe contracts typically include sufficient provisions for labor and other cost escalations to cover anticipated cost increases over the period of performance as a result our revenues and costs have generally both increased commensurate with inflation and net income as a percentage of total revenues has not been significantly affected 




 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks in the normal course of business our current market risk exposures are primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments contains forwardlooking statements 

interest rate risk   

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to longterm debt obligations and derivatives our policy authorizes with board of directors’ approval the limited use of derivative instruments to hedge specific interest rate risks 

debt obligations and derivatives 

at december 30 2016 and january 1 2016 we had 33 billion  and 11 billion  respectively of fixed and variable rate debt during fiscal 2016 in connection with the acquisition of the isgs business leidos inc secured a new term loan of 690 million  from certain financial institutions as a result of the acquisition leidos assumed the isgs business term loans of 18 billion  which were obtained by the isgs business immediately prior to the transactions these senior secured term loans have variable stated interest rates that are determined based on the libor rate plus a margin as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense additionally during fiscal 2016 we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows with respect to 12 billion  of our variable rate senior secured term loans under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements which mature in december 2021 we will receive variable interest payments based on the onemonth libor rate and will pay interest at a fixed rate of 108  the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings as of december 30 2016 the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements with respect to our variable rate senior secured loans was 26 million  

leidos holdings inc annual report  58 

part ii 

during fiscal 2015 we entered into interest rate swap agreements with respect to all of the 450 million  aggregate principal outstanding on our fixed rate 445  notes maturing in december 2020 the interest rate swap agreements effectively converted a portion of our fixedrate debt to floatingrate debt tied to the changes in the sixmonth libor benchmark interest rate as a result we may experience fluctuations in interest expense under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements we will receive semiannual interest payments at the coupon rate of 445  and will pay variable interest based on the sixmonth libor rate as of december 30 2016 and january 1 2016 the fair value of our interest rate swaps with respect to our fixed rate debt was 3 million  and 8 million  respectively 

the counterparties to these agreements are financial institutions we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes we cannot predict future market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on our interest rate swaps for fiscal 2016 and the 11month period ended january 1 2016 a hypothetical 10 movement in the sixmonth libor rate would have less than a 6 million and 4 million impact respectively on our annual interest expense due to the interest rate swaps for fiscal 2016 a hypothetical 10 movement in the onemonth libor rate would have less than a 3 million impact on our annual interest expense due to the interest rate swaps and variable rate debt for additional information related to our interest rate swap agreements and debt see note 10–derivative instruments and hedging activities and note 11–debt respectively to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report

foreign currency risk 

although the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars some of our transactions are denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers payments to suppliers and certain intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than our or one of our subsidiaries’ functional currency our foreign operations represented 9  of total revenues for fiscal 2016 compared to 4  of total revenues for the 11month period ended january 1 2016

 some of the principal features of the stock compensation plan and the management stock compensation plan together referred to as the stock compensation plans are summarized below which summary is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the stock compensation plans stockholder approval of the stock compensation plans was not required 

summary of the stock compensation plans 

the stock compensation plans have been adopted to provide a longterm incentive to key employees by making deferred awards of shares of leidos stock all officers and employees are eligible to receive awards under the stock compensation plan however only a select group of management and highly compensated senior employees are eligible to receive awards under the management stock compensation plan participation in the management stock compensation plan is limited to individuals that would permit the plan to be treated as a “top hat” plan under applicable internal revenue service and department of labor regulations 

the awarding authority as appointed by our board of directors designates those key employees receiving awards and the number of share units to be awarded each share unit generally corresponds to one share of stock but the employee receiving an award of share units will not have a direct ownership interest in the shares of stock represented by the share units we have established a trust which enables us to transfer shares of leidos stock into the trust for purposes of funding the stock compensation plans’ obligations the trust which is maintained by vanguard fiduciary trust company as trustee under a trust agreement between the trustee and us is a special type of trust known as a rabbi trust in order to avoid current taxation of awards under the stock compensation plans the trust must permit our creditors to reach the assets of the trust in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency 

the awarding authority will establish a vesting schedule of not more than seven years for each award awards will generally vest 100 at the end of the fourth year following the date of award the death of a participant or a change in control of us will result in full vesting of an award a participant will forfeit any unvested portions of the account if the participant’s employment terminates for any reason other than death we receive the benefit of forfeited amounts to satisfy future awards under the stock compensation plans 

participants of the stock compensation plan receive a lump sum distribution of their awards in shares of stock once they become vested while participants of the management stock compensation plan receive a distribution of their awards in shares of stock following termination or retirement participants will be taxed on the value of any amounts distributed from the stock compensation plans at the time of the distribution and shares will be withheld in order to satisfy this obligation 

the daytoday administration of the stock compensation plans is provided by the nonqualified plans committee appointed by our board of directors we have the right to amend or terminate the stock compensation plans at any time and for any reason
