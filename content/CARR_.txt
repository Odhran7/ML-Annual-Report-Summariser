other matters relating to our business as a whole 

competitive conditions 

each of our businesses is subject to significant competition from a number of companies throughout the world due to the nature of our products and services and the markets we serve our competition can vary from regional or specialized companies to larger public or private companies some of our key competitors include daikin industries trane technologies johnson controls lennox international honeywell siemens bosch assa abloy msa safety stanley black  decker newell brands midea group mitsubishi electric and china international marine containers 

the most significant competitive factors we face are technology differentiation product performance service delivery schedule and price brand reputation service to customers and quality are also important competitive factors for our products and services while our competitive position varies among our products and services we are a significant competitor with respect to each of our major product and service offerings we believe that the loss of any individual contract or customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results

raw materials and supplies 

we rely on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials such as copper aluminum and steel in addition we also use semiconductors and other electronic components in the manufacture of our products to maximize our buying effectiveness in the marketplace we have a central strategic sourcing group that consolidates purchases of certain materials and components across our business segments 

the ongoing global economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic has caused significant challenges for global supply chains resulting in inflationary cost pressures component shortages and transportation delays as a result we have incurred incremental costs for commodities and components used in our products as well as component shortages and higher freight costs that have negatively impacted our sales and results of operations we expect that these challenges will continue to have an impact on our businesses for the foreseeable future 

we continue to take proactive steps to limit the impact of these challenges and are working closely with our suppliers to ensure availability of products and implement other cost savings initiatives in addition we continue to invest in our operations and supply chain to improve its resilience with a focus on automation dual sourcing of critical components and localized manufacturing when feasible to date there has been moderate disruption to the availability of our products though it is possible that more significant disruptions could occur if these supply chain challenges continue 

intellectual property 

we maintain a broad portfolio of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licenses and franchises related to our business to protect our research and development investments and to maintain our competitive advantages we hold approximately 9000 active patents and pending patent applications worldwide from time to time we take actions to protect our business by asserting our intellectual property rights against thirdparty infringers we believe that we have taken reasonable measures to build and protect this portfolio of intellectual property rights but we cannot be assured that these rights will not be challenged found invalid or unenforceable 

operating system 

we plan to continue to foster operational financial and commercial excellence to drive sales and earnings growth with roots in our legacy manufacturing and business processes the carrier operating system — carrier excellence — is our continuous improvement framework that is expected to drive operational excellence across our businesses our supplier excellence program is intended to apply these same operating principles to our supply base we also implemented a strategic cost reduction initiative in 2020 that targeted eliminating 700 million in costs over three years through operational efficiency digitalization automation and supply chain productivity carrier 700 this initiative has helped reduce the impact of inflationary pressures experienced during 2021 

joint ventures and strategic relationships 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships are an important part of our business we hold direct ownership interests in approximately 34 joint ventures the financial results of which are accounted for by the equity method of accounting or the cost basis of accounting of which 99 of such investments are in our hvac segment these relationships engage in distribution manufacturing and product development activities and are integral to our business operations and growth strategy 

seasonality 

demand for certain of our products and services is seasonal and can be impacted by weather conditions for instance sales and services of our hvac products to residential customers have historically been higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year which represent the peak seasons for air conditioningrelated sales in north america markets a change in building and remodeling activity also can affect our financial performance in addition our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport equipment including truck production cycles in north america and europe

risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth subsequently any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to our business 

our business financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by covid19 

the global outbreak of covid19 has severely constrained economic activity and as a result has caused a significant contraction in the global economy in response to this outbreak governments have taken preventive or protective actions including imposing restrictions on business operations and travel governments have also implemented economic stabilization efforts and other measures to mitigate the economic effects of the outbreak however the effectiveness and continuation of those measures remains uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the pandemic continues to result in widespread and extended or partial shutdowns and other restrictions on the operations of nonessential businesses specifically due to resurgence in cases and the spread of variants including construction hospitality venues offices and travel the nature and extent of the continuing impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on future developments including the emergence severity and spread of covid19 variants recent and pending approvals of vaccines and boosters the widespread distribution of vaccines and the effectiveness of such vaccines in preventing and decreasing the length and severity of illness from covid19 and its variants and the time it takes to vaccinate a sufficient percentage of the us and global populations nonetheless further prolonged closures and restrictions throughout the world or the rollback of reopening measures due to a resurgence of covid19 cases and continued decreases in the general level of economic activity may again disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers distributors and customers 

as a result of the foregoing the pandemic and its impact have also affected and could continue to affect our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and parts ship finished products to customers the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services and to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations which could result in a decrease andor cancellation of orders andor payment delays or defaults the covid19 pandemic has impacted our supply chain as we experienced disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products facility closures or other restrictions including employee vaccine mandates could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff supply or otherwise maintain our operations further such conditions may also adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy which could impact our ability to fulfill orders on time or at the anticipated cost we also may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access to and cost of financing will depend on among other things global economic conditions conditions in the global financing markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing our results of operations and our credit ratings there is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that it will be available on terms consistent with our expectations any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition labor shortages due to prolonged illness or quarantine or an increase in the cost of labor could adversely affect our profit margins and results of operations 

any recovery from the covid19 pandemic and related economic impact may be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors such as in the united states the current widespread increase in covid19 infections in addition even after the covid19 pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact further many of the factors discussed under risk factors in this form 10k are and we anticipate will continue to be further heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

mandatory covid19 vaccination of employees could impact our workforce and suppliers and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

on september 9 2021 president biden announced a proposed new rule requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to require that their employees be fully vaccinated or tested weekly on november 4 2021 the us department of labor’s occupational safety and health administration “osha” released its covid19 vaccination and testing emergency temporary standard “ets” to carry out this mandate however on january 13 2022 the us supreme court issued a stay 

t able of contents 

on implementation of the ets pending the conclusion of litigation at the sixth circuit court of appeals and in subsequent appeals if applicable on january 25 2022 osha withdrew the ets and asked the sixth circuit to dismiss the case against the ets as moot if osha seeks to implement similar industryspecific rules that apply to carrier businesses the vaccination or weekly testing mandate might present logistical and cost challenges for a large portion of our us operations 

in addition on september 9 2021 president biden issued an executive order “executive order” requiring all employers with us government contracts to ensure that their usbased employees contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of us government contracts are fully vaccinated with no testing alternative on december 17 2021 a federal appeals court confirmed a nationwide injunction against the executive order pending a full case review if the executive order survives judicial review its vaccination mandate may pose staffing issues for our businesses performing work in connection with federal contracts 

our suppliers may also be subject to the executive order or possible new osha rules on vaccinations and testing at this time it is not possible to predict with certainty the nature and extent to which the company or our suppliers will be impacted also additional vaccine mandates may be announced in other jurisdictions in which our businesses or our suppliers operate implementation of these requirements by the company and our suppliers may result in employee attrition including attrition of critically skilled labor and difficulty in fulfilling future labor requirements or obtaining parts components and manufacturing equipment which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

approximately 52 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 are derived from international operations including us export sales as a result changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuating exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our products and the profits generated by our nonus operations because a significant portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars while we attempt to manage our exchange rate risks we are not completely insulated from that exposure exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could reduce our operating margins in various locations outside of the us which would adversely impact the comparability of our results from period to period 

our international sales and operations are also subject to the risks associated with changes in local government regulations and policies regarding investments employment taxation foreign exchange and capital controls and the repatriation of earnings moreover government regulations and policies regarding international trade such as import quotas punitive taxes or tariffs or similar trade barriers whether imposed by individual governments or regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or services or encumber our ability to manufacture or sell or procure products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies by the us or by other countries such as china and mexico where we sell or produce our products and services or procure materials including as a result of the ongoing trade conflict between the us and china could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition our international sales and operations are also sensitive to political and economic instability changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets and the risks associated with differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries 

we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as developing nations around the world increase their demand for our products in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including mexico brazil china india and countries in the middle east emerging markets can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices compliance risks economic and government instability exchange rate fluctuations and the imposition of foreign exchange and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are party to joint ventures and other strategic relationships which may not be successful and may expose us to unique risks and restrictions 

our business operations particularly in our hvac segment depend on various strategic relationships namely joint ventures and nonwholly owned subsidiaries we sell our products and services through certain key distributor joint venture and similar relationships including the carrier enterprise joint ventures with watsco inc the toshiba carrier joint venture with toshiba 

t able of contents 

corporation ahicarrier fzc a united arab emiratesbased joint venture and various joint ventures with members of the midea group 

some of our strategic relationships engage in manufacturing andor product development loss of a key channel partner or a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key channel partner joint venture or similar relationship whether related to among other things a labor strike diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for products or delays in the launch of new products could adversely affect our results of operations in a particular period or the value of our equity investment if we are not successful in maintaining our strategic distribution relationships our financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

in addition our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to our minorityheld joint ventures is limited and can expose us to additional financial and reputational risks we seek to take proactive steps to mitigate these concerns including through audits and similar reviews 

joint ventures and strategic relationships inherently involve certain other risks whether or not we hold a majority interest or maintain operational control in such arrangements our partners and similar business associates may for example 1 have economic or business interests or objectives that are inconsistent with or contrary to our own 2 exercise veto or other rights to the extent available to block actions that we believe are in our or the joint venture’s best interests 3 act contrary to our policies or objectives or 4 be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations 

in addition there can be no assurance that any particular joint venture or strategic relationship will continue to be beneficial to us in the long term for example some of our joint ventures or other strategic agreements prohibit us from competing in certain geographic markets or product and services channels and these restrictions may apply to other products and services we develop or businesses we acquire in the future 

climate change regulations associated with climate change and mitigation efforts could adversely affect our business 

the effects of climate change including increased frequency and intensity of weather conditions and water scarcity create financial risks to our business the potential impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present for example rising sea levels at certain of our facilities changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels the effects of climate change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by increasing insurance and other operating costs the effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks which could similarly increase our operating and material costs we could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them potential adverse impacts from climate change may create health and safety issues for employees operating at our facilities and may lead to an inability to maintain standard operating hours 

there is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert its worst effects increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to 1 generate more international regional andor national requirements to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants eg the kigali amendment to the montreal protocol and the american innovation and manufacturing aim act of 2020 which are essential to many of our products 2 increase building energy and cold chain efficiency and 3 cause a shift away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source including natural gas prohibitions in some instances these requirements may render our existing technology particularly some of our hvac and refrigeration products noncompliant or obsolete and we may be required to make increased capital expenditures to meet new regulations and standards changing interpretations and stricter enforcement of current laws and regulations furthermore our customers and the markets we serve may impose emissions or other environmental standards through regulation marketbased emissions policies or consumer preferences that we may not be able to timely meet due to our required level of capital investment and technology advancement while we are committed to pursuing sustainable solutions for our products there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive position or that economic returns will justify our investments in new product development 

the inconsistent international regional andor national requirements associated with climate change regulations such as the us reentrance into the paris climate agreement also create economic and regulatory uncertainty there is also regulatory

and budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives which if discontinued could adversely impact the demand for energyefficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance 

we have set environmental social and governance goals to be achieved by 2030 which include investing over 2 billion to develop healthy safe sustainable and intelligent buildings and cold chain solutions that incorporate sustainable design principles and reduce lifecycle impacts reducing our customers carbon footprint by more than 1 gigaton achieving carbon neutral operations and reducing energy intensity by 10 across our operations although we intend to meet these goals we may be required to expend significant resources to do so which could increase our operational costs further there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our goals will be achieved or that any future expenditures or investments we make in furtherance of achieving such goals will be available effective meet investor expectations or any binding or nonbinding legal standards regarding sustainability performance for example to make substantial progress toward or to meet some of these goals we may need to purchase or deploy a combination of renewable energy utility contracts carbon credits or offsets energyefficient or lowemission products or operations or carbon sequestration technologies and there can be no assurance of the extent to which such contracts credits offsets products operations or technologies will be available in or effective in reducing emissions or energy intensity moreover we may determine that it is in the best interest of our company and our shareowners to prioritize other business social governance or sustainability investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic regulatory and social factors business strategy or pressure from investors activist groups or other stakeholders if we are unable to make substantial progress toward or meet these goals then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors activist groups or other stakeholders which could adversely impact the perception of us and our products and services by current and potential customers as well as investors which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations 

demand for our hvac products and services is influenced by weather conditions and seasonality 

demand for our hvac products and services representing our largest segment by sales is seasonal and affected by the weather cooler than normal summers depress sales of our replacement air conditioning products and services and warmer than normal winters have the same effect on our heating products historically sales to residential hvac customers tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere regions spring and summer are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services in these circumstances the results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could positively or negatively affect our business and impact overall results of operations 

our business and financial performance depend on continued and substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure which may not yield anticipated benefits and which may be vulnerable to cyberattacks 

the efficient operation of our business requires continued and substantial investments in information technology it infrastructure systems the failure to design develop maintain and implement it technology infrastructure systems in an effective and timely manner or to maintain these systems could divert management’s attention and resources our information systems may also become obsolete because of inadequate investments requiring an unplanned transition to a new platform that could be time consuming costly and damaging to our competitive position and could require additional management attention repeated or prolonged interruptions of service because of poor execution inadequate investments or obsolescence could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services 

cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations 

our business has been and may again in the future be impacted by disruptions to our or thirdparty it infrastructure which have resulted and could in the future result from among other causes cyberattacks infrastructure failures or compromises to our physical security cyberbased risks are evolving and include attacks i on our it infrastructure ii targeting the security integrity andor availability of hardware and software iii on information installed stored or transmitted in our products including after the purchase of those products and when they are installed into thirdparty products and iv on facilities or similar infrastructure such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties and business operations impact the ability of our products to work as intended or result in the unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information in violation of applicable law andor contractual obligations we have experienced cyberbased attacks and due to the evolving threat landscape may continue to experience them going forward potentially with more frequency or severity we continue to make investments and adopt measures to enhance our protection detection response and recovery capabilities and to mitigate potential risks to our technology products services operations and confidential data however depending on the nature sophistication and scope of cyberattacks it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended

in addition because of the global nature of our business our internal systems and products must comply with applicable laws regulations and standards in a number of jurisdictions and government enforcement actions and violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws could be costly or interrupt our business operations any disruption to our business arising from such issues or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated could have an adverse effect on our reputation competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement of or the failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets proprietary technology technical data business processes and other confidential information although we consider our intellectual property rights in the aggregate to be valuable we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them we nonetheless rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements customer and supplier agreements license agreements it security systems internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements it security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access our efforts to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information may not be sufficient however 

we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications 

in addition we may be the target of competitor or other thirdparty patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent the sale and marketing of certain of our products our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession ownership or necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or sale of our products or service offerings or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services any of these events or factors could subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts and thirdparty service providers in our business the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our business performance significant shortages supplier capacity constraints or production disruptions price increases or tariffs could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials such as copper aluminum and steel and on service providers to deliver our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials and services we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products which come from numerous suppliers around the world because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary components for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our supply chain could be impacted by climate change through extreme weather events resulting in delivery or production disruptions and increased material costs in addition other issues with suppliers such as capacity constraints quality issues consolidations closings or bankruptcies price increases raw material shortages or the

decreased availability of trucks and other delivery services could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs 

we use various tactical and strategic actions to mitigate our raw material and supply chain risks and challenges including consolidating commodity purchases locking in prices of expected purchases of certain raw materials proactive engagement with suppliers and our workforce and dynamic management of freight costs and availability however these efforts could cause us to pay higher prices for a commodity when compared with the market price at the time the commodity is actually purchased or delivered our suppliers could be subject to tariffs as well as climate change related regulations compliance with which would increase our costs and the impacts of which are difficult to predict we believe that our supply management and production practices appropriately balance the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless these risks may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including covid19related supplier plant shutdowns or slowdowns transportation delays work stoppages labor relations governmental regulatory and enforcement actions intellectual property claims against suppliers financial issues such as supplier bankruptcy it failure and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters for example we expect to continue to be impacted by the following supply chain issues due to factors largely beyond our control a global shortage of semiconductors a strain on raw materials and cost inflation all of which could escalate in the future insurance for certain disruptions may not be available affordable or adequate the effects of climate change including extreme weather events longterm changes in temperature levels and water availability may exacerbate these risks such disruption has in the past and could in the future interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

our future success depends on designing developing producing selling and supporting innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the regulations applicable to our products as well as our customers’ product and service needs change from time to time moreover regulatory changes inclusive of those aimed at addressing climate change and its impacts may render our products and technologies noncompliant and may subject us to operational compliance and reputational risks our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements or product improvements – including those associated with regulatory changes – depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production and regulatory approval schedules meeting performance plans and expectations the availability of raw materials and parts our suppliers’ performance the hiring training and deployment of qualified personnel achieving efficiencies identifying emerging regulatory and technological trends validating innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and the costs and customer acceptance of our new or improved products 

our products and services also may incorporate technologies developed or manufactured by third parties which when combined with our technology or products creates additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these thirdparty products and services could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace 

our research and development efforts including those that advance environmental sustainability may not culminate in new technologies or timely products or may not meet the needs of our customers as effectively as competitive offerings our competitors may develop competing technologies that gain market acceptance before or instead of our products in addition we may not be successful in anticipating or reacting to changes in the regulatory environments in which our products are sold and the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we anticipate 

we operate in a competitive environment and our profitability and competitive position depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services  

in certain of our businesses our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other factors the cost to timely provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return we must accurately estimate our costs and schedule if we fail to do so the profitability of contracts may be adversely affected – including because some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages if we do not perform on time – which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

customers and others may take disruptive actions 

from time to time customers and others may seek to become suppliers of products and services that compete with our own or pursue other strategies to disrupt our business model for example an affiliate of a customer in our transport refrigeration business produces refrigeration units for shipping containers that compete with our products and another one of our transport refrigeration customers produces refrigeration units for truck trailers that compete with our refrigeration units in addition our customers or existing or future competitors may seek to introduce nontraditional business models or disruptive technologies and products in the industries in which we participate resulting in increased competition and new dynamics in these industries 

labor matters may impact our business 

a significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions or works councils in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates see the section entitled other matters relating to our business as a whole  human capital management we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these agreements before they expire in addition existing agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our specific business or collective bargaining agreements additionally a shortage in certain work forces such as technicians manufacturing workers or truck drivers may impact our business by affecting the ability to produce install sell and deliver our products any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages or labor shortages could have a material adverse effect on our reputation productivity financial condition cash flows and results of operations 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results see note 10 – employee benefit plans to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies 

we may not realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and cost effectively we have and we may from time to time adjust employment levels optimize our footprint andor implement other restructuring activities these activities are complex and may involve or require significant changes to our operations if we do not successfully manage these activities expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses and reputational harm unforeseen delays in the implementation of the restructuring activities additional costs adverse effects on employee morale the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages and difficulty managing our operations during or after facility consolidations any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions harm our business or reputation or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results 

product and service quality issues could harm customer confidence in our company and our brands if certain of our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards – which has been the case – or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we can and have experienced lost sales and increased costs and we can and have been exposed to legal financial and reputational risks actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation as well as government enforcement actions which has also occurred in certain instances in addition when our products fail to perform as expected we are exposed to warranty product liability personal injury and other claims 

we maintain strict quality controls and procedures however we cannot be certain that these controls and procedures will reveal defects in our products or their raw materials which may not become apparent until after the products have been placed in use in the market accordingly there is a risk that products will have defects which could require a product recall or field corrective action product recalls and field corrective actions can be expensive to implement and may damage our reputation 

t able of contents 

customer relationships and market share we have conducted product recalls and field corrective actions in the past and may do so again in the future 

in many jurisdictions product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery if any such claims or contribution requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition a recall or claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other products which could result in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows there can be no assurance that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claims in the future that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims or that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recall repair and replacement costs 

we are subject to litigation environmental and other legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation legal and compliance risks including without limitation claims lawsuits andor regulatory enforcement actions relating to breach of contract cybersecurity and data privacy employment and labor environmental and employee health and safety matters global chemical compliance intellectual property rights personal injury product safety and taxes as well as anticorruption competition and securities laws and other laws governing improper business practices if found responsible in connection with such matters we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments and other damages in certain cases treble damages and experience reputational harm 

as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we operate structure our investments and enforce our rights 

changes in environmental and climate change relatedlaws could require additional investments in product designs which may be more expensive or difficult to manufacture qualify and sell andor may involve additional product safety risks and could increase environmental compliance expenditures 

at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs alleged personal injuries and property damage existing and future asbestosrelated claims could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and putative class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions property damage lawsuits may involve claims relating to environmental damage or diminution of real estate values even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote there is a risk that a negative finding or decision could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have or previously had significant operations or where certain of our products have been manufactured and used 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business certain of our or our channel partners customer relationships are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other anticorruption laws we are also subject to antitrust anticollusion and antimoney laundering laws in various jurisdictions throughout the world despite meaningful measures to ensure lawful conduct which include training audits and internal control policies and procedures we may not always be able to prevent our employees thirdparty agents or channel partners from violating the fcpa or antitrust antimoney laundering or other anticorruption laws as a result we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties as well as disgorgement we could be required to make changes or enhancements to our compliance measures that could increase our costs and we could be subject to other remedial actions 

violations of the fcpa antitrust antimoney laundering or other anticorruption or anticollusion laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations cause reputational harm involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

we are subject to risks arising from doing business with the us government 

as a supplier and service provider to the us government including as a subcontractor under prime contracts with the us government we are subject to certain heightened risks such as those associated with the government’s rights to audit and conduct investigations and with its rights to terminate contracts for convenience or default in light of the current us government contracting environment we are and will continue to be the subject of us government investigations relating to our us government contracts or subcontracts such investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including repayments fines treble and other damages forfeitures restitution or penalties or could lead to suspension or debarment of us government contracting or of export privileges for instance if a business unit were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a us government investigation including fraud or violation of certain environmental or export laws the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts or subcontracts if convicted or found liable the us government could fine and debar us from receiving new awards for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to organic growth in the past several years we have acquired consolidated and minorityowned businesses in an effort to complement and expand our business we expect to continue such pursuits in the future our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s historical activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities or reduced sales as a result of an acquisition’s violation of applicable laws such as the fcpa or other anticorruption laws outside of the us we also may incur – and have incurred – unanticipated costs or expenses including asset impairment and other charges and expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we may encounter – and have encountered – difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations establishing internal controls at these acquired businesses or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize – and have sometimes not realized – the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings subsequent to periods in which we acquire new businesses 

we also make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses such as through guarantees other financial arrangements continued supply and services arrangements or through the retention of liabilities such as for environmental and product liability claims under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses or claims against retained liabilities could result in the imposition of obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

the success of future acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to such transactions and the timing of consummation of such transactions which will depend in part on the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things 

we may recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and certain other intangible assets

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to the capital markets 

carrier has been issued an investment grade credit rating by each of moody’s investors services inc moodys standard  poor’s sp and fitch ratings inc fitch ratings nonetheless any future downgrades could increase our borrowing costs reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of collateral under our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to the capital markets additionally our credit agreements generally provide for an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded 

we incurred debt obligations and we may incur additional debt obligations in the future which could adversely affect our business and profitability and our ability to meet other obligations 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 97 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness see note 7 – borrowings and lines of credit in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and the section entitled liquidity and financial condition in this annual report on form 10k for additional information we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 

our debt obligations could potentially have important consequences to us and our debt and equity investors including 1 requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest payments 2 making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations 3 increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing 4 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 5 reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business 6 limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry 7 placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged and 8 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise pay cash dividends or repurchase shares 

as described in note 7 – borrowings and lines of credit in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and liquidity and financial condition the terms of our indebtedness contain covenants restricting our financial flexibility in a number of ways including among other things restrictions on our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur liens to make certain fundamental changes and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions in addition the revolving credit facility defined subsequently requires that we not exceed a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio  if we breach a restrictive covenant under any of our indebtedness or an event of default occurs in respect of any of our indebtedness our lenders may be entitled to declare all amounts owing in respect thereof to be immediately due and payable 

to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the foregoing risks could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt 

risks related to the separation from utc 

we have operated as an independent company since april 3 2020 the effective date of the distribution and our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results additionally we are a smaller less diversified company than utc prior to the separation and the distribution 

the historical information about carrier in this annual report on form 10k for the periods prior to april 3 2020 refers to carriers businesses as operated by and integrated with utc our historical financial information included in this annual report on form 10k is derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of utc prior to the separation

in addition the diversification of our sales costs and cash flows are diminished as a standalone company such that our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures and investments pay dividends and service debt may be diminished as a standalone company we may also lose capital allocation efficiency and flexibility because we are no longer able to use cash flows from utc or otis to fund our investments and operations 

after the separation and the distribution certain members of management directors and shareowners own stock in utc carrier and otis and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest 

following the separation and the distribution certain members of management and the board of directors of each of utc carrier and otis own common stock in all three companies this ownership overlap could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other two companies for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and carrier’s relationship with utc and otis thereafter these agreements include a separation and distribution agreement the tma the employee matters agreement the intellectual property agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or utc may enter into in the future see note 1 – description of the business in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on these agreements

the distribution was conditioned on among other things the receipt by utc of an irs ruling regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and the distribution and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the distribution under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of utc carrier and otis including those relating to the past and future conduct of utc carrier and otis 

notwithstanding receipt of the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs ruling or the opinion of counsel was based were inaccurate or have not been complied with in addition the irs ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt by utc of the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes including by reason of the consummation of raytheon companys merger with a whollyowned subsidiary of utc shortly after the effective time or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge we as well as utc otis and utc’s shareowners could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes utc would recognize a taxable gain as if it had sold carriers common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and utc shareowners who received carrier common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares even if the distribution were to otherwise qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code it may result in taxable gain to utc but not its shareowners under section 355e of the code if the distribution were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 or greater interest by vote or value in utc or carrier for this purpose any acquisitions of utc or carrier common stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although utc or carrier may be able to rebut that presumption including by qualifying for one or more safe harbors under applicable treasury regulations 

in addition as part of the separation and prior to the distribution utc and its subsidiaries completed an internal reorganization with respect to certain transactions undertaken as part of the internal reorganization utc requested and obtained tax rulings in certain nonus jurisdictions andor opinions of external tax advisors in each case regarding the tax treatment of such transactions such tax rulings and opinions were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations including with respect to certain valuation matters relating to the internal reorganization statements and undertakings of utc carrier otis or their respective subsidiaries if any of these 

t able of contents 

representations or statements were or were to become inaccurate or incomplete or if utc carrier otis or any of their respective subsidiaries did not fulfill or otherwise comply with any such undertakings or covenants such tax rulings andor opinions may be invalid or the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized further notwithstanding receipt of any such tax rulings andor opinions there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant transactions differs from the conclusions reached in the relevant tax rulings andor opinions in the event any such tax rulings andor opinions or the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant transaction we as well as utc and otis could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

under the tma carrier is generally required to indemnify utc and otis for any taxes resulting from the separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from 1 an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of carrier whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition 2 other actions or failures to act by carrier or 3 certain of carrier’s representations covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs ruling andor the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated further under the tma we are generally required to indemnify utc and otis for a specified portion of any taxes and any related costs and other damages a arising as a result of the failure of the distribution and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree including as a result of section 355e of the code or a failure of any internal separation transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree to so qualify in each case to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by or acquisition of equity securities of carrier otis or utc or b arising from an adjustment pursuant to an audit or other tax proceeding with respect to any separation transaction that is not intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree any such indemnity obligations could be material see note 1 – description of the business in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation including the internal reorganization described previously utc completed several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which along with the distribution may be subject to various fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation 1 was insolvent was rendered insolvent by reason of the separation or had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital and 2 received less than fair consideration in exchange for the distribution or intended to incur or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured then the court could void the separation and the distribution in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer the court could then require our shareowners to return to utc some or all of the shares of carrier common stock issued in the distribution or require utc or carrier as the case may be to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit of creditors the measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction and the applicable law generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities including the probable amount of contingent liabilities or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as it matures no assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that carrier or any of our subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the distribution 

risks related to our common stock 

the market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate

the stock markets have experienced volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

shareowners percentage of ownership in carriers common stock may be diluted in the future 

the percentage ownership of shareowners in carriers common stock may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions capital market transactions or otherwise including any equity awards that we grant to our directors officers and employees our employees have and will receive from carrier stockbased awards that correspond to shares of our common stock such awards have had and will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock see note 14 – stockbased compensation and note 18 – earnings per share in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

quarterly cash dividends may be discontinued or modified are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock 

quarterly cash dividends are a component of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with operating cash flows borrowings and divestitures however we are not required to declare dividends dividends may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividends may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends may vary from past practice or from our stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends include market conditions the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the courts within the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareowners which could discourage lawsuits against carrier and our directors and officers 

carrier’s amended and restated bylaws provide that unless carrier’s board of directors otherwise determines the state courts within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of carrier any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee of carrier to carrier or to carrier shareowners including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against carrier or any current or former director or officer or other employee of carrier arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws any action asserting a claim relating to or involving carrier governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in section 115 of the dgcl 

to the fullest extent permitted by law this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims including claims under the federal securities laws including the securities act of 1933 as amended securities act and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act although carrier shareowners will not be deemed to have waived carrier’s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable 

t able of contents 

this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareowners to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareowners find favorable for disputes with carrier or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against carrier and our directors and officers alternatively if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described previously we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

antitakeover provisions could enable our board of directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our shareowners 

carrier’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with carrier’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 1 the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on carrier’s board of directors except in an instance where a director is removed by shareowners and the resulting vacancy is filled by shareowners 2 limitations on shareowners’ ability to call a special shareowner meeting 3 rules regarding how shareowners may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareowner meetings and 4 the right of carrier’s board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareowner approval 

in addition we are subject to section 203 of the dgcl which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that shareowners may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with persons that acquire more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareowners from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with carrier’s board of directors and by providing carrier’s board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make carrier immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareowners and could delay or prevent an acquisition that carrier’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of carrier and our shareowners these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition an acquisition or further issuance of our common stock could trigger the application of section 355e of the code causing the distribution to be taxable to utc under the tma we are required to indemnify utc for the resulting tax and this indemnity obligation might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that our shareowners may consider favorable

our business and financial performance is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending and construction both residential and commercial as well as remodeling in addition our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport equipment including truck production cycles in north america and europe 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce failure to ensure that we have leadership with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability

reporting is complex and may change over time due to changes in our business or in applicable accounting rules we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective if we are not able to maintain or document effective internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

matters affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences including sanctions or investigations by the sec or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules there could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in our company and the reliability of our financial statements confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting this could have a material and adverse effect on us by for example leading to a decline in the share price of our common stock and impairing our ability to raise additional capital

afff is a firefighting foam developed beginning in the late 1960s pursuant to us military specification used to extinguish certain types of hydrocarbonfueled fires primarily at military bases and airports afff was manufactured by several companies including national foam and angus fire utc first entered the afff business with the acquisition of national foam and angus fire in 2005 as part of the acquisition of kidde in 2013 kidde divested the national foam and angus fire businesses to a third party the company acquired kidde as part of its separation from utc in april 2020 during the eight year period of its operation by kidde national foam manufactured afff for sale to government including the us federal government and nongovernment customers in the us at a single facility located in west chester pennsylvania pennsylvania site during the same period angus fire manufactured afff for sale outside the united states at a single facility located in bentham england 

the key components of afff that contribute to its fireextinguishing capabilities are known as fluorosurfactants national foam and angus fire did not manufacture fluorosurfactants but instead purchased these substances from unrelated third parties plaintiffs in the mdl proceedings allege that the fluorosurfactants used by various manufacturers in producing afff contained or over time degraded into compounds known as perflourooctane sulfonate pfos andor perflourooctane acid pfoa plaintiffs further allege that as a result of the use of afff pfos and pfoa were released into the environment and in some instances ultimately reached drinking water supplies 

plaintiffs in the mdl proceedings allege that pfos and pfoa contamination has resulted from the use of afff containing fluorosurfactants manufactured using a process known as ecf they also allege that pfoa contamination has resulted from the use of afff containing fluorosurfactants manufactured using a different process known as telomerization plaintiffs further allege that 3m was the only afff manufacturer that used fluorosurfactants relying on the ecf process and that all other foam manufacturers including national foam and angus fire relied solely on fluorosurfactants produced via telomerization compounds containing pfos and pfoa as well as many other per and polyfluoroalkyl substances known collectively as pfas have also been used for decades by many third parties in a number of different industries to manufacture carpets clothing fabrics cookware food packaging personal care products cleaning products paints varnishes and other consumer and industrial products 

plaintiffs in the mdl proceedings have named multiple defendants including four suppliers of chemicals and raw materials used to manufacture fluorosurfactants four fluorosurfactant manufacturers two toll manufacturers of fluorosurfactants and seven current including national foam and angus fire and former including the company afff manufacturers 

general liability discovery in the mdl proceedings continues preliminary stage discovery in ten bellwether water provider cases was concluded and three of these cases were selected for tier two site specific discovery that discovery is ongoing the mdl court has established a briefing schedule with respect to certain aspects of the government contractor defense potentially applicable to afff sold to or used by the us government or other customers requiring product manufactured to meet military specification such that all briefs were filed at the end of january 2022 with a hearing to follow 

outside of the mdl proceedings the company and other defendants are also party to six lawsuits in us state courts brought by oil refining companies alleging product liability claims related to legacy sales of afff and seeking damages for the costs to replace the product and for property damage in addition the company and other defendants are party to two actions related to the pennsylvania site in which the plaintiff water utility company seeks remediation costs related to the alleged contamination of the local water supply 

the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims in the mdl proceedings and the other afff lawsuits based on the 2013 agreement for the sale of national foam and angus fire the company is pursuing indemnification against these claims from the purchaser and current owner of national foam and angus fire the company is also pursuing insurance coverage for these claims at this time however given the numerous factual scientific and legal issues to be resolved relating to these claims the company is unable to assess the probability of liability or to reasonably estimate the damages if any to be allocated to the company if one or more plaintiffs were to prevail in these cases and there can be no assurance that any such future exposure will not be material in any period

recent developments 

supply chain challenges

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

in early 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of a respiratory disease known as covid19 as a global pandemic in response many countries implemented containment and mitigation measures to combat the outbreak which severely restricted the level of economic activity and caused a significant contraction in the global economy as a result we temporarily closed or reduced production at manufacturing facilities across the globe to ensure employee safety and instructed nonessential employees to work from home in addition we took several preemptive actions during 2020 to manage liquidity as demand for our products decreased despite the adverse impacts of the pandemic on our results beginning in the first quarter of 2020 manufacturing operations resumed and several restorative actions were completed during 2020 including the reinstatement of annual meritbased salary increases and continued investment to support our strategic priorities 

we continue to focus our efforts on preserving the health and safety of our employees and customers as well as maintaining the continuity of our operations in addition we continue to actively monitor our liquidity position and working capital needs and believe that our overall capital resources and liquidity position are adequate the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgments in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period which can have a significant effect on reported amounts however due to significant uncertainty surrounding the pandemic including a resurgence in cases and the spread of covid19 variants managements judgments could change while our results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted the extent of any continuing impact cannot be estimated with certainty at this time

liquidity and financial condition 

we assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash necessary to fund our current and future cash requirements to support our business and strategic initiatives in doing so we review and analyze our cash on hand working capital debt service requirements and capital expenditures we rely on operating cash flows as our primary source of liquidity in addition we have access to other sources of capital to finance our strategic initiatives and fund growth

we believe that our available cash and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs our committed credit facilities and access to the debt and equity markets provide additional sources of shortterm and longterm capital to fund current operations dividends share repurchases debt maturities and future investment opportunities although we believe that the arrangements currently in place permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including 1 our credit ratings or absence of credit ratings 2 the liquidity of the overall capital markets and 3 the state of the economy including the impact of the covid19 pandemic and inflation there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all 

the revolving credit facility and the indentures for our longterm notes contain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that among other things limit carrier and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional liens to make certain fundamental changes and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions on june 2 2020 we entered into an amendment of the revolving credit facility under which certain terms of the facility were amended for a period beginning on june 2 2020 and ending on december 30 2021 the covenant modification w e terminated the covenant modification effective as of august 27 2021 in accordance with procedures for termination set forth in the revolving credit facility which returned the consolidated leverage ratio to the limit in effect prior to the covenant modification  as of december 31 2021 we were compliant with all covenants under the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness 

financing for operational and strategic requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows is subject to the availability of external funds through shortterm and longterm credit markets the access to and cost of financing is dependent upon among other factors our credit ratings the following table presents our credit ratings and outlook as of december 31 2021

discussion of cash flows

cash flows from operating activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with our operations primary activities include net income from operations adjusted for noncash transactions working capital changes and changes in other assets and liabilities we define working capital as the assets and liabilities other than cash generated through our primary operating activities the yearoveryear increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by income generated by our operations after adjusting for noncash transactions in addition lower working capital balances during the current period further added to the increase higher inventory levels driven by continued strong demand and an increase of safety stock due to supply chain constraints were more than offset by higher outstanding accounts payable balances 

cash flows from investing activities primarily represent inflows and outflows associated with longterm assets primary activities include capital expenditures acquisitions and divestitures during the year ended december 31 2021 net cash used in investing activities was 692 million the primary driver of the outflow related to the acquisition of several businesses and a minorityowned business which totaled 366 million net of cash acquired and 344 million of capital expenditures during the year ended december 31 2020 net cash provided by investing activities was 11 billion with the primary drivers of the inflow relating to the proceeds received from the sale of our investment in beijer and the settlement of derivative contracts of 40 million these inflows were partially offset by capital expenditures of 312 million

critical accounting estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgement in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period these estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses as well as the disclosure of 

t able of contents 

contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain actual results could differ from managements estimates 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other asc 350 goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually for impairment or whenever there is a material change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset we test our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances occur 

asc 350 provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment commonly referred to as “step zero” to determine whether a quantitative analysis for impairment is necessary in performing step zero for our impairment test we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to the following the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business industry and market trends and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate if impairment indicators are present after performing step zero we would perform a quantitative impairment analysis to estimate fair value 

for our 2021 impairment test we elected to perform a qualitative step zero assessment for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets this qualitative assessment included the review of certain macroeconomic factors and entityspecific qualitative factors to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets were below carrying value we considered macroeconomic factors including global economic growth general macroeconomic trends for the markets in which our reporting units operate and where the intangible assets are utilized and the forecasted growth of the global industrial products industry in addition to these macroeconomic factors among other things we considered the reporting units’ current results and forecasts changes in the nature of each business any significant legal regulatory contractual political or other business climate factors changes in the industry and competitive environment changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets and any intention to sell or dispose of a reporting unit or cease the use of an indefinitelived intangible assets based upon our qualitative analysis we determined that our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets were not impaired 

revenue recognition from contracts with customers 

revenue is recognized when control of a good or service promised in a contract ie performance obligation is transferred to a customer control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service a significant portion of our performance obligations are recognized at a pointintime when control of the product transfers to the customer which is generally the time of shipment the remaining portion of our performance obligations are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously obtains control as we perform work under a contract or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment 

a performance obligation is a distinct good service or a bundle of goods and services promised in a contract some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation while others contain multiple performance obligations most commonly when a contract spans multiple phases of a product lifecycle such as production installation maintenance and support we identify performance obligations at the inception of a contract and allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation revenue is recognized when or as the performance obligation is satisfied when there are multiple performance obligations within a contract we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price 

we primarily generate revenue from the sale of products to customers and recognize revenue at a point in time when control transfers to the customer transfer of control is generally based on the shipping terms of the contract in addition we recognize revenue on an overtime basis on installation and service contracts for overtime performance obligations requiring the installation of equipment revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress incurred costs represent work performed which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer contract costs include direct costs such as labor materials and subcontractors’ costs and where applicable indirect costs 

t able of contents 

the transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from a customer we include variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount and when it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved in addition we customarily offer our customers incentives to purchase products to ensure an adequate supply of our products in distribution channels the principal incentive programs provide reimbursements to distributors for offering promotional pricing for products we account for estimated incentive payments as a reduction in sales at the time a sale is recognized 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes in accordance with asc 740 income taxes asc 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize future tax benefits to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided we review the realizability of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a review is required and will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate to the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements

we provide a range of benefit plans to eligible current and former employees we account for our benefits plans in accordance with asc 715 compensation – retirement benefits asc 715 which requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension plans the determination of the amounts associated with these benefits is performed by actuaries and dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates expected return on plan assets compensation increases mortality and health care cost trends actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated into accumulated other comprehensive income loss and amortized into net income from operations over future periods we review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends if appropriate 

a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our pension plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations interest cost and service cost as of december 31 2021 



net periodic pension benefit cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected return on plan assets an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased 2021 pension expense by approximately 1 million see note 10 – employee benefit plans in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

contingent liabilities 

we are involved in various litigation claims and administrative proceedings including those related to environmental and legal matters including asbestos in accordance with asc 450 contingencies asc 450 we record accruals for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated these accruals are generally based upon a range of possible outcomes if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other we accrue the minimum amount in addition these estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available we are unable to predict the final outcome of these matters based on the information currently available however we do not believe that the resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

as described in note 23 – commitments and contingent liabilities in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k contractual regulatory and other matters including asbestos claims may arise in the ordinary course of business that subject us to claims or litigation we have recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements related to these matters which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience depending on the nature of the reserve and in certain instances in consultation with legal counsel internal and external consultants and engineers subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition see the risk factors section in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and risk management 

carrier is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices to manage certain of these exposures we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts swaps and options factors that could influence the effectiveness of these hedging programs include currency markets the availability of hedging instruments and the liquidity of the credit markets there has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk for the year ended december 31 2021 

foreign currency exposures we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and other transactions involving foreign currencies we attempt to manage foreign currency transaction exposures through operational strategies and the use of foreign currency hedging contracts while the objective of our hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange rate impact on operating results there may be variances between the gains and losses resulting from the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures because of the duration of certain hedging contracts we do not enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes 

commodity price exposures we are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and fuel costs to ship our products and materials from time to time we may use forward contracts in limited circumstances to manage some of those exposures we do not enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes when hedges are utilized gains and losses may affect earnings derivative activity as of december 31 2021 was not material to our financial statements 

interest rate exposures our longterm debt consists mostly of fixedrate instruments we may issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in interest rates currently we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest rate exposures but may consider such strategies in the future

compliance with the regulation of our business and operations 

we operate our business and sell our products all over the world as a result changes in legislation regulations and government policies including with respect to regulations intended to combat climate change affect our operations and business in the countries regions and localities in which we operate and sell our products such changes which can also render our products and technologies noncompliant involve refrigerants noise levels product and fire safety hydro fluorocarbon emissions fluorinated gases hazardous substances and electric and electronic equipment waste additionally the increased fragmentation of regulatory requirements at various levels of government increases our costs because it necessitates the development of country or regional specific variants monitoring of and compliance with those regulations and additional testing and certifications we do not anticipate that these changes will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our operations are also subject to and affected by environmental regulations promulgated by federal state and local authorities in the us and by authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations most us laws governing environmental matters include criminal penalties we have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment we do not anticipate that compliance with environmental protection laws or that any payments associated with our remediation liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition environmental matters are further addressed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section in this annual report on form 10k note 3 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 25 – commitments and contingent liabilities in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements

raw materials and supplies 

while we believe that we currently have adequate sources for materials components and services we work continuously with our supply base to ensure that we have adequate resources and to reduce costs accordingly we consolidate purchases and suppliers engage in global sourcing implement design changes and implement competitive bidding in certain instances we depend upon a single source of supply or use commodities such as rareearth metals that can be subject to allocations nonetheless we believe that our supply management practices appropriately balance the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our business for example steel copper and aluminum have caused margin and cost pressures we do not foresee near term unavailability that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition however because we have a number of factories and suppliers outside the us the imposition of tariffs or sanctions or unusually restrictive bordercrossing rules could adversely affect our supply chain for further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business see the risk factors section of this annual report on form 10k

risk factors 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth subsequently any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to our business 

our business financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by covid19 

the global outbreak of covid19 has severely constrained economic activity and as a result has caused a significant contraction in the global economy in response to this outbreak governments have taken preventive or protective actions including imposing restrictions on business operations and travel governments have also implemented economic stabilization efforts and other measures to mitigate the economic effects of the outbreak however the effectiveness and continuation of those measures remains uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the pandemic continues to result in widespread and extended or partial shutdowns and other restrictions on the operations of nonessential businesses including construction hospitality venues offices and travel the nature and extent of the continuing impact of covid19 on our business financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on future developments including the recent and pending approvals of vaccines the widespread distribution of vaccines and the effectiveness of such vaccines in preventing covid19 and the time it takes to vaccinate a sufficient percentage of the us and global populations nonetheless further prolonged closures and restrictions throughout the world or the rollback of 

reopening measures due to a resurgence of covid19 cases and continued decreases in the general level of economic activity may again disrupt our operations and the operations of our suppliers distributors and customers 

as a result of the foregoing the pandemic and its impact have also affected and could continue to affect the ability of our customers to pay for our products and services and to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations which has resulted in and could further result in a decrease andor cancellation of orders andor payment delays or defaults such conditions may also adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy which could impact our ability to fulfill orders on time or at the anticipated cost we also may be required to raise additional capital in the future and our access to and cost of financing will depend on among other things global economic conditions conditions in the global financing markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing our results of operations and our credit ratings there is no guarantee that financing will be available in the future to fund our obligations or that it will be available on terms consistent with our expectations any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we have a global business approximately 51 of our net sales for the year ended december 31 2020 is derived from international operations including us export sales as a result changes in local and regional economic conditions including fluctuating exchange rates may adversely affect demand for our products and the profits generated by our nonus operations because a significant portion of our sales and expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars while we attempt to manage our exchange rate risk we are not completely insulated from that exposure exchange rates can be volatile and a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could reduce our operating margins in various locations outside of the us which would adversely impact the comparability of our results from period to period 

our international sales and operations are also subject to the risks associated with changes in local government regulations and policies regarding investments employment taxation foreign exchange and capital controls and the repatriation of earnings moreover government regulations and policies regarding international trade such as import quotas punitive taxes or tariffs or similar trade barriers whether imposed by individual governments or regional trade blocs can affect demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or services or encumber our ability to manufacture or sell or procure products in certain countries the implementation of more restrictive trade policies by the us or by other countries such as china and mexico where we sell or produce our products and services or procure materials including as a result of the ongoing trade conflict between the us and china could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition our international sales and operations are also sensitive to political and economic instability changes in foreign national priorities and government budgets and the risks associated with differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries 

we expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as developing nations around the world increase their demand for our products in addition as part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain countries including mexico brazil china india and countries in the middle east emerging markets can present many risks including cultural differences such as employment and business practices compliance risks economic and government instability exchange rate fluctuations and the imposition of foreign exchange and capital controls while these factors and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we are party to joint ventures and other strategic relationships which may not be successful and may expose us to special risks and restrictions 

our business operations particularly in our hvac segment depend on various strategic relationships namely joint ventures and nonwholly owned subsidiaries we sell our products and services through certain key distributor joint venture and similar relationships including the carrier enterprise joint ventures with watsco inc ahicarrier fzc ahicarrier a united arab emiratesbased joint venture with airconditioning  heating international fzc a subsidiary of united motors  heavy equipment co llc various joint ventures with members of the midea group and toshiba carrier a joint venture with toshiba with which we have several other joint ventures 

some of our strategic relationships engage in manufacturing andor product development loss of a key channel partner or a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key channel partner joint venture or similar 

relationship whether related to among other things a labor strike diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for products or delays in the launch of new products could adversely affect our results of operations in a particular period or the value of our equity investment if we are not successful in maintaining our strategic distribution relationships our financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 

in addition our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to our joint ventures is limited and can expose us to additional financial and reputational risks we seek to take proactive steps to mitigate these concerns including through audits and similar reviews during one such recent audit for example carrier identified certain payments made to ahicarrier over a tenyear period for products sold in the ordinary course by that minorityowned joint venture from entities of undetermined affiliation with ahicarrier’s distributors and customers predominantly based in countries in the commonwealth of independent states carrier does not manage the joint venture and does not direct its treasury or related functions however carrier exercised our audit rights under the joint venture agreement and investigated these thirdparty payments as previously disclosed the company reported the preliminary findings of our investigation to the sec and the us department of justice in february 2020 in december 2020 the sec informed the company that it had concluded its investigation of the matter and did not intend to recommend an enforcement action 

joint ventures and strategic relationships inherently involve certain other risks whether or not we hold a majority interest or maintain operational control in such arrangements our partners and similar business associates may for example 1 have economic or business interests or objectives that are inconsistent with or contrary to our own 2 exercise veto or other rights to the extent available to block actions that we believe are in our or the joint venture’s best interests 3 act contrary to our policies or objectives or 4 be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations 

in addition there can be no assurance that any particular joint venture or strategic relationship will continue to be beneficial to us in the long term for example some of our joint venture or other strategic agreements prohibit us from competing in certain geographic markets or product and services channels and these restrictions may apply to other products and services we develop or businesses we acquire in the future 

climate change and regulations associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 

the effects of climate change including extreme weather conditions create financial risks to our business the effects of climate change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by increasing insurance and other operating costs the effects of climate change also may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in the areas most prone to physical risks which could similarly increase our operating and material costs we could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them 

there is a general consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are linked to climate change and that these emissions must be reduced dramatically to avert its worst effects as a result increased public awareness and concern about climate change will likely continue to 1 generate more international regional andor national requirements to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants which are essential to many of our products 2 increase building energy efficiency and 3 cause a shift away from the use of fossil fuels as an energy source in some instances these requirements may render our existing technology particularly some of our hvac and refrigeration products noncompliant or obsolete while we are committed to pursuing sustainable solutions for our products there can be no assurance that our development efforts will be successful as noted below see we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated  that our products will be accepted by the market that proposed regulations or deregulation will not have an adverse effect on our competitive position or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development 

the inconsistent international regional andor national requirements associated with climate change regulations also create economic and regulatory uncertainty there is also regulatory and budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives which if discontinued could adversely impact the demand for energyefficient buildings and could increase costs of compliance 

demand for our hvac products and services is influenced by weather conditions and seasonality 

demand for our hvac products and services representing our largest segment by sales is seasonal and affected by the weather cooler than normal summers depress sales of our replacement air conditioning products and services and warmer than 

normal winters have the same effect on our heating products historically sales to residential hvac customers tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year because in the us and other northern hemisphere regions spring and summer are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services in these circumstances the results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could positively or negatively affect our business and impact overall results of operations 

our business and financial performance depend on continued and substantial investments in our information technology infrastructure which may not yield anticipated benefits and which may be vulnerable to cyberattacks 

the efficient operation of our business requires continued and substantial investments in information technology it infrastructure systems the failure to design develop and implement new it technology infrastructure systems in an effective and timely manner or to maintain these systems could divert management’s attention and resources our information systems may also become obsolete because of inadequate investments requiring an unplanned transition to a new platform that could be time consuming costly and damaging to our competitive position and could require additional management attention repeated or prolonged interruptions of service because of poor execution inadequate investments or obsolescence could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation and our ability to sell products and services 

in addition our business may be impacted by disruptions to our or thirdparty it infrastructure which could result from among other causes cyberattacks infrastructure failures or compromises to our physical security cyberbased risks are evolving and include attacks i on our it infrastructure ii targeting the security integrity andor availability of hardware and software iii on information installed stored or transmitted in our products including after the purchase of those products and when they are installed into thirdparty products and iv on facilities or similar infrastructure such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties and business operations impact the ability of our products to work as intended or result in the unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information in violation of applicable law andor contractual obligations we have experienced cyberbased attacks and due to the evolving threat landscape may continue to experience them going forward potentially with more frequency or severity we continue to make investments and adopt measures to enhance our protection detection response and recovery capabilities and to mitigate potential risks to our technology products services operations and confidential data however depending on the nature sophistication and scope of cyberattacks it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period as a result we could potentially experience i production downtimes ii operational delays or other detrimental impacts on our operations iii destruction or corruption of data iv security breaches v manipulation or improper use of our or thirdparty systems networks or products and vi financial losses from remedial actions loss of business liability penalties fines andor damage to our reputation—any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition due to the evolving nature of such risks the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted 

in addition because of the global nature of our business our internal systems and products must comply with applicable laws regulations and standards in a number of jurisdictions and government enforcement actions and violations of data privacy and cybersecurity laws could be costly or interrupt our business operations any disruption to our business arising from such issues or an increase in our costs to cover these issues that is greater than what we have anticipated could have an adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers infringement of or the failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success 

the companys intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets proprietary technology technical data business processes and other confidential information although we consider our intellectual property rights in the aggregate to be valuable we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them we nonetheless rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets nondisclosure agreements customer and supplier agreements license agreements information technology security systems internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property we also rely on nondisclosure agreements information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access our efforts to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information may not be sufficient however 

we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will be 

found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications 

in addition we may be the target of competitor or other thirdparty patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent the sale and marketing of certain of our products our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession ownership or necessary licenses concerning data important to the development or sale of our products or service offerings or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services any of these events or factors could subject us to judgments penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services and could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we use a variety of raw materials supplierprovided parts and thirdparty service providers in our business significant shortages supplier capacity constraints or production disruptions price increases or tariffs could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 

our reliance on suppliers and commodity markets to secure components and raw materials such as copper aluminum and steel and on service providers to deliver our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials and services that potential volatility is particularly acute in certain instances where we depend upon a single source issues with suppliers such as delivery or production disruptions capacity constraints quality issues consolidations closings or bankruptcies price increases raw material shortages or the decreased availability of trucks and other delivery services could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs 

we use various strategies to lock in prices of expected purchases of certain raw materials however these efforts could cause us to pay higher prices for a commodity when compared with the market price at the time the commodity is actually purchased or delivered tariffs can also increase our costs the impact of which is difficult to predict however we believe that our supply management and production practices appropriately balance the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices nonetheless these risks may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

we design manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated 

our future success depends on designing developing producing selling and supporting innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies the regulations applicable to our products as well as our customers’ product and service needs change from time to time moreover regulatory changes may render our products and technologies noncompliant our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements or product improvements – including those associated with regulatory changes – depends on a variety of factors including meeting development production and regulatory approval schedules meeting performance plans and expectations the availability of raw materials and parts our suppliers’ performance the hiring training and deployment of qualified personnel achieving efficiencies identifying emerging regulatory and technological trends validating innovative technologies the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and the costs and customer acceptance of our new or improved products 

our products and services also may incorporate technologies developed or manufactured by third parties which when combined with our technology or products creates additional risks and uncertainties as a result the performance and market acceptance of these thirdparty products and services could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own products in the marketplace 

our research and development efforts may not culminate in new technologies or timely products or may not meet the needs of our customers as effectively as competitive offerings our competitors may develop competing technologies that gain market acceptance before or instead of our products in addition we may not be successful in anticipating or reacting to changes in the regulatory environments in which our products are sold and the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we anticipate 

we operate in a competitive environment and our profitability and competitive position depend on our ability to accurately estimate the costs and timing of providing our products and services  

in certain of our businesses our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis our bids are based upon among other factors the cost to timely provide the products and services to generate an acceptable return we must accurately estimate our costs and schedule if we fail to do so the profitability of contracts may be materially and adversely affected – including because some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages if we do not perform on time – which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

customers and others may take disruptive actions 

from time to time customers and others may seek to become suppliers of products and services that compete with our own or pursue other strategies to disrupt our business model for example an affiliate of a customer in our transport refrigeration business produces refrigeration units for shipping containers that compete with our products and another one of our transport refrigeration customers produces refrigeration units for truck trailers that compete with our refrigeration units in addition our customers or existing or future competitors may seek to introduce nontraditional business models or disruptive technologies and products in the industries in which we participate resulting in increased competition and new dynamics in these industries 

labor matters may impact our business 

a significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions or works councils in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates see the section entitled other matters relating to our business as a whole  human capital management we may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these agreements before they expire in addition existing agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes we may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our specific business or collective bargaining agreements additionally a shortage in certain work forces such as technicians or truck drivers may impact our business by affecting the ability to install sell and deliver our products any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results productivity results of operations and reputation 

our defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our results 

the performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results see note 13 – employee benefit plans to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies 

we may not realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 

in order to operate more efficiently and cost effectively we have and we may from time to time to adjust employment levels optimize our footprint andor implement other restructuring activities these activities are complex and may involve or require significant changes to our operations if we do not successfully manage these activities expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses and reputational harm unforeseen delays in the implementation of the restructuring activities additional costs adverse effects on employee morale the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages and difficulty managing our operations during or after facility consolidations any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions harm our business or reputation or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our reputation with customers and negatively impact our results 

product and service quality issues could harm customer confidence in our company and our brands if certain of our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards – which has been the case – or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality we can and have experienced lost sales and increased costs and we can and have been exposed to legal financial and reputational risks actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to 

litigation as well as government enforcement actions which has also occurred in certain instances in addition when our products fail to perform as expected we are exposed to warranty product liability claims personal injury and other claims 

we maintain strict quality controls and procedures however we cannot be certain that these controls and procedures will reveal defects in our products or their raw materials which may not become apparent until after the products have been placed in use in the market accordingly there is a risk that products will have defects which could require a product recall or field corrective action product recalls and field corrective actions can be expensive to implement and may damage our reputation customer relationships and market share we have conducted product recalls and field corrective actions in the past and may do so again in the future 

in many jurisdictions product liability claims are not limited to any specified amount of recovery if any such claims or contribution requests or requirements exceed our available insurance or if there is a product recall there could be an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition a recall or claim could require us to review our entire product portfolio to assess whether similar issues are present in other products which could result in a significant disruption to our business and which could have a further adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows there can be no assurance that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability claim losses in the future that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims or that we will have adequate reserves to cover any recalls repair and replacement costs 

we are subject to litigation environmental and other legal and compliance risks 

we are subject to a variety of litigation legal and compliance risks these risks relate to among other things personal injuries intellectual property rights contractrelated claims taxes environmental matters employee health and safety competition laws and laws governing improper business practices if found responsible in connection with such matters we could be subject to significant fines penalties repayments and other damages in certain cases treble damages and experience reputational harm 

as a global business we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which we operate those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways they may also change from time to time as may related interpretations and other guidance changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we operate structure our investments and enforce our rights 

changes in environmental and climate change relatedlaws could require additional investments in product designs which may be more expensive or difficult to manufacture qualify and sell andor may involve additional product safety risks and could increase environmental compliance expenditures 

at times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs alleged personal injuries and property damage existing and future asbestosrelated claims could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions property damage lawsuits may involve claims relating to environmental damage or diminution of real estate values even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote there is a risk that a negative finding or decision could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have or previously had significant operations or where certain of our products have been manufactured and used 

in addition the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business certain of our or our channel partners customer relationships are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the fcpa and other anticorruption laws we are also subject to antitrust anticollusion and antimoney laundering laws in various jurisdictions throughout the world despite meaningful measures to ensure lawful conduct which include training audits and internal control policies and procedures we may not always be able to prevent our employees thirdparty agents or channel partners from violating the fcpa or antitrust antimoney laundering or other anticorruption laws as a result we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties as well as disgorgement we could be required to make changes or enhancements to our compliance measures that could increase our costs and we could be subject to other remedial actions

we are subject to risks arising from doing business with the us government 

as a supplier and service provider to the us government including as a subcontractor under prime contracts with the us government we are subject to certain heightened risks such as those associated with the government’s rights to audit and conduct investigations and with its rights to terminate contracts for convenience or default we are now and in light of the current us government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of us government investigations relating to our us government contracts or subcontracts such investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liabilities including repayments fines treble and other damages forfeitures restitution or penalties or could lead to suspension or debarment of us government contracting or of export privileges for instance if a business unit were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a us government investigation including fraud or violation of certain environmental or export laws the us government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new us government contracts or subcontracts if convicted or found liable the us government could fine and debar us from receiving new awards for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated 

we engage in acquisitions and divestitures and may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with or disposing of businesses from our current operations therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and divestitures 

we seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to organic growth in the past several years we have acquired various businesses and entered into joint venture arrangements in an effort to complement and expand our business we expect to continue such pursuits in the future our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities or reduced sales as a result of an acquisition’s violation of applicable laws such as the fcpa or other anticorruption laws outside of the us we also may incur – and have incurred – unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges and expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities we may encounter – and have encountered – difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations applying our internal controls to these acquired businesses or in managing strategic investments additionally we may not realize – and have sometimes not realized – the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition accounting requirements relating to business combinations including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses 

we also make strategic divestitures from time to time our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses such as through guarantees other financial arrangements continued supply and services arrangements or through the retention of liabilities such as for environmental and product liability claims under these arrangements nonperformance by those divested businesses or claims against retained liabilities could result in the imposition of obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows results of operations or financial condition 

the success of future acquisitions divestitures and joint ventures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to such transactions and the timing of consummation of such transactions which will depend in part on the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner among other things 

we may recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and certain other intangible assets 

we may recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and certain other intangible assets our other intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks as of december 31 2020 the net carrying value of our goodwill and certain other intangible assets totaled 101 billion and 10 billion respectively in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap we periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired significant negative industry or economic trends disruptions to our business planned or unexpected significant changes in the use of the assets and sustained market capitalization declines may result in the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the period in which the impairment is recognized 

failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity capital position borrowing costs and access to the capital markets 

carrier has been issued an investment grade credit rating by each of moody’s investors services inc moodys standard  poor’s sp and fitch ratings inc fitch ratings nonetheless any future downgrades could increase our borrowing costs reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of collateral under our derivative contracts there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade may have a negative impact on our liquidity capital position and access to the capital markets additionally our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded 

we incurred debt obligations and we may incur additional debt obligations in the future which could adversely affect our business and profitability and our ability to meet other obligations 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 102 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness see note 12 – borrowings and lines of credit in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and the section entitled liquidity and financial condition in this annual report on form 10k for additional information we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 

our debt obligations could potentially have important consequences to us and our debt and equity investors including 1 requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest payments 2 making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations 3 increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing 4 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 5 reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business 6 limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry 7 placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt and 8 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise pay cash dividends or repurchase shares 

as described in note 12 – borrowings and lines of credit in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and liquidity and financial condition the terms of our indebtedness contain covenants restricting our financial flexibility in a number of ways including among other things restrictions on our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur liens to make certain fundamental changes and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions in addition the revolving credit facility defined subsequently requires that we not exceed a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio subject to the amendment also described in note 12 – borrowings and lines of credit if we breach a restrictive covenant under any of our indebtedness or an event of default occurs in respect of any of our indebtedness our lenders may be entitled to declare all amounts owing in respect thereof to be immediately due and payable 

to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness the foregoing risks could increase in addition our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and we may not be able to borrow money sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt 

risks related to the separation from utc 

we have only operated as an independent company since april 3 2020 the effective date of the distribution and our historical financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results additionally we are a smaller less diversified company than utc prior to the separation and the distribution 

the historical information about carrier in this annual report on form 10k for the periods prior to april 3 2020 refers to carriers businesses as operated by and integrated with utc our historical financial information included in this annual report on form 10k is derived from the combined financial statements and accounting records of utc prior to the separation and the distribution our business had been operated by utc as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company as part of utc we were able to enjoy certain benefits from utc’s operating diversity purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with utc’s other businesses additionally utc or one of its affiliates performed or helped perform various corporate functions for us such as accounting auditing tax legal human resources investor relations risk management treasury and other general and administrative functions accordingly the financial information included in this annual report on form 10k for the periods prior to april 3 2020 does not necessarily reflect the financial condition results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate publicly traded company or those that we will achieve in the future 

in addition the diversification of our sales costs and cash flows are diminished as a standalone company such that our results of operations cash flows working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures and investments pay dividends and service debt may be diminished as a standalone company we may also lose capital allocation efficiency and flexibility because we are no longer able to use cash flows from utc or otis to fund our investments and operations 

after the separation and the distribution certain members of management directors and shareowners own stock in utc carrier and otis and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest 

following the separation and the distribution certain members of management and the board of directors of each of utc carrier and otis own common stock in all three companies this ownership overlap could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when the management and directors of one company face decisions that could have different implications for themselves and the other two companies for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and carrier’s relationship with utc and otis thereafter these agreements include a separation and distribution agreement the tsa the tma the employee matters agreement the intellectual property agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates potential conflicts of interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or utc may enter into in the future see note 1 – description of the business in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these agreements 

we could experience temporary interruptions in business operations and incur additional costs as we further develop information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our standalone systems 

we are in the process of finalizing development of an it infrastructure and systems to support our critical business functions including accounting and reporting in order to replace many of the systems and functions utc provided prior to the separation and the distribution we may experience temporary disruption in our business operations as we continue to develop this it infrastructure which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in addition our costs for the operation of these systems may be higher than the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to april 3 2020 

we may not be able to engage in desirable capitalraising or strategic transactions following the separation and the distribution 

under current us federal income tax law a spinoff that otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its shareowners as a result of certain postspinoff transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the spunoff corporation to preserve the taxfree treatment of the separation and the distribution and in addition to carrier’s indemnity obligation described subsequently the tma restricts us for the twoyear period following the distribution except in specific circumstances from 1 entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of the 

shares of carrier common stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise 2 issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds 3 repurchasing shares of carrier common stock other than in certain openmarket transactions and 4 ceasing to actively conduct certain of our businesses the tma also prohibits us from taking or failing to take any other action that would prevent the distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code or for applicable nonus income tax purposes further the tma imposes similar restrictions on us and our subsidiaries during the twoyear period following the distribution that are intended to prevent certain transactions undertaken as part of the internal reorganization from failing to qualify as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code or for applicable nonus income tax purposes these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions repurchases or other transactions that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our shareowners or that might increase the value of our business see note 1 – description of the business in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in connection with the separation into three independent public companies each of utc carrier and otis has agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities if we are required to pay utc andor otis under these indemnities our financial results could be negatively impacted also the utc or otis indemnities may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which utc and otis have been allocated responsibility and utc andor otis may not be able to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and the distribution agreement and certain other agreements among utc carrier and otis each party has agreed to indemnify the other parties for certain liabilities as discussed further in note 1 – description of the business in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements indemnities that we may be required to provide utc andor otis are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that utc andor otis has agreed to retain the indemnities from utc and otis for our benefit may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and utc andor otis may not be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to such indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business 

moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from utc or otis as applicable we may be temporarily required to bear these losses each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock or the stock of utc we as well as utc otis and utc’s shareowners could be subject to significant tax liabilities in addition if certain internal restructuring transactions were to fail to qualify as transactions that are generally taxfree for us federal or nonus income tax purposes we as well as utc and otis could be subject to significant tax liabilities in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify utc for material taxes and other related amounts pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tma 

the distribution was conditioned on among other things the receipt by utc of an irs ruling regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and the distribution and an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the distribution under section 355 of the code the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of utc carrier and otis including those relating to the past and future conduct of utc carrier and otis 

notwithstanding receipt of the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs ruling or the opinion of counsel was based were inaccurate or have not been complied with in addition the irs ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt by utc of the irs ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes including by reason of the consummation of raytheon companys merger with a whollyowned subsidiary of utc 

shortly after the effective time or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge we as well as utc otis and utc’s shareowners could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes utc would recognize a taxable gain as if it had sold the carrier common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and utc shareowners who received carrier common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares even if the distribution were to otherwise qualify as a taxfree transaction under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code it may result in taxable gain to utc but not its shareowners under section 355e of the code if the distribution were deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly shares representing a 50 or greater interest by vote or value in utc or carrier for this purpose any acquisitions of utc or carrier common stock within the period beginning two years before the distribution and ending two years after the distribution are presumed to be part of such a plan although utc or carrier may be able to rebut that presumption including by qualifying for one or more safe harbors under applicable treasury regulations 

in addition as part of the separation and prior to the distribution utc and its subsidiaries completed an internal reorganization with respect to certain transactions undertaken as part of the internal reorganization utc requested and obtained tax rulings in certain nonus jurisdictions andor opinions of external tax advisors in each case regarding the tax treatment of such transactions such tax rulings and opinions were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations including with respect to certain valuation matters relating to the internal reorganization statements and undertakings of utc carrier otis or their respective subsidiaries if any of these representations or statements were or were to become inaccurate or incomplete or if utc carrier otis or any of their respective subsidiaries did not fulfill or otherwise comply with any such undertakings or covenants such tax rulings andor opinions may be invalid or the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized further notwithstanding receipt of any such tax rulings andor opinions there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant transactions differs from the conclusions reached in the relevant tax rulings andor opinions in the event any such tax rulings andor opinions or the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant transaction we as well as utc and otis could be subject to significant tax liabilities 

under the tma carrier is generally required to indemnify utc and otis for any taxes resulting from the separation and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from 1 an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of carrier whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition 2 other actions or failures to act by carrier or 3 certain of carrier’s representations covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs ruling andor the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated further under the tma we are generally required to indemnify utc and otis for a specified portion of any taxes and any related costs and other damages a arising as a result of the failure of the distribution and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree including as a result of section 355e of the code or a failure of any internal separation transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree to so qualify in each case to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by or acquisition of equity securities of carrier otis or utc or b arising from an adjustment pursuant to an audit or other tax proceeding with respect to any separation transaction that is not intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree any such indemnity obligations could be material see note 1 – description of the business in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

potential liabilities may arise due to fraudulent transfer considerations which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in connection with the separation including the internal reorganization described previously utc completed several corporate reorganization transactions involving its subsidiaries which along with the distribution may be subject to various fraudulent conveyance and transfer laws if under these laws a court were to determine that at the time of the separation any entity involved in these reorganization transactions or the separation 1 was insolvent was rendered insolvent by reason of the separation or had remaining assets constituting unreasonably small capital and 2 received less than fair consideration in exchange for the distribution or intended to incur or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay these debts as they matured then the court could void the separation and the distribution in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance or transfer the court could then require our shareowners to return to utc some or all of the shares of carrier common stock issued in the distribution or require utc or carrier as the case may be to fund liabilities of the other company for the benefit 

of creditors the measure of insolvency will vary depending upon the jurisdiction and the applicable law generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair value of its assets was less than the amount of its liabilities including the probable amount of contingent liabilities or if it incurred debt beyond its ability to repay the debt as it matures no assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that carrier or any of our subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the distribution 

risks related to our common stock 

the market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 

the factors that could affect our common stock price include among others 1 industry or general market conditions 2 domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 3 impact of the covid19 pandemic 4 lawsuits enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities 5 changes in our customers’ preferences 6 new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines 7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 8 changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts 9 action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders 10 failure to meet any guidance given by us or any change in any guidance given by us or changes by us in our guidance practices 11 announcements by us of significant impairment charges 12 speculation in the press or investment community 13 investor perception of us and our industry 14 changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies 15 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions dispositions or strategic partnerships 16 war or terrorist acts 17 any future sales of our common stock or other securities and 18 additions or departures of key personnel 

the stock markets have experienced volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources which could harm our business operating results and financial condition 

shareowners percentage of ownership in carriers common stock may be diluted in the future 

the percentage ownership of shareowners in carriers common stock may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions capital market transactions or otherwise including any equity awards that we grant to our directors officers and employees our employees have and will receive from carrier stockbased awards that correspond to shares of our common stock such awards have had and will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock see note 4 – earnings per share and note 14 – stockbased compensation in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

quarterly cash dividends may be discontinued or modified are subject to a number of uncertainties and may affect the price of our common stock 

quarterly cash dividends are a component of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with operating free cash flows borrowings and divestitures however we are not required to declare dividends dividends may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividends may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividends may vary from past practice or from the company’s stated expectations decisions with respect to dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on a variety of factors important factors that could cause us to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends include market conditions the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunities changes in our business strategy the terms of our financing arrangements our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the state courts within the state of delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareowners which could discourage lawsuits against carrier and our directors and officers 

carrier’s amended and restated bylaws provide that unless carrier’s board of directors otherwise determines the state courts within the state of delaware or if no state court located within the state of delaware has jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of carrier any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee of carrier to carrier or to carrier shareowners including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against carrier or any current or former director or officer or other employee of carrier arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws any action asserting a claim relating to or involving carrier governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any action asserting an “internal corporate claim” as that term is defined in section 115 of the dgcl 

to the fullest extent permitted by law this exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims including claims under the federal securities laws including the securities act of 1933 as amended and the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act although carrier shareowners will not be deemed to have waived carrier’s compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that in connection with claims arising under federal securities laws or otherwise a court could find the exclusive forum provision contained in the amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable 

this exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareowners to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareowners find favorable for disputes with carrier or our directors or officers which may discourage such lawsuits against carrier and our directors and officers alternatively if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described previously we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

antitakeover provisions could enable our board of directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our shareowners 

carrier’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with carrier’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover these provisions include among others 1 the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on carrier’s board of directors except in an instance where a director is removed by shareowners and the resulting vacancy is filled by shareowners 2 limitations on shareowners’ ability to call a special shareowner meeting 3 rules regarding how shareowners may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareowner meetings and 4 the right of carrier’s board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareowner approval 

in addition we are subject to section 203 of the dgcl which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that shareowners may favor section 203 provides that subject to limited exceptions persons that acquire or are affiliated with persons that acquire more than 15 of the outstanding voting stock of a delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation including by merger consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a threeyear period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15 of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock 

we believe these provisions will protect our shareowners from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with carrier’s board of directors and by providing carrier’s board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal these provisions are not intended to make carrier immune from takeovers however these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareowners and could delay or prevent an acquisition that carrier’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of carrier and our shareowners these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

in addition an acquisition or further issuance of our common stock could trigger the application of section 355e of the code causing the distribution to be taxable to utc under the tma we are required to indemnify utc for the resulting tax and this indemnity obligation might discourage delay or prevent a change of control that our shareowners may consider favorable 

general risks 

natural disasters epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and may not be fully covered by insurance 

the occurrence of one or more natural disasters power outages or other unexpected events including hurricanes fires earthquakes volcanic eruptions tsunamis floods and other forms of severe weather health epidemics pandemics including covid19 or other contagious outbreaks conflicts wars or terrorist acts in the us or in other countries in which we or our suppliers or customers operate could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters power outages or other unexpected events could damage or close one or more of our facilities or disrupt our operations temporarily or longterm such as by causing business interruptions or by affecting the availability andor cost of materials needed for manufacturing in some cases we have only one factory that can manufacture a specific product or product line as a result damage to or the closure of that factory may disrupt or prevent us from manufacturing certain products existing insurance arrangements may not cover all of the costs or lost cash flows that may arise from such events the occurrence of any of these events could also increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales 

we may be affected by global economic capital market and political conditions and conditions in the construction transportation and infrastructure industries in particular 

our business financial condition operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks and conditions including credit market conditions levels of consumer and business confidence fluctuations in residential commercial and industrial construction activity pandemic health issues including covid19 and its effects natural disasters commodity prices energy costs interest rates foreign exchange rates levels of government spending and deficits trade policies including tariffs boycotts and sanctions regulatory changes actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy 

these economic and political conditions affect our business in a number of ways at this point the extent to which covid19 will continue to impact the global economy remains uncertain but pandemics or other significant public health events or the perception that such events may occur could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally the tightening of credit in the capital markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers including individual endcustomers and businesses to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations which could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services similarly tightening credit may adversely affect our supply base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy additionally because we have a number of factories and suppliers in foreign countries the imposition of tariffs or sanctions or unusually restrictive border crossing rules could adversely affect our supply chain operations and overall business 

our business and financial performance is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity such as decreases in business and consumer spending and construction both residential and commercial as well as remodeling in addition our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport equipment including truck production cycles in north america and europe 

our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 

our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce failure to ensure that we have leadership with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives execute our strategic plan and effectively transition our leadership 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various international jurisdictions changes to tax laws and regulations as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations or other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities additionally in the ordinary course of business we are subject 

to examinations by various tax authorities tax authorities in various jurisdictions could also launch new examinations and expand existing examinations the global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue and additional examinations proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time our competitive position cash flows results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of examinations proceedings and contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty

as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the sec in addition the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing in addition the sarbanesoxley act requires that among other things we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business or changes in applicable accounting rules our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting until we file our first annual report on form 10k with the sec at which time we will be an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer accordingly we expect this attestation at the time we file our annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2021 we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective if we are not able to maintain or document effective internal controls over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting when required 

matters affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences including sanctions or investigations by the sec or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules there could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in our company and the reliability of our financial statements confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting this could have a material and adverse effect on us by for example leading to a decline in the share price of our common stock and impairing our ability to raise additional capital

 item 2 properties 

we operate approximately 1200 sites which comprise approximately 35 million square feet of productive space of these our facilities and key manufacturing sites greater than 100000 square feet comprise approximately 24 million square feet of productive space approximately 60 15 and 21 of these significant properties are associated with our hvac refrigeration and fire  security segments respectively with approximately 4 not associated with a particular segment approximately 32 of these significant properties are leased and the remainder are owned approximately 30 of these significant properties are located in the us 

our fixed assets as of december 31 2020 include manufacturing facilities and nonmanufacturing facilities such as warehouses and machinery and equipment most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment that use special jigs tools and fixtures and that in many instances have automatic control features and special adaptations the facilities warehouses machinery and equipment in use as of december 31 2020 are in good operating condition are wellmaintained and substantially all are generally in regular use 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

asbestos matters 

the company and our consolidated subsidiaries have been named as defendants in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos allegedly integrated into certain carrier products or business premises while the company has never manufactured asbestos and no longer incorporates it into any currentlymanufactured products certain products that carrier no longer manufactures contained components incorporating asbestos a substantial majority of these asbestosrelated claims have been dismissed without payment or were covered in full or in part by insurance or other forms of indemnity additional cases were litigated and settled without any insurance reimbursement the amounts involved in asbestosrelated claims were not material individually or in the aggregate in any period 

the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities are based on currently available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable and are made with input from outside actuarial experts as of december 31 2020 the estimated range of liability to resolve all pending and unasserted potential future asbestos claims through 2059 is approximately 245 million to 276 million where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely the minimum is accrued we have recorded the minimum amount of 245 million and 255 million which is principally recorded in other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively these amounts are undiscounted and exclude the company’s legal fees to defend the asbestos claims which are expensed as incurred in addition the company has an insurance recovery receivable for probable asbestosrelated recoveries of approximately 103 million and 104 million  which is included primarily in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively 

aqueous film forming foam litigation 

aqueous film forming foam afff is a firefighting foam developed in the 1970s pursuant to us military specification and used to extinguish certain types of fires primarily at airports and military bases afff was manufactured by several companies including national foam and angus fire utc acquired the national foam and angus fire businesses in 2005 as part of the acquisition of kidde which has been operated by carrier in 2013 utc divested the national foam and angus fire businesses to a third party 

carrier and many other parties including the thirdparty buyer of the national foam and angus fire businesses have been named as defendants in over 700 cases including putative class actions and other lawsuits alleging that the historic use of afff caused personal injuries and property damage additionally several state and municipal plaintiffs have commenced litigation against the same defendants to recover remediation costs related to historic use of afff in december 2018 the us judicial panel on multidistrict litigation mdl transferred and consolidated all of the afff cases pending in the federal courts to the us district court for the district of south carolina for pretrial proceedings 

plaintiffs in the mdl allege that a chemical ingredient in afff contains or breaks down into compounds known as perflourooctane sulfonate pfos and perflourooctane acid pfoa that were released into the environment and in some instances ultimately leached into drinking water supplies national foam and angus fire purchased these perflourinated 

chemical ingredients from thirdparty chemical manufacturers to manufacture afff chemicals containing pfos and pfoa or their precursors have also been used for decades by many third parties to manufacture carpets clothing fabrics cookware and other consumer products the individual plaintiffs in the mdl generally seek compensatory damages for alleged personal injuries medical monitoring and diminution in property value and injunctive relief to remediate alleged contamination of water supplies the us state municipal and water utility plaintiffs in the mdl generally seek damages and costs related to the remediation of public property and water supplies 

carrier and other defendants are also party to fewer than 10 cases in state court brought by oil refining companies in the us alleging product liability claims related to legacy sales of afff and seeking damages for the costs to replace the product and for property damage 

carrier and other defendants are also party to an action related to the afff manufacturing facility that was operated by national foam and angus fire in which the water utility plaintiffs seeks remediation costs related to the alleged contamination of the local water supply 

we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these claims we are also seeking insurance coverage for these claims at this time however given the numerous factual scientific and legal issues to be resolved relating to these claims carrier is unable to assess the probability of liability or reasonably estimate the damages if any to be allocated to carrier if one or more plaintiffs were to prevail in these cases and there can be no assurance that any such future exposure will not be material in any period 

utc equity awards conversion litigation 

on august 12 2020 several former employees of utc and its subsidiaries filed a putative class action complaint in the us district court for the district of connecticut against raytheon technologies corporation carrier otis the former members of the utc board of directors and the members of the carrier and otis boards of directors  geraud darnis et al v raytheon technologies corporation et al  the complaint challenges the method by which utc equity awards were converted to utc carrier and otis equity awards following the separation and the distribution the complaint asserts that the defendants are liable for breach of certain equity compensation plans and for breach of fiduciary duty and also asserts claims under certain provisions of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa carrier believes that the claims against the company are without merit 

other 

we have commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings selfinsurance programs and matters arising out of the ordinary course of business we accrue contingencies based on a range of possible outcomes if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other we accrue the minimum amount 

in the ordinary course of business carrier is also routinely a defendant in party to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions claims disputes and proceedings these matters are often based on alleged violations of contract product liability warranty regulatory environmental health and safety employment intellectual property tax and other laws in some of these proceedings claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against carrier and could result in fines penalties compensatory or treble damages or nonmonetary relief we do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition

business overview 

separation from united technologies corporation 

on april 3 2020 utc completed the separation through the distribution of all of the outstanding common stock of the company to utc shareowners who held shares of utc common stock as of the close of business on march 19 2020 the record date for the distribution utc distributed 866158910 shares of carrier common stock in the distribution at the effective time as a result of the distribution utc shareowners of record received one share of the companys common stock for every one share of utc common stock and carrier became an independent public company our common stock is listed under the symbol carr on the nyse in connection with the separation carrier issued an aggregate principal balance of 110 billion of debt and transferred approximately 109 billion of cash to utc on february 27 2020 and march 27 2020 on april 1 2020 and april 2 2020 carrier received cash contributions totaling 590 million from utc related to the separation see note 12 – borrowings and lines of credit and note 4 – earnings per share in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

prior to the separation and the distribution the consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position results of operations and cash flows of the company for the periods presented as historically managed within utc for the periods prior to the separation and the distribution the consolidated financial statements were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of utc and thus were prepared on a carveout basis as described subsequently the companys financial statements for the period from april 3 2020 through december 31 2020 are consolidated financial statements based on the reported results of carrier as a standalone company 

the consolidated financial statements include all revenues and costs directly attributable to carrier including costs for facilities functions and services used by carrier prior to the separation and the distribution costs for certain functions and services performed by utc were directly charged to carrier based on specific identification when possible or based on a reasonable allocation driver such as net sales headcount proportionate usage or other allocation methods the results of operations include allocations of costs for administrative functions and services performed on behalf of carrier by centralized groups within utc 

we entered into the tsa with utc and otis in connection with the separation pursuant to which utc provides us with certain services and we provide certain services to utc for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the separation and the distribution the services we receive include but are not limited to information technology services technical and engineering support application support for operations legal payroll finance tax and accounting general administrative services and other support services the costs for these services historically were included in our operating results based on allocations from utc and have not been materially different under the tsa nor do we expect such costs to be materially different when these services are transitioned from utc to carrier 

subsequent to the separation and the distribution we have incurred and will continue to incur expenditures consisting primarily of employeerelated costs costs to establish certain standalone functions and information technology systems and other transactionrelated costs additionally we will have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of becoming an independent publicly traded company primarily from establishing or expanding corporate support for our businesses including information technology human resources treasury tax internal audit risk management accounting and financial reporting investor relations governance legal procurement and other services our estimates of these additional recurring costs expected to be incurred annually are approximately 75 million in the aggregate greater than the expenses historically allocated to us from utc and primarily relate to selling general and administrative expenses we believe our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these additional corporate expenses 

in connection with the separation we entered into the tma with utc and otis that governs the parties’ respective rights responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax matters including responsibility for taxes entitlement to refunds allocation of tax attributes preparation of tax returns control of tax contests and other tax matters subject to certain exceptions set forth in the tma carrier generally is responsible for federal state and foreign taxes imposed on a separate return basis upon carrier or any of our subsidiaries with respect to taxable periods or portions thereof that ended on or prior to the date of the distribution the tma provides special rules that allocate responsibility for tax liabilities arising from a failure of the 

separation transactions to qualify for taxfree treatment based on the reasons for such failure the tma also imposes restrictions on each of carrier and otis during the twoyear period following the distribution that are intended to prevent certain transactions from failing to qualify as transactions that are generally taxfree see note 1 – description of the business in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in connection with the separation we also entered into an employee matters agreement and intellectual property agreement with utc and otis these agreements are not expected to have a material impact on the financial results of carrier 

business summary 

carrier global corporation is a leading global provider of healthy safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions today our portfolio includes industryleading brands such as carrier kidde edwards lenels2 carrier transicold and automated logic that offer innovative hvac refrigeration fire security and building automation technologies to help make the world safer and more comfortable 

our worldwide operations are affected by global and regional industrial economic and political factors and trends these factors and trends include the megatrends of urbanization climate change and increasing requirements for food safety driven by the food needs of our growing global population and the rising standards of living in emerging markets we believe that the companys hvac refrigeration and fire  security business segments are well positioned to benefit from favorable secular trends including these megatrends and from the strength of our industryleading brands and track record of innovation 

the effects of climate change such as extreme weather conditions create financial risks to our business for example the demand for our products and services such as residential air conditioning equipment may be affected by unseasonable weather conditions demand for our hvac products and services representing our largest segment by sales is seasonal and affected by the weather cooler than normal summers depress our sales of replacement air conditioning products and services similarly warmer than normal winters have the same effect on our heating products 

our business is also affected by changes in the general level of economic activity such as changes in business and consumer spending construction activity and shipping activity a change in building and remodeling activity also can affect our financial performance in addition our financial performance may be influenced by the production and utilization of transport equipment including truck production cycles in north america and europe 

business segments 

our operations are organized into three segments hvac refrigeration and fire  security our hvac segment provides products controls services and solutions to meet the heating and cooling and ventilation needs of residential and commercial customers our refrigeration segment provides refrigeration and monitoring systems for trucks trailers shipping containers intermodal and rail as well as commercial refrigeration products our fire  security segment provides a wide range of residential and commercial building systems and security and service solutions our customers are in both the public and private sectors and our businesses reflect extensive geographic diversification see note 1 – description of the business and note 26 – segment financial data in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry higher levels of currency political andor economic risk such as mexico china brazil india and countries in the middle east as of december 31 2020  our net assets in any one of these countries did not exceed 11 of our consolidated equity see note 26 – segment financial data in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of sales attributed to geographic regions 

our earnings growth strategy contemplates earnings from organic sales growth including growth from new product development and product improvements structural cost reductions operational improvements and incremental earnings from acquisitions 

acquisition and restructuring costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred depending on the nature and level of acquisition activity our earnings could be adversely impacted due to acquisition and restructuring actions initiated in connection with the integration of businesses acquired for further discussion of acquisitions and restructuring see note 6 – equity method investments and related parties note 10 – business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets and note 17 – restructuring costs in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

covid19 surfaced in late 2019 and has spread throughout the world in march 2020 covid19 was declared a pandemic by the world health organization and a national emergency by the us government the pandemic has negatively affected the us and global economies disrupted global supply chains and financial markets resulted in significant travel restrictions mandated facility closures and resulted in shelterinplace orders 

carrier has taken and continues to take all prudent measures to protect the health and safety of our employees in particular we have implemented workfromhome requirements where practical social distancing and deep cleaning protocols at all of our facilities as well as travel restrictions among other measures we have also taken appropriate measures which comply with applicable government regulations and guidance to work with our customers to minimize potential disruptions and to support the communities that we serve to address the challenges posed by the pandemic 

the full extent of the impact of covid19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic as well as any worsening or additional outbreaks of the pandemic related containment and mitigation actions taken by the us federal state and local and international governments to prevent disease spread and the rollout of vaccines in the us and internationally including the effectiveness of such vaccines in preventing covid19 and the time it takes to vaccinate a sufficient percentage of the us and global populations the extent of the pandemics impact on carrier will also depend upon our employees ability to work safely in our facilities and to be granted access to vaccines including the time it takes for our employees to be vaccinated our customers’ ability to continue to operate or to receive our products our suppliers ability to continue to supply us with products and the level of activity and demand for the ultimate products and services of our customers or their customers 

in early 2020 we temporarily closed or reduced production at manufacturing facilities in north america asia and europe for safety reasons and in response to lower demand for our products our manufacturing operations have since resumed measures have been enacted to scale capacity to demand and we continue to actively take steps to mitigate supply chain risk we continue to apply appropriate safety measures and have not experienced any significant disruptions to our manufacturing operations we also initiated returntowork protocols at our nonmanufacturing facilities where employees were previously working remotely 

we took preemptive actions in 2020 to preserve our liquidity and manage our cash flows to ensure we met our liquidity needs such actions included but were not limited to modifying the financial covenants in our revolving and term loan credit agreements and issuing 750 million of 2700 notes due 2031 see note 12 – borrowings and lines of credit in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information reducing our discretionary spending our capital investments and general and administrative costs by implementing pay freezes and cuts employee furloughs and the suspension of noncritical hiring and participating in global covid19 relief measures 

critical accounting estimates 

preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities sales and expenses note 3 – summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements we believe that the most complex and sensitive judgments because of their potential significance to the consolidated financial statements result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and are described subsequently actual results could differ from managements estimates 

goodwill and intangible assets 

our goodwill had an aggregate carrying amount of 101 billion as of december 31 2020 our indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of individual trademarks which had an aggregate carrying amount of 571 million as of december 31 2020 

we test our reporting units and trademarks for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or trademark is less than its carrying amount such events and circumstances could include among other things increased competition or unexpected loss of market share increased input costs beyond projections for example due to regulatory or industry changes disposals of significant businesses or components of our business unexpected business disruptions for example due to the loss of a customer supplier or other significant business relationship unexpected significant declines in operating results or significant adverse changes in the markets in which we operate we test reporting units for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount we test trademarks for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each brand with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of a reporting unit or trademark exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount in the case of reporting units any impairment loss would not exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill 

we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived trademarks as of july 1 2020 as part of our annual impairment testing we considered the impact of the adverse effects of covid19 on the global economy and our business and performed a quantitative impairment assessment that compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its associated carrying value to determine whether it was necessary to recognize a goodwill impairment estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and trademarks requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry economic and regulatory conditions which were updated in performing the impairment assessment if current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met if market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change or if management’s expectations or plans otherwise change including as a result of the execution of our global fiveyear strategic plan then one or more of our reporting units or trademarks might become impaired in the future 

we utilize the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the discounted cash flow method relies on estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing growth and margins with due consideration given to forecasting risk we developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit the significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future annual net cash flows for each reporting unit based on projected net sales operating margins working capital and capital expenditures income tax rates longterm growth rates and a discount rate that appropriately reflects the risks inherent in estimating future cash flows we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts based on historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated growth rates and management’s plans for all reporting units the fair value of goodwill exceeded the carrying value resulting in no goodwill impairment however for one reporting unit with goodwill of 917 million the excess of fair value over the carrying value was approximately 13 for this reporting unit a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate used in the financial forecast would result in an impairment of approximately 84 million the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would be negatively impacted if future economic conditions are worse than our financial forecast and assumptions or there are substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions relative to our financial forecast 

for our indefinitelived assets a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology which is based on the implied royalty paid at an appropriate discount rate to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset the significant assumptions inherent in estimating fair value include the estimated future annual net sales for each trademark royalty rates as a percentage of net sales that would hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the brand to an unrelated licensee income tax 

considerations longterm growth rates a discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with the future cost savings attributable to the brand and management’s intent to invest in the brand indefinitely we selected the assumptions used in the financial forecasts based on historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated product category growth rates management’s plans and guideline companies the present value of the aftertax cost savings ie royalty relief indicates the estimated fair value of the asset any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value would be recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess for all trade names the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed as a percentage of carrying value in the 2020 test was a minimum of 80 based upon the quantitative assessment performed the fair value of indefinitelived trademarks was determined to exceed the carrying value resulting in no impairment 

the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows although these assets are not currently impaired there can be no assurance that future impairments will not occur see note 10 – business acquisitions dispositions goodwill and intangible assets in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

revenue recognition from contracts with customers 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted asu 201409 – revenue from contracts with customers and its related amendments new revenue standard and elected the modified retrospective approach the adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on revenue net income or net assets note 5 – revenue recognition in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contains further detail regarding the adoption of the new revenue standard and its impact on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 

we recognize revenue on an overtime basis on installation and service contracts related to our hvac refrigeration and fire  security service businesses for contracts recorded on an overtime basis we measure progress toward completion using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion this overtime basis using an input method requires estimates of future revenues and costs over the full term of product andor service delivery incurred costs represent work performed which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer contract costs are incurred over a period of time which can generally range from several months to years and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment we review our cost estimates on significant contracts on a quarterly basis and for others at least annually or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate we record changes in contract estimates using the cumulative catchup method 

we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assess variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price including contractual discounts contract incentive payments estimates of award fees and other sources of variable consideration when determining the transaction price of each contract variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount these estimates are based on historical experience anticipated performance and managements judgment we also consider whether the contracts provide customers with significant financing although in general our contracts do not contain significant financing 

income taxes 

the future tax benefit arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was 838 million and 923 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits which may be realized over an extended period of time for those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely a valuation allowance is provided 

in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes in tax laws changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted conversely if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts we would decrease a recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made 

in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions we assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements see note 3 – summary of significant accounting policies and note 19 – income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

employee benefit plans 

we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans the major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of increase in employee compensation levels and mortality rates assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of december 31 a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 

the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our pension plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations interest cost and service cost as of december 31 2020 



a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would not have a material impact on our postretirement benefit plan obligations as of december 31 2020 

these estimates assume no change in the shape or steepness of the companyspecific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost a flattening of the yield curve from a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates would increase our net periodic pension cost conversely a steepening of the yield curve from an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates would decrease our net periodic pension cost 

pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected return on plan assets an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased 2020 pension expense by approximately 7 million 

the weightedaverage discount rates used to measure pension liabilities and costs utilize each plan’s specific cash flows and are then compared with highquality bond indices for reasonableness for our significant plans we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows global market interest rates decreased during 2020 compared with 2019 and as a result the weightedaverage discount rate used to measure pension liabilities decreased from 20 in 2019 to 14 during 2020 the weightedaverage discount rates used to measure service cost and interest cost were 18 and 18 respectively during 2020 and 32 and 27 respectively in 2019 

see note 13 – employee benefit plans in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

contingent liabilities 

as described in note 25 – commitments and contingent liabilities in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contractual regulatory and other matters including asbestos claims may arise in the ordinary course of business that subject us to claims or litigation we have recorded reserves in the consolidated financial statements related to these matters which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience depending on the nature of the reserve and in certain instances in consultation with legal counsel internal and external 

consultants and engineers subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition see the risk factors section in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

environmental matters 

our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal state and local authorities in the us and various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations as a result we have established and periodically update policies relating to environmental standards of performance for our operations worldwide we believe that expenditures necessary to comply with the current regulations governing environmental protection will not have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

at the commencement of 2020 we identified 85 locations with reserves for which we may have some liability for remediating contamination however a few of these locations tracked several claims as a group which we are now tracking as 95 separate locations additionally we added two new locations to our remediation program for the year ended december 31 2020 resulting in 97 locations with reserves as of december 31 2020 we do not believe that any individual locations exposure will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations sites in the investigation remediation or operation and maintenance stage represent approximately 85 of our accrued environmental remediation reserve while the remaining 15 reflects administrative costs such as legal fees permits settlements and municipal fees 

we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund at 18 sites the number of superfund sites in and of itself does not represent a relevant measure of liability because the nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility in estimating our liability for remediation we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of other potentially responsible parties to fulfill their obligations 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the outstanding liability for environmental obligations was 239 million and 217 million respectively see note 25 – commitments and contingent liabilities in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 

asbestos matters 

the amounts recorded for asbestosrelated liabilities are based on currently available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable and are made with input from outside actuarial experts the estimated range of total liabilities to resolve all pending and unasserted potential future asbestos claims through 2059 is approximately 245 million to 276 million where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely the minimum is accrued we have recorded the minimum amount of 245 million which is principally recorded in other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 this amount is not discounted and excludes the company’s legal fees to defend the asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed by the company as incurred in addition the company has an insurance recovery receivable for probable asbestos related recoveries of approximately 103 million which is included primarily in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 see legal proceedings for further discussion of the estimated liabilities and insurance recoveries see note 25 – commitments and contingent liabilities in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

results of operations 

the companys financial statements for the periods prior to the separation and the distribution are prepared on a carveout basis as described in note 2 – basis of presentation  the companys financial statements for the period from april 3 2020 through december 31 2020 are consolidated financial statements based on the reported results of carrier as a standalone company 

the following represents our consolidated net sales and operating results dollars in millions 



net sales 



the factors contributing to the total percentage change yearoveryear in total net sales are as follows 



the 6 organic sales decrease for the year ended december 31 2020 reflects lower sales volumes across all of the segments driven by the economic slowdown attributed to covid19 throughout 2020 the organic sales decrease in hvac of 2 reflects declines in commercial hvac and light commercial hvac that were largely driven by the economic slowdown related to covid19 partially offset by increases in north america residential hvac the increase in north america residential hvac sales was driven by new housing starts in addition to higher demand for replacement units due to increased usage attributed to a warmer than normal summer and remote work and school activities associated with covid19 the organic sales decrease of 12 in refrigeration was driven by declines in commercial refrigeration that were primarily due to lower demand and the closure of new equipment installation sites because of covid19 in transport refrigeration in europe and north america due to economic slowdowns related to covid19 and lower truck trailer sales volume in north america when compared with the cyclical peak experienced in 2019 fire  security sales decreased 9 organically reflecting lower product and field service sales the decline in product sales was primarily driven by lower volume in north america and emea due to covid19 field service sales were down primarily in europe and asia reflecting the impact of business shutdowns and project delays as a result of covid19 for additional discussion on the segment results for 2020 see the section entitled segment review 

the organic sales increase of 1 for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by growth in hvac 1 and in fire  security 1 partially offset by declines in refrigeration 1 hvac organic sales growth was driven by stronger sales in north america residential hvac and by growth in commercial hvac in asia and the americas organic sales growth in fire  security was driven by stronger product sales globally as well as field service growth primarily within asia the decline in refrigeration was driven by transport refrigeration primarily the container business partially offset by growth in north america truck trailer as well as a decline in commercial refrigeration primarily in europe the divestiture related sales decrease in 2019 was due to the sale of taylor in 2018 which was part of refrigeration 

cost of products and services sold 



the factors contributing to the percentage change yearoveryear in total cost of products and services sold are as follows 



the 6 organic decrease in the cost of products and services sold for the year ended december 31 2020 is consistent with the 6 organic sales decrease largely attributed to the economic slowdown related to covid19 

the decrease in total cost of products and services sold for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by favorable foreign currency translation and net acquisition and divestiture activity which more than offset increases from organic sales growth higher tariffs and unfavorable commodity prices 

gross margin 



the 20 basis point increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales for 2020 reflects the benefit from favorable material productivity partially offset by the effects of lower sales volumes largely as a result of the economic slowdown resulting from covid19 

gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points for the year ended december 31 2019 as the favorable impact of pricing and productivity net of unfavorable commodity prices and tariffs was more than offset by unfavorable mix the absence of a favorable prior year contract adjustment related to a large commercial project and the unfavorable yearoveryear impact resulting from the revaluation of certain longterm liabilities 

selling general and administrative 



the 59 million increase in selling general and administrative expenses for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily attributed to a yearoveryear increase of 75 million in onetime separation related costs 75 million in costs associated with carriers transition to an independent publicly traded company and other costs increased separation and public company costs were partially offset by cost containment initiatives implemented to mitigate the impact of covid19 which included furloughs temporary pay freezes and pay cuts and reductions in discretionary spending lower restructuring costs of 61 million the absence of a 34 million charge incurred in 2019 related to the impact of a consultant contract termination and lower costs associated with the winddown of a residential intrusion business of 21 million as a percentage of sales the 140 basis point increase was primarily driven by lower sales as a result of covid19 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 72 million for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by 53 million of costs related to the separation and a consultant contract termination fee of 34 million neither of which were incurred in 2018 partially offset by lower yearoveryear corporate allocations from utc 

we are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions to keep our cost structure competitive the amounts reflected previously include the impact of restructuring actions on selling general and administrative expenses for further discussion see note 17 – restructuring costs in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

equity method investment net earnings 



investments over which we do not exercise control but have significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting equity method investment net earnings decreased 29 million for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily due to lower earnings from our investments in hvac joint ventures in asia and the middle east primarily due to the impact of covid19 and the adverse impact of a product performance matter at one of our hvac joint ventures 

in 2020 we sold our equity ownership in beijer for 14 billion and recognized a pretax gain of approximately 11 billion following the sale carrier no longer has equity ownership in beijer for the year ended december 31 2020 carrier recognized 27 million of equity method investment net earnings related to our equity ownership in beijer 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated equity method investments increased by 16 million for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily due to stronger earnings from our hvac equity method investments in europe and asia 

see note 6 – equity method investments and related parties in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other income expense net 



other income expense net primarily includes the impact of gains and losses related to sale of ownership in our equity method investments or infrequently occurring items the yearoveryear change of 10 billion for 2020 is primarily attributed to a 11 billion gain on the sale of our equity ownership in beijer the favorable 37 million yearoveryear impact related to otherthantemporary impairment charges of 71 million in 2020 and 108 million in 2019 was offset by the absence of gains on the sale of equity method investments and real property of 79 million and 19 million in charges related to litigation matters in 2020 

the yearoveryear decrease of 939 million in other income expense net for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by the absence of a prior year gain of 799 million from the divestiture of taylor as well as the 2019 impairment of an equity method investment of 108 million 

interest expense income net 



prior to the separation and the distribution interest income and interest expense related primarily to interest on related party activity between carrier and utc see liquidity and financial condition and note 6 – equity method investments and related parties in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

interest expense income net reflects 315 million higher yearoveryear interest expense net for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with 2019 due to the issuance of 925 billion of longterm fixed rate notes in february 2020 a 175 billion draw on our term loan credit facility defined subsequently in march 2020 the issuance of 750 million of longterm fixed rate notes in june 2020 and a decrease in interest income earned on related party receivables due from utc in the three months ended december 31 2020 carrier prepaid the 175 billion term loan credit facility for which 26 million of interest expense was recognized in the year ended december 31 2020 see note 12 – borrowings and lines of credit in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

interest expense income net decreased for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared with 2018 which primarily reflects changes in interest earned on related party receivables due from utc 

income taxes 



the increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the prior year is primarily due to the absence of a prior year combined tax benefit of 149 million resulting from the filing by a carrier subsidiary to participate in an amnesty program offered by the italian tax authority and the conclusion of an audit by the irs for utc tax years 2014 2015 and 2016 in addition the following tax costs were recorded for the year ended december 31 2020 a 51 million adjustment related to a valuation allowance recorded against a united kingdom tax loss and credit carry forward resulting from separationrelated activities and an adjustment of 46 million resulting from carriers decision to no longer permanently reinvest certain pre2018 unremitted nonus earnings 

the 2019 effective tax rate reflects a net tax benefit of 149 million as a result of the filing by a subsidiary of carrier to participate in an amnesty program offered by the italian tax authority and the conclusion of the audit by the examination division of the irs for the utc 2014 2015 and 2016 tax years 

the 2018 effective tax rate reflects a net tax charge of 102 million as a result of utc ceasing to assert that it intended to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries the effective income tax rate for 2018 also reflects the incremental tax cost associated with the divestiture of taylor 

for further discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate see critical accounting estimates — income taxes and note 19 – income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

segment review 

we determine our segments based on how our chief executive officer who is our chief operating decision maker codm allocates resources assesses performance and makes operational decisions the codm allocates resources and evaluates the financial performance of each of our segments hvac refrigeration and fire  security based on net sales and operating profit adjustments to reconcile segment reporting to the consolidated results for 2020 and 2019 are included in the section entitled eliminations and other and general corporate expenses

2020 compared with 2019 





the organic sales decrease of 2 reflects declines in north america light commercial hvac 15 and commercial hvac 9 largely driven by the economic slowdown resulting from covid19 partially offset by increases in north america residential hvac 10 commercial hvac sales declined globally except in china which saw an increase the residential hvac sales increase was driven by new housing starts in addition to higher demand for replacement units attributed to increased usage as a result of a warmer than normal summer and remote work and school activity resulting from covid19 

the operational profit decrease of 15 was primarily attributed to lower sales volumes and unfavorable mix and increased selling general and administrative costs including higher costs associated with carrier’s transition to an independent publicly traded company partially offset by favorable net material productivity 

the increase in other of 71 primarily reflects a 11 billion gain on the sale of the companys equity ownership in beijer partially offset by a 108 million impairment charge related to a minorityowned joint venture investment in 2019 

2019 compared with 2018 





the organic sales increase of 1 primarily reflects stronger north america residential hvac sales 2 in addition to growth for commercial hvac offerings in asia 3 and the americas 2 partially offset by declines in emea 9

2020 compared with 2019 





the organic sales decrease of 12 was driven by declines in transport refrigeration 14 and commercial refrigeration 9 the decline in transport refrigeration sales reflects lower sales volume in north america when compared with the cyclical peak experienced in 2019 and the economic slowdown resulting from covid19 and europe truck trailer sales volume decreased due to covid19 commercial refrigeration sales declined primarily due to lower demand and the closure of new equipment installation sites resulting from covid19 

the operational profit decrease of 29 was primarily attributed to lower sales volumes and unfavorable mix increased selling general and administrative costs including higher costs associated with carriers transition to an independent publicly traded company partially offset by favorable net material productivity 

the 5 decrease in other primarily reflects the yearoveryear impact of the absence of a 22 million gain on an expropriated plant in 2019 

2019 compared with 2018 





the organic sales decrease of 1 was driven by declines in transport refrigeration sales 1 primarily in the container business 9 and declines in commercial refrigeration 1 primarily in europe partially offset by growth in north america truck trailer 5

2020 compared with 2019 





the organic sales decrease of 9 reflects lower product 10 and field service 9 sales the decline in product sales was primarily driven by lower volume in north america and emea resulting from covid19 field service sales were down primarily in europe and asia reflecting the impact of business shutdowns and project delays resulting from covid19 

the operational profit decrease of 22 was primarily attributed to lower sales volumes and higher provisions for customer credit losses partially offset by favorable material productivity 

2019 compared with 2018

eliminations and other and general corporate expenses 



2020 compared with 2019 

eliminations and other reflects the elimination of sales other income and operating profit resulting from activity between segments net hedging and foreign exchangerelated gains and losses as well as other infrequently occurring items such as divestiture transaction costs in addition eliminations and other includes costs associated with the settlement and defense of potential future asbestosrelated claims insurance settlements on asbestosrelated matters and revisions in the estimated liability for potential future asbestosrelated claims intersegment sales eliminations decreased for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with 2019  

for the year ended december 31 2020 the 28 million yearoveryear decrease in operating profit in eliminations and other compared with 2019 was primarily attributed to 54 million in incremental separationrelated costs and higher deferred compensation charges of 16 million partially offset by the absence of a 34 million charge incurred in 2019 related to the impact of a consultant contract termination 

general corporate expenses include allocations of corporate expenses from utc prior to the separation and the distribution which are not necessarily indicative of our future expenses and do not necessarily reflect the results that carrier may experience as an independent company for the periods presented 

2019 compared with 2018 

the yearoveryear decrease in sales eliminations for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared with 2018 reflects a decrease in the amount of intersegment eliminations 

the yearoveryear change in operating profit within eliminations and other for the year ended december 31 2019 is primarily due to separationrelated costs of 58 million a 34 million charge related to the impact of a consultant contract termination and lower asbestosrelated settlement gains of 31 million partially offset by the absence of 15 million of divestiture transaction costs in 2018 

the yearoveryear change in general corporate expenses for the year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by higher general and administrative expenses 

liquidity and financial condition 



 

not measurable nm  prior to the separation and the distribution carrier participated in utcs centralized cash management and financing programs as such these metrics are neither meaningful nor comparable to those of carrier as a standalone company see note 6 – equity method investments and related parties in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the utc cash management programs 

prior to the separation and the distribution carrier participated in utc’s centralized cash pooling and financing programs historically we independently generated operating cash flows sufficient to fund our working capital capital expenditures and financing needs following the separation and the distribution the capital structure and sources of liquidity for carrier changed as carrier no longer participates in cash management and financing programs with utc instead carrier’s ability to fund our capital requirements depends on our ability to generate cash flows from operations f ollowing the separation and the distribution carrier has access to a 20 billion revolving credit facility defined subsequently that supports a commercial paper borrowing program and anticipates continuing to have access to the debt capital markets we believe that our future operating cash flows and anticipated access to capital will provide sufficient sources of liquidity over the next twelve months to meet our commitments including the negative impact of covid19 on our business 

from time to time we may need to access the capital markets to obtain financing although we believe that the arrangements currently in place permit us to finance our operations on acceptable terms and conditions our access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including 1 our credit ratings or absence of credit ratings 2 the liquidity of the overall capital markets and 3 the state of the economy including the impact of covid19 there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us if at all 

financing for operational and strategic requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows is subject to the availability of external funds through shortterm and longterm credit markets the access to and cost of financing is dependent upon among other factors the companys credit ratings the following table presents our credit ratings and outlook as of december 31 2020  



1  the longterm rating for sp was affirmed on june 15 2020 and for moodys on june 16 2020 fitch ratings longterm rating was issued on june 11 2020 

2 sp revised its outlook to negative from stable on june 15 2020 

as of december 31 2020  we had cash and cash equivalents of 31 billion of which approximately 33 was held by carrier’s foreign subsidiaries we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed if held by foreign subsidiaries on occasion we are required to maintain cash deposits in connection with contractual obligations related to acquisitions or divestitures or other legal obligations as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the amount of such restricted cash was approximately 4 million and 5 million respectively 

borrowings and lines of credit 

longterm debt consisted of the following 



on february 10 2020 carrier entered into a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to 20 billion pursuant to an unsecured unsubordinated revolving credit facility that matures on april 3 2025 as amended the revolving credit facility a commitment fee of 0125 is charged on the unused commitments borrowings under the revolving credit facility are available in us dollars euros and pounds sterling and bear interest at a variable interest rate based on libor plus a ratingsbased margin which was 125 basis points as of december 31 2020 the revolving credit facility supports our commercial paper program and cash requirements as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings on the revolving credit facility 

on february 10 2020  carrier entered into a term loan credit agreement providing for a 175 billion unsecured unsubordinated term loan credit facility which matures on february 10 2023 as amended the term loan credit facility on march 27 2020 carrier drew the full 175 billion available and in the three months ended december 31 2020 we fully prepaid the 175 billion outstanding under the term loan credit facility the term loan credit facility was subject to a variable interest rate based on libor plus a ratingsbased margin which immediately prior to the repayment date in the three months ended december 31 2020 was 1125 basis points in connection with the full prepayment of the term loan credit facility the term loan credit agreement was terminated 

on february 27 2020 carrier issued 925 billion of unsecured unsubordinated longterm fixed rate notes in six series with maturities ranging from 2023 through 2050 carrier used the proceeds from such longterm fixed rate notes and the term loan credit facility to fund approximately 109 billion in distributions to utc in connection with the separation 

the revolving credit agreement and indenture contain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that among other things limit carrier and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional liens to make certain fundamental changes and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions on june 2 2020 the company entered into an amendment of the revolving credit facility pursuant to the amendment certain terms of the revolving credit facility were amended for a period beginning on june 2 2020 and ending on december 30 2021 the covenant modification period the company may terminate the covenant modification period prior to december 30 2021 subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions the amendment defers testing of our consolidated total net leverage ratio financial covenant until june 30 2021 and increases the consolidated total net leverage ratio limit until december 31 2021 the amendment also requires us to maintain liquidity at a certain level until the earlier of 1 june 29 2021 and 2 the last day of the covenant modification period additionally during the covenant modification period the company is subject to a limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness b limitations on the making of restricted payments including purchases by the company of our ordinary shares and the amount of dividends the company may pay and c a most favored nations provision related to certain terms of any committed credit facility in an amount greater than 100 million as of december 31 2020 we were compliant with all covenants under the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness 

on june 19 2020 carrier issued 750 million of unsecured unsubordinated 2700 notes due in 2031 these notes rank equally with our other unsecured unsubordinated obligations we used the net proceeds from the sale of such notes which further enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during the ongoing covid19 pandemic for general corporate purposes 

as of december 31 2020 we have a 20 billion unsecured unsubordinated commercial paper program which we plan to use for general corporate purposes including the funding of working capital and potential acquisitions as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program 

interest payments related to indebtedness are expected to approximate 291 million per year reflecting an approximate weightedaverage interest rate of 28 

share repurchase program 

on february 4 2021 the company’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 350 million of the company’s outstanding common stock share repurchases may take place from time to time subject to market conditions and at the company’s discretion in the open market or through one or more other public or private transactions 

other 

the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets the level of market interest rates and actuarial mortality and other assumptions we can contribute cash subject to applicable regulations as of december 31 2020 our qualified domestic defined benefit pension plans are approximately 109 funded on a projected benefit obligation basis and we are not required to make additional contributions through the end of 2022 we expect to make total contributions of approximately 28 million to our global defined benefit pension plans in 2021 contributions to our global defined benefit pension plans in 2021 are expected to meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

cash flows 



cash flows  2020 compared with 2019 

cash provided by operating activities was 17 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 compared with 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 the 371 million yearoveryear decrease in cash provided by operating activities was attributed to lower net income from operations net of noncash adjustments partially offset by 446 million in cash provided from working capital due to the timing of vendor payments and income taxes 

net cash provided by investing activities increased 14 billion in the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the year ended december 31 2019 due to the receipt of 14 billion from the sale of our equity ownership in beijer 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 13 billion in the year ended december 31 2020 compared with the year ended december 31 2019 net transfers to utc increased 84 billion due to the separation and were funded by the issuance of 110 billion in longterm debt of which the 175 billion term loan credit facility was prepaid in the three months ended december 31 2020 on june 19 2020 carrier issued 750 million in notes due 2031 to enhance financial flexibility during covid19 

cash flows  2019 compared with 2018 

cash provided by operating activities was 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 which was consistent with the 21 billion provided by operating activities in the year ended december 31 2018 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 674 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the year ended december 31 2018 due to the absence of 10 billion in proceeds received from the 2018 sale of taylor partially offset by a 310 million decrease in cash outflows for acquisitions 

prior to the separation our financing activities primarily related to net transfers to utc net cash used in financing activities decreased 645 million in the year ended december 31 2019 compared with the year ended december 31 2018 primarily due to a decrease in net transfers to utc 

offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we extend a variety of financial guarantees to third parties in support of our business we also have obligations arising from environmental health and safety tax and employment matters circumstances that could cause the contingent obligations and liabilities arising from these arrangements to come to fruition include changes in an underlying transaction nonperformance under a contract or deterioration in the financial condition of the guaranteed party

other longterm liabilities include liabilities representing obligations under product service and warranty policies estimated environmental remediation costs and expected contributions and liabilities under employee benefit programs the timing of expected cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these agreements and is largely based upon historical experience 

obligations to utc under the tma include carrier’s obligations to pay 453 million to utc resulting from the tcjas mandatory transition tax attributable to carrier this amount will be settled with utc in five future payments the next of which is scheduled in april 2022 see note 19  income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

• the company is selfinsured for workers compensation general liability and group healthcare benefits the companys selfinsurance reserve totaled 249 million and 239 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively selfinsurance liabilities are based on estimates and actuarial assumptions the amount and timing of payments can fluctuate and for this reason they are not included in the previous table

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk and risk management 

carrier is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices to manage certain of those exposures we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts swaps and options these hedging activities provide limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks factors that could influence the effectiveness of these hedging programs include currency markets the availability of hedging instruments and the liquidity of the credit markets there has been no significant change in our exposure to market risk for the year ended december 31 2020 

foreign currency exposures 

we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and other transactions involving foreign currencies we attempt to manage foreign currency transaction exposures through operational strategies and the use of foreign currency hedging contracts while the objective of our hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results there may be variances between the gains and losses resulting from the hedging contracts and the underlying exposure because of the length of certain hedging contracts carrier does not enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes 

commodity price exposures 

we are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and from time to time we may use forward contracts in limited circumstances to manage some of those exposures in the future if hedges are utilized gains and losses may affect earnings there were no outstanding hedge derivatives as of december 31 2020 

interest rate exposures 

our longterm debt consists mostly of fixedrate instruments we may issue commercial paper which exposes us to changes in interest rates currently we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest rate exposures but may consider such strategies in the future
